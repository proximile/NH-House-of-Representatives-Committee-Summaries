and all of coast county and i am here to
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
introduce senate bill 445 which makes
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
some technical changes to
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 85 which we passed last year
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
that established the broadband matching
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
grant fund and this fund was originally
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
set up to
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
use arpa funds
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
to our towns or our counties or our
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
providers for um bringing broadband to
 
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
providers for um bringing broadband to
the

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
homes that don't currently have it and i
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
think the um
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic highlighted the the need for
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
broadband in the state for with everyone
 
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
working from home or schooling from home
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
what the senate did this year was to
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
change that 50-50 to 75-25
 
00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:08.469 align:start position:0%
change that 50-50 to 75-25
so

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're matching more of the federal
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
funds against the local funds so that'll
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
help a lot more projects get done
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
especially for our communities that are
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
using their local funds to do the
 
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.430 align:start position:0%
using their local funds to do the
expansion

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
and it also uh allocated all of the
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
122 million dollars that we received
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
from the federal government into the
 
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.950 align:start position:0%
from the federal government into the
fund

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
the fund the wording on the allocation
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
does allow for
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
the department bea to
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal if they would like to
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
spend the dollars for any other purpose
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
follows the rules of the federal
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
government and there are purposes that
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the department can tell you
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
about that may happen
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
um in the future we are expecting
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
another 100 million dollars for
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
broadband expansion and other um
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
connectivity expansion so there are
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
other opportunities to perhaps add money
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
to this fund
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
but anyway i'm happy to take questions
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh yes
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
senator will this um finally bring the
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
north country
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
fully on board
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
just i can't imagine what it's been like
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
for families that haven't had access um
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
during the last two years it's it is
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
very difficult for for a lot of people
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
there are plans underway to advance
 
00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
there are plans underway to advance
getting

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
all perhaps hopefully all of new
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire hooked up
 
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
i do believe that there's enough money
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
in the fund to do that in the entire
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and my apologies
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
i did forget that there is an amendment
 
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.710 align:start position:0%
i did forget that there is an amendment
um

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
one three five one s that adds one word
 
00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
one three five one s that adds one word
um

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
to uh section two b of the of the bill
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that's um
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh if you're looking at the amendment
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's the word successful and i'm trying
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
line 11 thank you
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
a provider who successfully
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
um challenges an applicant's eligibility
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
so it just adds successfully in there
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
represent representative uh sure my mind
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
my mind is blank edwards
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you madam chair i i think
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
i have just two questions um one of them
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
is related to the phrase make ready
 
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.190 align:start position:0%
is related to the phrase make ready
process

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm unfamiliar with that term does
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
that need to be defined somewhere in
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
statute or is that such a well
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
understood term by normal people that i
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i think um someone who
 
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i think um someone who
um

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
is more familiar perhaps from the
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
department could answer that because
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
they have rules set up already for this
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
sure okay uh and then
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
i i'm glad there's an amendment to um
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
that that picks up the word successfully
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
a provider who successfully challenges
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
because when i read that multiple times
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't quite understand what we were
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do there
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
are you able to walk us through an
 
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
are you able to walk us through an
example

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
to help us help me understand
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
what what's happening there if if if
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
there's an application
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the f and the and the
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
construction has already begun
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
but it gets successfully challenged
 
00:11:45.519 --> 00:11:46.710 align:start position:0%
but it gets successfully challenged
meaning

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
what what kind of a successful challenge
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
would there be and and what are the
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
ramifications so um and again some
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
people behind me could probably answer
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
the questions to the what a successful
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
challenge would look at like from an
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
industry level but my understanding is
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
that if there's already a project
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
happening and then somebody wants to get
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
funds for another project that would
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
duplicate the same efforts across
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
to the same homes or to the same
 
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.509 align:start position:0%
to the same homes or to the same
businesses

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
the provider that is already doing it
 
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
the provider that is already doing it
could

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
could challenge that that wouldn't
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
happen and then if it's successful then
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
that person applying for those funds
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
would not get those funds
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
all right at the layman terms no i like
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
that i'll i'll
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
ask again thanks
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um could you
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
why the 50 50 is not adequate and why
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
you're looking for 75.25
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
so the um just looking at the numbers of
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
of the money that's coming into state
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
for broadband we have enough money to
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
match 75 percent
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
from this fund to the local 25
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
or provider 25
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
so we don't need we there's enough money
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead please
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh senator
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
i just had a curiosity question once
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
that once this is installed
 
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.230 align:start position:0%
that once this is installed
using

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
a municipality and arpa money who owns
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
the who owns it does it convert to what
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
the operating s operator at that i
 
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
the operating s operator at that i
think

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
with um and
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
i don't know if a locality would want to
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
oper own and operate their own lines so
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
i imagine it would be with the
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
operator but that i think that's whoever
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
the contract is with i would have to
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
specify that
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh rep representative lynn yes i i have
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh a question sort of along the um the
 
00:14:05.189 --> 00:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
same lines uh as the last one and that
 
00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:05.910 align:start position:0%
same lines uh as the last one and that
is

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that a
 
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.069 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that a
municipality

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
is either legally
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
limited to only contracting with one
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
with one provider for the municipality
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
or if if not legally limited is that
 
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.389 align:start position:0%
or if if not legally limited is that
typically

00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities operate
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
well i don't sorry thank you for the
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
question it looks like
 
00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
question it looks like
right

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
now but i know that if
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
if currently if an operator provides the
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
service that's required the upload and
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
download speeds
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
and again i'm not a techie person so i
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
don't understand all that side of stuff
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
but if there's already provider that
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
does that
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
to to the homes in your community then
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be another provider that
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
comes in to do that same
 
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
comes in to do that same
service

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding somebody behind
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
me might be able to correct me on that
 
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.829 align:start position:0%
me might be able to correct me on that
thank

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's not really a question this is an
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
answer uh
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
in my town we it was what they call a
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
franchise fee
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:24.470 align:start position:0%
and the
the

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.670 align:start position:0%
the
provider

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
pays the town
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of money
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
to operate in our town okay so that's
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's the way our town works and i
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%

think i'll wait for
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
somebody with the technical knowledge
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
together another question
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
no offense taken
 
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.509 align:start position:0%
no offense taken
[Laughter]

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
by the way don't ask me those technical
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
questions okay just just in case you
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
were thinking that
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
i should know
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
okay

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative irf didn't
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
see you
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%

senator

00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity why is section one
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
necessary and why is the word
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation used
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
these funds can already be approved if
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken by the fiscal and
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
governor and council to go for this
 
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
governor and council to go for this
purpose

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for the question
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative section one uh senate uh
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
when we drafted this and senate finance
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to keep this in here because the
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
state already has these monies and we
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if any of these
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
funds are used for another purpose other
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
than the broadband matching grant
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
initiative that
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature has an opinion on that
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
and they would go before fiscal to say
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
yes you know
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
we see that you are meeting the intent
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
of the initiative and we recognize that
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
you need these funds
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
for overhead or
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
to do this other
 
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
to do this other
project

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
hodge hodgdon is that similar is that
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
close enough
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
well you hit it on the head
 
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.430 align:start position:0%
well you hit it on the head
okay

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh members of the committee my

just here to offer our support
for

00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh this legislation and uh really
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
in an effort not to repeat anything as
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey said
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
um i'll just
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
provide a couple thoughts and
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
make myself available to answer any
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have i as she
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
said that the primary impetus for this
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation after
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature adopted what started out
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
as senate bill 85 and then became a part
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the the budget last year
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
is that when policymakers created the
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
current statute there wasn't a clear
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of whether or to what
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
extent or what the federal guidance
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
would look like
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
for the federal dollars that were coming
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
down the pike we we knew and could
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
expect that there would be federal
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
resources for broadband but we didn't
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
fully understand
 
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.710 align:start position:0%
fully understand
what

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
constraints or guardrails may exist and
 
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.150 align:start position:0%
constraints or guardrails may exist and
this

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislation seeks to just better align
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
what was passed last year with what the
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
final guidance was for
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
arpa's capital projects fund and what
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
the statute says
 
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
the statute says
for

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and jobs act
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have final
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
guidance yet on that ladder bill but the
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
statute's far far more specific than
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
arpa so
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
i think just
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
generally speaking this may answer a
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
couple of the questions that were asked
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
providers in the state have done a good
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
job over the last few years
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
narrowing in on that last three four
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
five percent of unserved but while
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's a relatively small percentage
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about tens of thousands of
 
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.390 align:start position:0%
we're talking about tens of thousands of
homes

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
and and some businesses even in the
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
state that continue to lack
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh broadband it's a reasonable estimate
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
is anywhere between 20 and 30 000
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
remaining locations in the state uh and
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just the north country although
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
the north country certainly has its
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
share of unserved pockets
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
interior grafton interior sullivan parts
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
of cheshire
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know even a few
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
remaining pockets in hillsborough and
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
merrimack are are unserved and
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislation like this will help
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
to uh get over that hump so that we can
 
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.029 align:start position:0%
to uh get over that hump so that we can
finally

00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
substantially reduce those numbers
 
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.029 align:start position:0%
substantially reduce those numbers
so

00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
our ask or urge of you is to support
 
00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.669 align:start position:0%
our ask or urge of you is to support
this

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment um well i haven't seen it
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
before today
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
seems to make perfect sense uh the
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
the challenge provision is to ensure
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
that these dollars are only spent where
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
they're truly needed and we we have 95 6
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
of the state that's covered served by
 
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
of the state that's covered served by
providers

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that we
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
focus these dollars and these
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
partnerships in areas where people are
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
truly lacking service while
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
220 plus million dollars is a
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
fantastically large sum of money
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
these are very very expensive projects
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
it is not unusual to see
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
construction costs run
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
60 70 80 000 a mile
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
and when you're in a rural area with
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
four or five six
 
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.630 align:start position:0%
four or five six
homes

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
maybe eighty percent of
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh folks will ultimately decide to take
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
a service you can imagine just how
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
challenging the business model is so
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
with that i'll conclude my
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'd be happy to answer
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh represent turcotte did you wish to
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
ask your question
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
sure thank you madam chair uh the
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
question i had is uh to be clear
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh a community or street or whatever
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
that's already served by broadband would
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
not be eligible for this that's correct
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's so broadband is a very binary
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
exercise you either have it or you don't
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
the way that the new hampshire law is
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
currently structured
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
is to look at it in that fashion it it
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
is a house by house analysis of where
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
service is available where service isn't
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
available and the and this anticipates
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
directing those funds in areas that are
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
unserviced on service unserviceable
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
representative petrie yeah thank you
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking one
 
00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.190 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking one
question

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
some of these really remote places
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be easier to just do a
 
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be easier to just do a
satellite

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
satellite
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
it may be and as a practical matter
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
satellite either low earth orbit or
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
geosynchronous is currently available
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
in virtually all places it's not
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
universally available because of sort of
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
peculiar peculiarities of geography
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
funds are really intended
 
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.350 align:start position:0%
funds are really intended
to

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
support the the construction of wired
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
terrestrial networks
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
structured in such a way
 
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.070 align:start position:0%
structured in such a way
to

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
for all intents and purposes direct
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
funds towards terrestrial networks and
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
away from
 
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.230 align:start position:0%
away from
satellite

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
satellite
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the case of all funds you may
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
have heard of what is known as the
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
ardoff which is an fcc program rural
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
digital opportunity fund
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
viasat and a couple other satellite
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
providers are recipients of those funds
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
so that's a another source of federal
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
money that is available for
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
those non-wired
 
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.630 align:start position:0%
those non-wired
services

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative earth
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
so that kind of answered my question but
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
why is there such a strong bias to
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
hardwired connections when not only are
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
satellite connections available now but
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated ones and faster ones
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
are coming down the pike if i'm not
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
mistaken yeah i think what we've seen
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
i began in the industry in 2006 and at
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
customer bandwidth consumption was in
 
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
customer bandwidth consumption was in
the

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
high megabits a month low gigabits a
 
00:23:41.679 --> 00:23:42.630 align:start position:0%
high megabits a month low gigabits a
month

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's now nearing a terabit a month
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
thousand gigabits and the speeds offered
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
by these networks our network is 500
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
times faster
 
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.190 align:start position:0%
times faster
than

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.350 align:start position:0%
than
[Music]

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
what we were offering 15 years ago so
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
and those enhancements have been made
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
demand the consumer demand for bandwidth
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
is just continues to skyrocket we see
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
a doubling of the utilization of our
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
network every 18 months
 
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.549 align:start position:0%
network every 18 months
and

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
modern terrestrial broadband networks
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
offer levels of service capacity
 
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:19.510 align:start position:0%
offer levels of service capacity
and

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
have shown themselves to be broadly
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
accepted by the consumer marketplace in
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
a way that we just haven't seen with
 
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.110 align:start position:0%
a way that we just haven't seen with
satellite

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
satellite
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that this decision to
 
00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:30.310 align:start position:0%
and i think that this decision to
structure

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
these arpa funds and the bead program
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
which is coming down the road is just a
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
recognition of that on the part of
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
and there was a question about make
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
ready um if i may um sorry so make ready
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
is the process by which utility poles
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
are literally made ready
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
for an additional attachment like a
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
broadband provider to go on that pole
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
it is a process regulated by the public
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
utilities commission
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
now in part doe and it is uh it's a bit
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
of term of art but it is a well
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
understood process
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
access to utility poles is one of the
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
few remaining monopoly choke points in
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
the telecommunications industry there's
 
00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:13.669 align:start position:0%
the telecommunications industry there's
only

00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
one set of polls by and large in any
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
given right away so it remains a
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
regulated process and uh and how that
 
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
regulated process and uh and how that
occurs

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
is is well understood
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you madam
 
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.310 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you madam
chair

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.430 align:start position:0%
chair
so

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
i have a question concerning the service
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
here is now i live in peterborough and
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's some areas as you know probably
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
that don't have coverage in peterborough
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
and sharon in hillsborough county
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
but as recently as last fall
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
a company called consolidated
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
came into our neighborhood put
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
underground cables in and presently
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
comcast serves our neighborhood
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i asked the service provider why
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
were they providing
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
additional service
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they said well the federal
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
government is paying for this so we're
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
adding this additional service to your
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it didn't make any sense
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
for me at the time is that what you're
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
referring to another federal program to
 
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.909 align:start position:0%
referring to another federal program to
provide

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
service to communities that don't have
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
it but we already have it but somebody
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
is paying for consolidated to put this
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
service in so if you go to the fcc's
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
website and look under ardoff rural
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
digital opportunity fund rdof you'll see
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
a map of areas in the state of new
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire where
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
certain providers have sought and been
 
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
awarded funds
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
those areas should not be in any area
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
where there's already
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
another competitive provider
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
and by and large that's the case i mean
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
they went through a process to make sure
 
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:47.909 align:start position:0%
they went through a process to make sure
like

00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statute contemplates they
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
went through a process to make sure that
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
these dollars just weren't spent where
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
they weren't needed and by and large
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's the case
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh there are areas
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
sharon there are areas
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
of green field there are areas
 
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
of green field there are areas
uh

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
to your to north and west of you where
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that are ardoff recipients so i
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
i suspect that there's just confusion
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
about exactly
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
why there was construction going on in
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
in your neighborhood because
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
rdof funds were not
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
invested by the fcc for
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
areas like peterborough where there's
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chief
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.149 align:start position:0%
representative
okay

00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
i thought i was having a hard time today
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair all right thank you very
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
much uh madam chair the question i have
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
is that in cowards county there are
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
areas where a
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
not on main roads but on side roads
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
where a home would want to have
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
broadband but the situation exists that
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
a provider
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
refuses because a quarter it the last
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
connection is like a quarter or a half
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
mile down the road in
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
any and they say that unless all of the
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
homes along that stretch
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
want it they will not provide it to that
 
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:16.710 align:start position:0%
want it they will not provide it to that
boom

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
boom
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
will this bill clarify that situation
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
so i believe it will because what's
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
happening is
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
you know every provider has a different
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
business model but they try to apply
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
their model
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
to the market opportunity that they see
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
in a given area and that given area can
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
be as small as
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
one home a street with a few homes or a
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
whole town
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
and they do an analysis of whether or
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
not they can
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
make the numbers work and if they can't
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
then they can if they can they can and
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
on the margins i have absolutely seen
 
00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.990 align:start position:0%
on the margins i have absolutely seen
situations

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh i mean in representative leishman's
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
community there was a time
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
sought to work out a similar deal off of
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
route 136 where we essentially were
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
trying to make the numbers work by
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
figuring out who's interested who's not
 
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.350 align:start position:0%
figuring out who's interested who's not
interested

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know we never had a you have to hit
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
this number to make it work
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
but it was it was an effort to figure
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
out can we make it work
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
and uh so you see that uh
 
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.350 align:start position:0%
and uh so you see that uh
as

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know that goes to my earlier point
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
about how really
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
deploying broadband is a pretty binary
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
exercise you try to figure out whether
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
you can make it work for a given house
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
or or not and that's
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's one provider's way of trying to
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
figure out if they can make it work
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.470 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
um

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
on the amendment
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
do you have it in front of you okay so
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna ask you to
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
paint a picture for me because these
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
these words are not creating a scenario
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
in my head
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
a provider who successfully challenges
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
an application's eligibility for funding
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
because the construction has commenced
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
shall complete construction as soon as
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
practical and without undue delay
 
00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
who who are the parties in this sentence
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
and what what's happening here
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
so the parties as i said the make ready
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
process is a regulated
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
process it includes timelines by which
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
various entities are involved in
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
construction have to or should comply
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
so those entities are the poll owners
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
which are typically
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
sure so those entities
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
in the in the make ready process those
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
entities are typically the incumbent the
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
two poll owners are one poll owner the
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
incumbent electric utility the incumbent
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
telephone utility and then whoever the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
provider is who wants access to the
 
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
provider is who wants access to the
polls

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
polls
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that's that's one of the
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh that's part of the process of getting
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
these networks built is is making those
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
polls ready and then the other party
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh to it is is the firm who's doing the
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
work the construction aspect of it and
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
then to a lesser extent you know any
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
sort of government engagement through
 
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.430 align:start position:0%
sort of government engagement through
permitting

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh that that's
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
almost never
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
a constraining factor in construction
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for the effort i still don't
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
understand the sentence i don't know
 
00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:30.230 align:start position:0%
understand the sentence i don't know
like

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
a provider who successfully challenges
 
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.789 align:start position:0%
a provider who successfully challenges
right

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
who is that if if if they're the ones
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
doing the work
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
right then why would they challenge
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
their own work
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
because the rest of the sentence then
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
tells them
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
that even if they're successful in
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
challenging themselves
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
they still have to complete the
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
construction as soon as possible that's
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
the way that reads yeah let me step back
 
00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.590 align:start position:0%
the way that reads yeah let me step back
and

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
maybe better explain it so
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
has a policy statement that says we want
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
to invest only in areas that are
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
unserved that would otherwise not be
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
able to receive broadband
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the way that you
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
ensure that those dollars are being
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
spent only in areas that need it
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
is that you create because of the lag
 
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
is that you create because of the lag
time

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
and the the complexity of how many
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
providers are in the marketplace
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
providing service the surest way to
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that you're not spending money
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
where it should not be spent
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
is to have a process where a provider
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
can say
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm already providing service there i
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
made the investment we're providing
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
service to customers
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
or we're currently building in that area
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
and the currently building piece can be
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
months it takes time to do this there's
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
some seasonality and then there's that
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
make ready process to get the job done
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
so right now to give you an example
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
so we currently have
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
under construction
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
network that includes 4 800 utility
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
poles in the state of new hampshire it's
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
about 125 miles of infrastructure
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
and that is like currently
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
you know budgeted by us to complete the
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
work actively in construction
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's a large i mean that's
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
in a relatively large town that's an
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
entire town's worth of construction road
 
00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.789 align:start position:0%
entire town's worth of construction road
miles

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
miles
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
so what the state law says is we we do
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
not want to use scarce federal resources
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
there in those areas we want the private
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
sector to expend their money
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
and build their networks we want to
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
focus the money in areas that are
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
that are truly needed and that's that's
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
what the challenge process allows it it
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
allows a provider to say
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
we already serve area a or
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
we're already
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
building currently building in area b
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
and as this was working its way through
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
the senate the question was all right
 
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.789 align:start position:0%
the senate the question was all right
well

00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
like what does that mean what does under
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
construction mean so
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
this language explains what it means
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
which is it's
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
an area where the make ready process has
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
begun which is a well understood process
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight by the puc and doe
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
and and then it
 
00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
and and then it
we

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
language was added to ensure that
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
once construction begins
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's done in a an expeditious manner
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
which is the language used as
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
must be shall be completed
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
as soon as practical and without until
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
do do delay because there was a desire
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
all these areas
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
get the service that
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
that's coming to them
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what that uh that language
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
does all right thank you
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh and my apologies if this was covered
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
but um i'm just thinking of shelburne
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
and i know that's not part of your area
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
so the dynamic has changed in other
 
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.349 align:start position:0%
so the dynamic has changed in other
words

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking they were
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
lacking broadband services for a
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
considerable length of time in my
 
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
considerable length of time in my
understanding

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
was that there was not enough demand
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
or enough custom potential customers to
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
provide that service and
 
00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:24.390 align:start position:0%
provide that service and
and

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
this changes that is that
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
correct increase the environment right
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
shelburne's a good example i'm not we
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
don't serve shelburne but i'm
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
fairly well bring it up yeah uh familiar
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
with it um
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so in the last few years the
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
spectrum which is the
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
cable company that serves
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
the anderson valley valley
 
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.790 align:start position:0%
the anderson valley valley
has

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
begun to build out into shelburne
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
stretching out from
 
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
stretching out from
gorham

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
gorham
 
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.270 align:start position:0%
gorham
east

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
east
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
but there are still areas of town that
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
are not covered by their network and
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
then the incumbent telephone provider
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
consolidated has done the same so what
 
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
consolidated has done the same so what
this

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
program the broadband matching grant
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
initiative allows is that for those
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
unserved areas a provider can
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's in partnership with the
 
00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.109 align:start position:0%
whether it's in partnership with the
community

00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be a partnership of some sort
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
between the community the provider
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the state to secure the resources to
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
build out those areas that are not
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
currently served that's right it may
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
follow up yes you may so um
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
and if this is covered again apologize
 
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:28.230 align:start position:0%
and if this is covered again apologize
but

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
to prioritize who gets what when
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
and again i'm thinking of shelburne um
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
now what is that process or is that
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
dynamic changed or is it uh by demand or
 
00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
is it what up to the company's
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
discretion or how is that
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
priorities established for
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
unserved customers
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
priorities are determined by an analysis
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
of whether or not a given area is
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
financially feasible
 
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.750 align:start position:0%
financially feasible
right

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.630 align:start position:0%
right
this

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
changes that calculus in a way
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
a lot more of these areas are now going
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
to be financially feasible
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
right because there's a there's a source
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
of federal funds
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
can be used to change the math
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's a lot harder if you're asking me
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
how do you decide which project to build
 
00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:24.390 align:start position:0%
how do you decide which project to build
first

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
that is a lot more complicated and
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
probably it's beyond what i can answer
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
now okay
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you madam chair
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
you know we're a relatively large
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
provider we're currently building
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
40 different projects in 40 different
 
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.710 align:start position:0%
40 different projects in 40 different
towns

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
of varying sizes right now so it's
 
00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:46.630 align:start position:0%
of varying sizes right now so it's
it's

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
not exactly it's not a linear
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
progression in the sense that you
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
put 100 percent of your effort into one
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
then you move on to the next and the
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
next the next so
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and i i'm thinking you
 
00:37:59.890 --> 00:37:59.900 align:start position:0%
should move north but anyways thank you
 
00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:01.990 align:start position:0%
should move north but anyways thank you
[Laughter]

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative emrick thank you madam
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
chair i'll ask you the same question i
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
asked senator hennessey once once these
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
funds are invested and there's a build
 
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:12.630 align:start position:0%
funds are invested and there's a build
out

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
and and you're the provider yes do you
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
take over those lines
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
to maintain them and own them so that
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
our expectation is that if we partner in
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be contributing
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the non-federal matches so the
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
25 percent minimum match that'll be our
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
contribution with our private at-risk
 
00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
contribution with our private at-risk
capital

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
and then when the project is done we'll
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
own operate and be responsible for all
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
upgrades and maintenance for it the
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
statute um it's not on the bill but the
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
statute that passed last year actually
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
is very clear about that no grant
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
dollars can be used for maintenance it's
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
so that what that does hopefully is
 
00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:58.230 align:start position:0%
so that what that does hopefully is
enforce

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
some sustainability when companies are
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
looking at these projects
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
you don't want to invest this money
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
and then have
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
someone decide that it it can't sustain
 
00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.430 align:start position:0%
someone decide that it it can't sustain
itself

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.829 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
representative
mooning

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
mooning
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
testifying going back to that proposed
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
amendment by senator hennessey the line
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
a provider who successfully challenges
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
could we delete the words because
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
construction has commenced
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
and would that
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
improve for clarity so
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
to be clear um
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
senator as i understand it senator
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
hennessey's amendment only differs from
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
the bill that came over from the senate
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
but with the addition of the word
 
00:39:43.599 --> 00:39:45.430 align:start position:0%
but with the addition of the word
successfully

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's not the only change to the bill is
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
the addition of the word successfully
 
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.109 align:start position:0%
the addition of the word successfully
um

00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
um
i

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
i think our
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
advice would be not to
 
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.910 align:start position:0%
advice would be not to
change

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
the bill further beyond adding
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question up i
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
guess my question am i understanding
 
00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
guess my question am i understanding
from

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
from the scheme of this that
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
if let's say let's say comcast
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
decides that it's going to build in
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
particular you know build out in some
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
particular area if if you make that
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
determination to do that and you get all
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
the regulatory approvals and all the
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
other things you need
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
do you get some
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term some monopoly
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
protection in the sense that somebody
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
else is sort of prohibited from building
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
out we do not you don't get any
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
at any level either from the poc or the
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
municipality right so the the 1996
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
telecommunications act
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
successor to the 34 communications act
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
is very clear
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
about how it treats these issues there's
 
00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:07.270 align:start position:0%
about how it treats these issues there's
no

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
for a cable company there's no uh
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
exclusivity any permitting that we
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
receive from any community which there
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
was mention of a franchise it's called a
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
franchise in the industry they're not
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
exclusive state law similarly was
 
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.150 align:start position:0%
exclusive state law similarly was
amended

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the late 90s following the 96 act say
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace constraint or any monopoly
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
authority inferred in any way at any
 
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.589 align:start position:0%
authority inferred in any way at any
level

00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you madam
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
chair um could you say again how many
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
households are not served currently in
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
a reasonable estimate is between 25
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
and 30 000 households
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
call them locations
 
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.990 align:start position:0%
call them locations
because

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
year-round residences
 
00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.230 align:start position:0%
year-round residences
but

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
call it 25 or 30 000
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you um
 
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.910 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you um
and

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
based on maybe
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
past uh knowledge or
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
data out of those 25 to 30 000 how many
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
of those would actually
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
subscribe to service if offered yeah
 
00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.349 align:start position:0%
subscribe to service if offered yeah
so

00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh penetration varies to some degree
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
based on socioeconomic factors but in
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
general uh in new hampshire
 
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.230 align:start position:0%
general uh in new hampshire
75

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
75
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
maybe 80
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
to a wired solution right i want to be i
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
want to make that i want to distinguish
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
in that way so
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
cell phone
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
penetration in the state is virtually
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous at this point it's
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
i think in the low 90s
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
but the market penetration for a wired
 
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.950 align:start position:0%
but the market penetration for a wired
solution

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
is in the
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
nearly 80 percent
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to think that this
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.950 align:start position:0%
would be
different

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
for these areas yes representative thank
 
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned the socio
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic factors
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
underserved right now the 25 to 30 000
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
would that
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
a smaller percentage of those households
 
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.349 align:start position:0%
a smaller percentage of those households
might

00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
be interested in signing up or would
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
that still be 75 percent i think it's
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's not enough variation there to
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
change that top line number when you
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
look at the whole state so what we know
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
from a lot of great research that pew
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
has done in other
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
organizations is that adoption
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
is a larger problem than availability
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
and this bill fixes hopes seeks to fix
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
the availability issue right
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
make it act accessible to people if they
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
want it
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
the other issue here is adoption and
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
adoption is
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
a complicated set of issues has to do
 
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.750 align:start position:0%
a complicated set of issues has to do
with

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know cost of service access to
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
hardware it has to do with
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh demographic issues older populations
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
tend to adopt to a lesser degree than a
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
younger population it's it's a
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
multi-factored issue
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
the but
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason to think that 80
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
percent high 70s
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know would not be the case across
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and um i will call
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%

just a little bit of background first
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
and foremost we are in support of the

and foremost we are in support of the
bill

bill
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
for those who aren't quite as familiar
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
with the co-op we are an electric
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
distribution company we serve 85 000
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
members across 118 communities
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
throughout new hampshire
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
with electric service
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
back in 2020
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
we formed a broadband subsidiary new
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire broadband to address a lot of
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
the issues that were discussed today for
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
our members to make sure that our
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
members our electric members had access
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
to high-quality reliable high-speed
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
internet service
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
that was a serious need that certainly
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
the pandemic helped to bring to the
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
surface in many ways
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
we've taken a number of steps to address
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
the issues of broadband
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
limited broadband access
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
we applied for and were successful in
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
getting cares funding in 2020.
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
with that funding we were able to
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
connect 1100 previously unserved
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
households and businesses in colebrook
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
stewart's town clarksville and leemster
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
we're currently expanding to provide
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
service to
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
the communities of acworth and sandwich
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
which will make
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet available to another
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
1800 uh
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
locations in those communities and we
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
just recently announced a major
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
expansion into grafton county that will
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
provide service to co-op members uh in
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
32 towns
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
and we estimate that's around uh 17 000
 
00:46:38.079 --> 00:46:39.589 align:start position:0%
and we estimate that's around uh 17 000
locations

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:46:39.599 --> 00:46:40.470 align:start position:0%
locations
so

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of activity and um certainly the
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
availability of uh federal funding and
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
support is critical for our efforts as
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
they were with cares uh mr hodgson
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the art off auction that the
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
fcc ran we were a participant in that
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
and we did uh receive funding to build
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
out uh 70
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
census block areas throughout the state
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
with high-speed internet
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
so critical issue there's a lot of work
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh we are supportive of the bill and i
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
just want to highlight two critical
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
areas uh of support one is uh the
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility that the bill would provide
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
the bea to administer the funds uh there
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
is as was previously discussed by
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey a lot of federal
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
funding that is coming in through the
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and arpa
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
bills that were passed there is the
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 85 process that this is
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
largely aimed at making um
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
changes to but flexibility on on how
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
those funds can be used and applied in
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
different ways so it's not a one size
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
fits all
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
and then the second is
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility on compliance with the
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
federal requirements of the different
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities so uh the arpa
 
00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities so uh the arpa
fund

00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
has sort of different rules to it than
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure fund and uh at the
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
very last page of the bill it provides
 
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility that the
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
federal guidance and the federal
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
requirements are sort of the prevailing
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
issues so if the state rules are in
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
conflict with the federal rules it gives
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the federal rules to um
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
to be utilized
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
with that i'd be happy to answer any
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
some of us actually voted on that
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
to let the co-op
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
do broadband it it
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
makes so much sense that you already
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
have the polls
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay yes uh representative petrie oh
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question now are you
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
controlled by the puc
 
00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:52.710 align:start position:0%
controlled by the puc
currently

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
so we are uh not rate regulated by the
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission so the puc
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
exists to balance the interest of
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
shareholders and customers
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're a non-profit we're owned by our
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
members so there isn't that balancing
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
there are certain areas where we are
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
still regulated by the puc energy
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency and sort of customer um
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
disconnections and payment arrangements
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh but by and large we are governed by
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
our uh democratically elected board of
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
directors thank you
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
by the way we like it that way
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much oh did you have a
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
question representative leishman sorry
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
no no problem madam chair thanks
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
so the previous uh
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
question i had concerning the build out
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
into areas that already had uh say
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
comcast service in those federal funds
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
that you obtained did you build into
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
areas that
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
already had service or was completely
 
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.349 align:start position:0%
already had service or was completely
unserviced

00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
unserviced
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
so they are unserved
 
00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
most of the federal funding does not
 
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.349 align:start position:0%
most of the federal funding does not
allow

00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
the federal funding that we have
 
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
the federal funding that we have
previously

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
accessed so the cares funding as well as
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
the ardoff funding
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
it was specifically for areas identified
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
by the federal government through the
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
fcc maps that do not have service thanks
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
thanks venom chair
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
further yes representative heath
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is um with regard
 
00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.549 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is um with regard
to

00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
the social economic
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
group of people that are unable
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
financially to access
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
is there and i don't know very much
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
about all of this is there a priority
 
00:50:38.829 --> 00:50:38.839 align:start position:0%
for you for comcast for
 
00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
whomever um to make
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
some kind of um
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
scholarships or some kind of funding
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
available to those individuals i mean it
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
is costly i mean i know how much i pay a
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
month for my service and i'm sure that
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
there are many many families that can't
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
afford to pay what the cost is so how is
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
that handled and is that any part of the
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
federal requirements
 
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.349 align:start position:0%
federal requirements
so

00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so i'll address that in two ways
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
the the first is yes affordability is a
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
part of the criteria that the federal
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
government has uh identified
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
specifically um
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to be weighed uh in addition
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
to making funding available for capital
 
00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:23.349 align:start position:0%
to making funding available for capital
construction

00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government has also made a
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
affordability program available to help
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
offset the monthly cost of programs
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
as the electric co-op we're not for
 
00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.630 align:start position:0%
as the electric co-op we're not for
profit

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
affordability is absolutely something
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
critical and important to us and in the
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
center of of why we're doing this so you
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
know we talk about ensuring access
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
affordability and reliability
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
affordability is is a key area for us as
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
well and when we structure our broadband
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
plans um
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
we really do try to to keep that in mind
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
so uh in addition to
 
00:52:02.319 --> 00:52:03.349 align:start position:0%
so uh in addition to
um

00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know the federal funding uh making
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure we're we're operating essentially
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative walsh
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
just a quick question i know comcast has
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
a program that's i think ten dollars a
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
month for low income do you offer the
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
same program
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
we don't at this time but we are
 
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.790 align:start position:0%
we don't at this time but we are
actively

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
actively
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
working on rolling out a uh exploring a
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
low income program and as i said there
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
is the federal affordability program
 
00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.309 align:start position:0%
is the federal affordability program
that

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
customers who would take advantage of
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
that would be paying essentially 10 a
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
that our department of homeland security

in cheshire and sullivan counties
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
these two disasters were the result of
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
significant rainfall that occurred in
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
two separate storms in july
 
00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.750 align:start position:0%
two separate storms in july
and

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
impacted 21 different

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated process
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
working through fema
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm still learning about it
 
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.829 align:start position:0%
i'm still learning about it
and

00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
but the impact on these towns 21 towns
 
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.270 align:start position:0%
but the impact on these towns 21 towns
uh

00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
it was significant uh
 
00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
it was significant uh
waterways

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
waterways
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't know political boundaries uh the
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
most significant damage is in
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
towns outside of
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
my district i should have introduced
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
myself i'm j khan from keene represent
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
15 of 23 towns in cheshire county
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
but what was apparent here is that
 
00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:22.150 align:start position:0%
but what was apparent here is that
uh

00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
the storm affected a number of
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
communities and
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
how the state
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
participates in the process of recovery
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh ought to be a consistent approach not
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
by political
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
influence to have my project be superior
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
to your needs
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
but that the state have a consistent
 
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.230 align:start position:0%
but that the state have a consistent
approach

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
if one goes back and looks at history
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
from 2005 to 2007 when the series of
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
disasters were declared in cheshire
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
it was in the town of alstead and
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
probably people recalled the cold river
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh wiping out a bridge uh
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
carrying away uh
 
00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.670 align:start position:0%
carrying away uh
roadways

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
it was a significant disaster and i had
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
and it took years to settle this out uh
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank goodness the state participated
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the match process and so the match
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
process traditionally
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
is a 75 federal
 
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.150 align:start position:0%
is a 75 federal
uh

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.829 align:start position:0%
uh
appropriation

00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
through fema
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
in disaster recovery
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
25 percent
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
that requires a local match local match
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
could be from state or local funds
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
in that instance
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
with the alstead flood
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
took several years to to understand what
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
the total cost of the projects and
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
recovery would be
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
and then matched the amounts
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's a legislative history on that
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
that dates to 2009
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
so that the floods that occurred in 2006
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
and 2007
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
where finally the state
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
covered the 25 match
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh that's what essentially is being
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
sought here
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh initially it was with the idea that
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
if it was 75 and a 25 percent local that
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
the local would be matched in two parts
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
12 and a half percent from the state
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
12 and a half percent from the
 
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.349 align:start position:0%
12 and a half percent from the
communities

00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and why would that be necessary
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
some of these are small towns even if
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
it's a larger community like keene
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
these are not budgeted disasters and
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
nobody's carrying a surplus for a
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
disaster uh and
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the case of alstead uh if there was
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh 20 million dollars of damage for
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
instance uh 25 of that cost could you
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
know wipe out their budget
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh in any given year so
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh probably the top end of of what this
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
disaster entails
 
00:58:14.799 --> 00:58:15.829 align:start position:0%
disaster entails
uh

00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then smaller amounts in a variety of
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
other communities that vary in size
 
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.309 align:start position:0%
other communities that vary in size
but

00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
cover communities like walpole and
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
keane and troy and winchester and
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
something that's happened in between
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
here is that the federal government has
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh notified our uh emergency management
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
department that
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
they will match this storm this incident
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
with a 90 10 match
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
so now we've got a 10 percent match
 
00:59:01.119 --> 00:59:03.670 align:start position:0%
so now we've got a 10 percent match
problem

00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
and in my proposal to the senate uh it
 
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.630 align:start position:0%
and in my proposal to the senate uh it
was

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh how do we how do we quantify this so
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
i took stabs at trying to well i think
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
it'll cost this or i think it'll
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
there was no way to put a boundary on
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that president uh senate
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.549 --> 00:59:32.559 align:start position:0%
proposed this amendment
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what you have in front of you
 
00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.750 align:start position:0%
and that's what you have in front of you
today

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
the way that i interpret the amendment
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
is that it is trying to provide a
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
shortcut process
 
00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.390 align:start position:0%
shortcut process
for

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
the state to participate in the match
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
match is not determined by this language
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
but there is the intent for that match
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
to come forward
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
fema is currently in the process of
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
doing the evaluation on these in these
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
21 towns for
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
29 different applications
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
but the dollar amounts still aren't
 
01:00:16.319 --> 01:00:17.190 align:start position:0%
but the dollar amounts still aren't
known

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
known
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
and may not be known until the projects
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
here with us today is jen harper from
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
emergency management homeland security
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
she can get much further into the
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
details of how this is going to get
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
rustled to the ground
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
but the intent here is to provide a
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
shortcut process so that
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
these requests can come through the
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
governor to the fiscal committee
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
to the executive council and towns can
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
recoup the dollars
 
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:54.870 align:start position:0%
recoup the dollars
that

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
and restore stability to their local
 
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.630 align:start position:0%
and restore stability to their local
treasuries

01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
treasuries
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's the intent
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
and i hope and i have to say this i hope
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
that we will
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
try to establish a fairness principle
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
that regardless of the dollar amount
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
regardless of the size of the town
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
that the towns who face disasters know
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to be there for
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
them to a certain extent
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll need to define that certain
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
extent whether that's fifty percent or a
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
hundred percent as it was in alstead
 
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:29.750 align:start position:0%
hundred percent as it was in alstead
uh

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
what what that amount is
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate the committee uh
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh taking this under consideration and
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative emerick
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh senator
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh last week we heard uh uh
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
had a public hearing on senate bill 409
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
is this complementary to that or
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
because i don't i haven't read all the
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
details of 409 but this seems to be the
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
same kind of thing
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
and thank you for bringing that up
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
409 establishes a
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
a ready loan
 
01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.789 align:start position:0%
a ready loan
provision

01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
towns may not be able to wait the three
 
01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:21.750 align:start position:0%
towns may not be able to wait the three
years

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
for fema approval
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
for contracts to be
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
to go through the purchasing process to
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
collect the receipts etc
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
it sets up an arrangement where through
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
the state's treasury there can be a zero
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
interest loan
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
to the town to complete the work
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
solve the in immediate emergency that
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
the town faces
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
the town is
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
then on the hook
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
for repaying that amount to the state
 
01:02:55.359 --> 01:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
for repaying that amount to the state
treasury

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
as fema dollars would come in those
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
dollars would
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
pay down
 
01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:02.390 align:start position:0%
pay down
the

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
debt obligation to the state treasurer
 
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.270 align:start position:0%
debt obligation to the state treasurer
and

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:07.570 align:start position:0%
and
then

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:07.580 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.870 align:start position:0%
then
[Music]

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
this

01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
would indicate will the state through
 
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
would indicate will the state through
its

01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
fund availability provide some match
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
to further pay down
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
like chairman
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
division one chair emerick i've been
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out i've been
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
sitting here flipping back and forth
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
between the two bills
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out how they play
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
on each other so under
 
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
the one we heard last week which is
 
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
the one we heard last week which is
409.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
409.
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
um they've got a payback they're
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
probably 12 percent the town does
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
under your bill this is it the idea the
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
state would pay that 12 so that the
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
local communities would be off the hook
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
for their share of what it cost to
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
yes let me clarify the
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
you're on you've got the right idea just
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
i'll try to tighten up on the numbers
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
in this instance fema has indicated that
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
they'll reimburse 90 percent
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
there's a ten percent town obligation so
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh the town of alstead we'll just keep
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
using them uh i don't think
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative aarons will mind
 
01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.789 align:start position:0%
representative aarons will mind
that

01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
if

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
they had
 
01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.390 align:start position:0%
they had
the

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
disaster and they wanted to
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
initiate the work immediately
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
they would go to the state treasury draw
 
01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.710 align:start position:0%
they would go to the state treasury draw
down

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
they would they would
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
ask for a loan from the treasurer under
 
01:04:51.039 --> 01:04:52.710 align:start position:0%
ask for a loan from the treasurer under
409

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
409
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
for five million dollars worth of work
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
they would complete that work
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
and probably along the way find out
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
from fema
 
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.470 align:start position:0%
from fema
that

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
they would reimburse
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
up to 4.5 million dollars depending on
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
is that what the total cost of the
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
project is
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
but let's just say the project cost and
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
the estimate and the drawdown were all
 
01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:19.510 align:start position:0%
the estimate and the drawdown were all
the

01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
same amount
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
so 4.5 million dollars would ultimately
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
be paid or reimbursed to the town
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
that four and a half million dollars
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
would go directly from alstead to the
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
state treasury to pay down the 5 million
 
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
loan now we've got 500 000
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
hanging out there
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
of that 500 000
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
the intent of the original legislation
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
was that 50 percent of that two hundred
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars would be paid by
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
the town in two hundred fifty thousand
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
dollars by the state
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
this language here doesn't indicate that
 
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.309 align:start position:0%
this language here doesn't indicate that
share

01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
this language here says
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
but the state might pay the whole
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
so there's no share in here
 
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
so there's no share in here
uh

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
that was the original intent that i
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.510 align:start position:0%
brought forward
but

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't clarify that
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
and and perhaps the committee would want
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
to do that on the other hand
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh precedent was set in 2009
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the alstead floods of 2007
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh at 100
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
of what the town's obligation was so
 
01:06:33.039 --> 01:06:34.870 align:start position:0%
of what the town's obligation was so
uh

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
but the state
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
the state as a participant in these
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
disasters and you know why is this
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
important to to try to wrestle in this
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislative legislative session because
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
having some
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
process and understanding in the towns
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
as to how
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
these emergencies are going to be
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
is is something that can come away from
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you madam
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for the question would it
 
01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:17.670 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for the question would it
be

01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
would i be correct in simplifying the
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
difference between 409 and
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh this bill here that the difference is
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
one is a grant and one is a loan yes
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative lynn so i'm wondering um
 
01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:34.789 align:start position:0%
representative lynn so i'm wondering um
is

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
we heard in connection with 409
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
that there's
that

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
the reason that that that needed to be
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
structured as loans is that if it wasn't
 
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.670 align:start position:0%
structured as loans is that if it wasn't
alone

01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government would say that
 
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
the federal government would say that
that's

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
that um you know that's you've already
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
gotten this money and so i'm just kind
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
of wondering if this is a grant do we
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
problem that the federal government is
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
going to say well you're not eligible
 
01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:02.950 align:start position:0%
going to say well you're not eligible
for

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
whatever the amount of the government
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's a question for um
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
homeland security when and they're going
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
to testify here shortly so okay
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine sure you'll know
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
whether you might have had an answer if
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
you hold that question i would prefer
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
that sure okay homeland security answer
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
that that's fine
 
01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%
that that's fine
thank

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.789 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
do you imagine
 
01:08:35.430 --> 01:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass that each
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
budget would have a direct appropriation
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
into some sort of a trust fund to be
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
ready to do this or or would this should
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
this be set up to just be a draw down on
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
any rainy day surplus how how would you
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
that that too might be a best question
 
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
that that too might be a best question
to

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
homeland security uh emergency
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
management because uh
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately they need to be the
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
administrator uh of this and i would
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
envision that they would be the uh arm
 
01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
of state government that would
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
bring those recommendations forward to
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
the governor uh
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
and and the process would then take off
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
from there and and hopefully they would
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
be aligned in some proximate time
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature would see its full
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
exposure from a declared disaster
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
as opposed to seeing 21 separate
 
01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
as opposed to seeing 21 separate
requests

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions for
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
representative irv
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify for me
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
how this
 
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.189 align:start position:0%
how this
limits

01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
limits
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
the amount the governor can draw to the
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
amount that fema is not picking up
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me to just being
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
open-ended the governor can
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
can uh approp to as authorized to draw
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
whatever money he wants for the
 
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:18.390 align:start position:0%
whatever money he wants for the
municipalities

01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
i i agree that i don't see that this
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
puts a boundary on it except that it's
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay but you agree that that's not even
 
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
okay but you agree that that's not even
stated

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.750 align:start position:0%
stated
yeah

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
okay are there further questions
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you senator khan we're

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.669 align:start position:0%
acworth goshen langdon lobster and
washington

01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
so i've been here before
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
and you've all heard my story so i'm not
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
going to repeat it again
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
and i did prepare some comments
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
um which
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to
 
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh read verbatim
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
um i just came here today
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
to ask that
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
you pass
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
this bill sb-402
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill and i think it's
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.590 align:start position:0%
it's an important bill and i think it's
got

01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
got
um

01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's much better than when it was
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
first proposed because it is
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
it has turned into
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
what i had hoped
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.750 align:start position:0%
would be
[Music]

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
the most useful
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
for our municipalities that
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
have incurred
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
damage from these natural disasters and
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
that is all along as i've been asking
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
the state and talking to various people
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
about the needs
 
01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
about the needs
of

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
my municipality acworth in particular
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
after the july 29 flood
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
and asking for some financial help for
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
our town
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
i was constantly being told that there's
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
no statutory mechanism to get money to
 
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.310 align:start position:0%
no statutory mechanism to get money to
towns

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
who are in need
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
and this bill does that
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
because it's it's fairly open-ended it
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
is a grant
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
from the state to help a town
 
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're having
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
as we're wrestling with sb 402 sb 409
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
and even the bill that i proposed in the
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
house which would have set up a
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
municipal disaster relief fund at the
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the problems that we've run into with
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
if it's not alone
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from fema that they
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give you the amount of money
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.590 align:start position:0%
that you need
to

01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
counter

01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
counter
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
sort of put on the side with also the
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
issue of towns needing to do work
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
right away
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
after a disaster happens in order to get
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
them back online and make streets safe
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
and make
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
roads passable for emts and emergency
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles and so forth
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we have this situation where
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
towns need help immediately or even
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
later on after
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
fema does reimburse funds but don't
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't reimburse the entire amount or
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
maybe doesn't reimburse them at all
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
because maybe there's a problem with the
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
way in which the product project was
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
done in the first place
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
the town needs money
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
they could use it in the form of a grant
 
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.310 align:start position:0%
they could use it in the form of a grant
or

01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
the town could take a loan and
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
pay somehow figure out how to pay that
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
back in the end
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is that towns are dealing
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the bureaucracy of a federal
 
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.030 align:start position:0%
with the bureaucracy of a federal
government

01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:35.830 align:start position:0%
government
where

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
you submit a project
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
to fema
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
the town has to lay out that money first
 
01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
in the beginning to do the project
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
and then the reimbursement comes later
 
01:14:53.189 --> 01:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
from fema if the project is approved
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
and if fema decides fema decides how
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
much they're going to reimburse or not
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh represent aaron could you please
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
stick to the topic yet so so
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
the topic is that this particular bill
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
allows for monies to be given to
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
towns that need it
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
either in the beginning
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the process where they might need
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
funds immediately
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
or later on
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
after the project is finished
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
and money has come back from fema but
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
not the entire amount so that the town
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
can still
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
have access to some funds from the state
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for a statutory
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism for the state to give money to
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
a town that needs it after a natural
 
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.390 align:start position:0%
a town that needs it after a natural
disaster

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.270 align:start position:0%
disaster
and

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
i you know i think that that that's an
 
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.950 align:start position:0%
i you know i think that that that's an
important

01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:46.709 align:start position:0%
important
um

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
an important aspect
 
01:15:48.719 --> 01:15:49.669 align:start position:0%
an important aspect
is

01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
the town needs the the the state really
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
should have a mechanism whereby they can
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
help the towns in the in these
 
01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.669 align:start position:0%
help the towns in the in these
situations

01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there uh
 
01:16:01.679 --> 01:16:04.149 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there uh
questions

from the homeland
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%

just as eloquently
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
questions at this point
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
that people may have or
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
did you have anything you wanted to say
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
no and i just
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine no no okay yeah now
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
represent lynn you may ask your question
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
so the the question it's really the same
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
question that i asked for senator khan
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
is if this
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
if this bill as opposed to 409 is a this
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill is a grant whereas 409 was talking
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
about alone
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
is there some danger
 
01:17:46.159 --> 01:17:47.510 align:start position:0%
is there some danger
that

01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
if money is is distributed to a
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
municipality under the authority that
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
would be granted by this bill
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
that fema would then say well you have
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality has no obligation to
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
pay it back
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's not you know it we can't
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
we can't reimburse you federal money
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh for this
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
grant so let me start and then
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
would be a grant at the end of the
 
01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.470 align:start position:0%
would be a grant at the end of the
project

01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
period i think
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
there may be some discussion that needs
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
to happen in a work session or something
 
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
to happen in a work session or something
but

01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
as senator khan was mentioning um
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
the communities would get reimbursed
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
from fema for a project so let's just
 
01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
from fema for a project so let's just
say

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
the town of jen had a disaster and their
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
25 streets were just were
 
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.350 align:start position:0%
25 streets were just were
damaged

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
damaged
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
the town of jen works with vanessa's
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
group and fema they write up the
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
projects for the 25 roads
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
and submit them
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
as they're
 
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
worked on so there's two pieces
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's a small project and a large
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
project small projects are up to
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
depends on the disaster but it's around
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
three grand and change so three thousand
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
dollars so if it's a small little area
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars fema will will
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
obligate the money give the money to the
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
community fix the road have a nice day
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
if it cost them twenty five hundred
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
dollars they get to keep the five
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
oh yeah please clarify this is why she's
 
01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:29.590 align:start position:0%
oh yeah please clarify this is why she's
here

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um so sorry to clarify fema
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
has multiple different lanes of projects
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are small projects and large
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
projects the small project and large
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
project thresholds change on a annual
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
basis based on the federal government
 
01:19:44.709 --> 01:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
every federal fiscal year so the small
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
project threshold is the minimum a
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
project must be in order to be eligible
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
for fema and that hovers around three
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
grand every year the large project
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
threshold hovers around 130 grand each
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
year so if it is 130 grand or over it's
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
considered a large project and it's
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursed to the penny for eligible
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
work small projects that fall between
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
the 3 grand and 130 grand
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
variable numbers
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
are considered small projects those can
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed if the work is done or if
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
the work needs to be completed
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
so they can be completed on actuals or
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
on an estimate if the um for example if
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's done on an estimate and the
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
community comes in under budget they can
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
keep the remaining money and do whatever
 
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
they want with it if it comes in over
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
bonded budget then that's the risk that
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
they take on in doing a small project so
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between the two
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess where i was going was
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
for those larger small projects are sort
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
of easy those larger projects
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
in chatting with senator khan and
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative aaron um
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
it could take
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
years for 25 roads to be fixed
 
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:55.590 align:start position:0%
years for 25 roads to be fixed
and

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
where does this come in so fema would
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
say two years from now they finish main
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
street in the town of jen and they
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
submit all their receipts they get
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
and fema would pay ninety percent of
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
that that ten percent is what this would
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
cover so the hundred thousand dollars
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
the town of gen could come to the
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
governor and say hey
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have the money to cover this 10
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
percent can we get a grant from the
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
state to cover the hundred thousand
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
dollars because our town can't absorb
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
that 10
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
so that would be where this would be a
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
grant and that's fine because fema's
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
already paid the 90
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i think a grant in this case
 
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.310 align:start position:0%
so i think a grant in this case
works

01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
right yep um
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
so i will say um it's a good question
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
about duplication and benefits i believe
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's where your question stems from
 
01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:50.790 align:start position:0%
that's where your question stems from
correct

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
um and so it's definitely something to
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
consider um i think that
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
this being the 10 that fema's not
 
01:22:01.199 --> 01:22:02.390 align:start position:0%
this being the 10 that fema's not
covering

01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
covering
 
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.189 align:start position:0%
covering
um

01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
it may be worth looking at the language
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
just to ensure that there's no way that
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
fema could consider this to be a
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
duplication of benefits meaning if we
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
were to potentially consider
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
or somebody were to
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me potentially consider adding
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
language such as this money where we
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
would excuse me would be used for
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
the non-federal share or for things that
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
were not eligible under federal funding
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
so for example the non-federal share
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
match which is what the town contributes
 
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
to 10 is not eligible for fema
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement therefore it could not be
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
a duplication of benefits additionally
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
work that was not eligible under fema's
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
program could also not be a duplication
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
of benefits
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
you look like you have a follow-up well
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
no i'm just wondering i mean do you
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
you don't happen to have any sort of
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
suggested language that you think might
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
except perhaps
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
sorry except perhaps to say
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps something like
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
this funding could be used on things
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that are not eligible for on items that
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for federal
 
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for federal
reimbursement

01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
something broad that could cover both
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
categories including non-federal match
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
and things that are deemed not eligible
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
under fema's programs
 
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
under fema's programs
okay

01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
oh my heavens
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative hatch i'll go around this
 
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.310 align:start position:0%
representative hatch i'll go around this
way

01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
oh you didn't have your hand up i did
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
but he was handed up first
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative leitchman thank you madam
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks representative hatch
 
01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks representative hatch
so

01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a little curious you didn't take a
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
position on the bill
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
or didn't provide any testimony so
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
am i to assume and i never like to
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
you're not comfortable with the bill
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
unless there's new language to try to
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
clear up
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps some
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
double funding that this might create or
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm not opposed to this i just want
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's on the same page and
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
understands the interpretation of it so
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's my only hesitancy so i
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
knew i didn't know but i figured that
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
there would be a number of questions
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
that would come up today
 
01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.950 align:start position:0%
that would come up today
so

01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're correct in saying that i did not
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
take a stand on it
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to take a stand on it
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
and then have a bunch of questions come
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
up and me looking like a deer in the
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
headlight going oh we hadn't thought
 
01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
about that so
 
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
about that so
um

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the questions that
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative lin had and some of the
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
questions that you all asked
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative khan because vanessa and
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
i were both copiously taking notes and
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's really important
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we get this right the first time so
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
that when
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
if a town if this passes then a town
 
01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.350 align:start position:0%
if a town if this passes then a town
submits

01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
submits
 
01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
for 10
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
that they
are

01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
clearly know the expectation of what
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to get or what they're not
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.590 align:start position:0%
going to get
thanks

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative patch thank you madam
 
01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:29.750 align:start position:0%
representative patch thank you madam
chair

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
in addition to that but the statement
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
that needs to be added to this bill for
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
clarity um stating that for items not
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's a disaster a town needs money
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
immediately and i'm not so sure
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
the needs are delineated between what's
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
a federal
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
um approved grant would be approved
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
under a federal grant and what is it so
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
how would that work just
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
if you do you follow my question i'm not
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
sure i'm clear on that if and thank you
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair okay
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
um i think if i have followed today
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
correctly and the intent of the bill
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the bill is to cover
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
the portion of the expense that fema
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
will not cover which is likely to be
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
things that are ineligible or
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
potentially um up to the 10 match for
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
these two disasters that occurred in
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
2021 in cheshire and sullivan counties
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah okay
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i think in that case um
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
you know we have two bills that are at
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
work here 409 and 402. it sounds like
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
409 is the one that's intended to be the
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
one that's more expeditious of the two
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
provides that immediate relief as the
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
name suggests expedited
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
loan whereas this is to come in and help
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
make the community whole after fema's
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement has kicked in
 
01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.149 align:start position:0%
reimbursement has kicked in
yeah

01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to be clear thank you
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um is there any
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
way that fema could try and if if we pay
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
the 10 federal match out of state funds
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
does fema have a mechanism to try and
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
claw back that money then
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
do they have that would they do they do
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
audits or something where they might
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
come back and try and claim that money
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
or claim that
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
that you know the town wasn't
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
doing this in good faith
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
if i understand your question correctly
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but they've
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
already said that a town were paying the
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
90 of eligible expenses what they are
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
not paying
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
is things that are ineligible already
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
so yes they do audits but
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
we're paying that 10
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
the state is
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to pay that 10 to the community in
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
the form of a grant fema's not correct
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong it's going to be able to
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's not federal money it would be state
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
money that's paying the town so fema
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
can't come back and say hey
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
you did something wrong when they
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
already made a determination that
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're paying 90 percent of fixing main
 
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.430 align:start position:0%
they're paying 90 percent of fixing main
street

01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
street
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
i guess follow-up
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
yes please my concern comes from
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
my lack of knowing federal fema law and
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
does the federal law say that the local
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
community has to pay that 10
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
or is it just not fema pays the 10
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
percent it's not fema that pays the 10
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
percent they don't care the federal
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
government says have a nice day we're
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
paying you 90
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
here it is
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
what how they get that 10
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
if they get that 10
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
they can either do it themselves as the
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
town or the state can pay it or
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know i guess a pr a private entity
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
could pay it but it's not it can't come
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
from other federal grant
 
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.669 align:start position:0%
from other federal grant
monies

01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
monies
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
that alleviates my concern thank you
 
01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.790 align:start position:0%
that alleviates my concern thank you
okay

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank thank you madam chair um
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
under the assumption that this bill
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
passes just to set the context
 
01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.070 align:start position:0%
passes just to set the context
uh

01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
we're 12 months away from having this do
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
our next two year budget
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
how much would you request in the budget
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
for this in each of those two years and
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
and assuming you don't know that answer
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
could you describe the methodology that
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
you might use to come upon a budget
 
01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
you might use to come upon a budget
number

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
so i think that was the original issue
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
with this that
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
the collective we
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
could not come up with a number to put
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the budget which is how we got to
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
this language if i'm not mistaken
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes senator khan is shaking his head yes
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
so we
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
all the smart people
 
01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.149 align:start position:0%
all the smart people
including

01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
vanessa and fallon
 
01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
vanessa and fallon
um

01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's no way to know for cheshire and
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
sullivan county what that 10 percent is
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
going to be six years from now
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to put in to the 2425 budget
 
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:56.470 align:start position:0%
to be able to put in to the 2425 budget
that

01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
10 million or 2 million or
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
50 million
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
which is why we did this now it would be
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
the community would come after the main
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
street project was done two years later
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
alstead comes to the table and says hey
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
we got our 90 percent from fema the
 
01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
project is closed out we need a million
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
follow it uh all right i i think i
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
understand that um
 
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.430 align:start position:0%
understand that um
so

01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:31.510 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
the need is expressed by representative
 
01:30:37.110 --> 01:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
aaron is uh fast cash now
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
they that the towns need the money right
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
away what you've described is a a look
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
back process once we know what fema's
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
gonna reimburse and all
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
um so there seems to be a difference in
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
purposes there that
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to understand a little bit
 
01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.229 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to understand a little bit
better

01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
um what
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
how how do we how do we meet
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative aaron's stated need
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
under this law i'm not seeing any
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
language even in here to talk about the
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
timing of when the payments are made
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's absent whether or not it's up
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
front or after the fact so we at least
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
would need to clarify that in the
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
language i think
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i think that
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
based on what we've heard from
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative aaron you know there are
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
kind of two needs that these communities
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
have you know the first is definitely as
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
you said fast cash now um to help
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
alleviate the immediate burden but the
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
other half of this conversation is the
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
long-term needs of these communities and
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
their economic viability so
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
being able to make them whole at the end
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
is going to put them in a position where
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know they are ready for that next
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
disaster or can at least keep their
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
current budgets running so i think
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's why there are two different bills
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
at play here
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to the timing of
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um that's definitely still
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
a discussion that's open you know we
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
were trying to decide do we do this on a
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
project by project basis do we wait
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
until the end of the disaster um that
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
would still have to be sorted out
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
but there's some flexibility there
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.550 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
yes

01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
represent murray
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair can we go back to
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
what eligible and non-eligible means
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
fema will cover ninety percent of
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
eligible projects
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
um a hundred ninety percent of one
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
hundred percent eligible projects when
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
you were saying well this other money
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
could be used for ill uneligible
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
non-eligible ineligible ineligible
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
projects um
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict here that i don't
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
understand is it's not fema doesn't
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
cover 90 percent of eligible and
 
01:32:52.159 --> 01:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
cover 90 percent of eligible and
illegible

01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
illegible
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
ineligible projects all at the same time
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
those are two different things so it
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me or it could it seems
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
to me that there would be a project a
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
problem to say well the
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
ineligible projects could be used for
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
this other 10 because it's that 10
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
percent is based on 100 percent eligible
 
01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:12.390 align:start position:0%
percent is based on 100 percent eligible
projects

01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
so can you address just there there's a
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
conflict here i don't understand that i
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
think we would need to understand if we
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
need to straighten out this language
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
to make clear
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
that this 10
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
isn't impacted and doesn't come back to
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
bite the communities afterwards does
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
that make sense the difference between
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
the two words i think so yeah so i think
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the easiest way
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
and keeping in mind that fema's public
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
assistance program is
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
has so much depth there's a lot to it
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
but if you look at it holistically
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
expenses that a community has
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
post-disaster are kind of divided into
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
two parts those that are eligible under
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
fema pa and those that are not eligible
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
or are ineligible under pa
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
so in this case 100 of expenses that are
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
deemed eligible in fema's program of
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
that 100 percent 90 would be reimbursed
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
by fema for these disasters and the
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
other 10 would hopefully be covered by
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
this bill anything that is ineligible
 
01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
consider it a completely separate number
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's not tied to the 10 percent that
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're discussing today
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah if i could
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
let me just try to give a very simple
 
01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:21.030 align:start position:0%
let me just try to give a very simple
example

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
example
um

01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:25.110 --> 01:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
let's say the main street is the problem
 
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.470 align:start position:0%
let's say the main street is the problem
okay

01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
and then you have a feeder street in
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
that wasn't damaged but you think that
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
you need to fix
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
the culvert on the feeder street
 
01:34:38.159 --> 01:34:39.189 align:start position:0%
the culvert on the feeder street
okay

01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
well fema doesn't think you need to fix
 
01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:42.870 align:start position:0%
well fema doesn't think you need to fix
that

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
and so that
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
if you fixed it it would be ineligible
 
01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
if you fixed it it would be ineligible
okay

01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:49.830 align:start position:0%
okay
but

01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
kind of the easiest way to try to
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
explain some of that ineligible stuff
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
that we'll talk about this afternoon i
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
could we wouldn't be able to include
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
that or that that would not be able to
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
be included in the ten percent that's
 
01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:05.669 align:start position:0%
be included in the ten percent that's
correct

01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay are there
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative lin
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes i i guess the one question i have is
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a follow-up to representative
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
edward's question is this if if it it
 
01:35:21.109 --> 01:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
seems like what we're talking about is
 
01:35:21.119 --> 01:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
seems like what we're talking about is
that

01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
monies that would be dispersed by
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
the governor under this bill would not
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
be happening quickly it would be sort of
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so if it's at the end of the process
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
and you were you were both using the
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
term two years as an example but even if
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
it was only one year
 
01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:41.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just wondering what
 
01:35:41.679 --> 01:35:42.629 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just wondering what
why

01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
why is it
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
why does it make sense to allow that
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
decision to be made by the governor the
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
executive council and the fiscal
 
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
committee only as opposed to the full
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislature when presumably even if it
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
was a year or or certainly if it was two
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
years the legislature would be back in
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
session and could have then the full
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
legislature could approach could
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
consider the matter and appropriate the
 
01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.790 align:start position:0%
consider the matter and appropriate the
money

01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
man i think i can speak to the program
 
01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:13.109 align:start position:0%
man i think i can speak to the program
okay

01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:13.119 --> 01:36:14.229 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
so programmatically speaking for fema's
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
pa process there are multiple points in
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
its decision-making process where things
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
might be determined to be ineligible for
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
example so we've kind of been talking
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
about two different
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
things that this bill could fund
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
ineligible expenses and the 10
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
the ineligible expenses are likely to
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
fall out of that process sooner so
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of on a rolling basis and
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
that could happen at any time within the
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
process but likely a lot of them are
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
identified closer to the beginning of
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
the process and fewer as you move on
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and the reasons for ineligibility can
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
vary it could just be the facility but
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
it could also be as representative
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
aarons noted
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know the way that the process was
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
done maybe a community didn't follow all
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the rules within fema's program for
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
example and that could lead to
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
ineligibility down the line but that's
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a rolling basis the other part
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
of what this bill would fund which is
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
the 10
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
is determined more at the end of the
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
process it will be sooner for small
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
projects and a longer process for large
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
projects due to their relative
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
complexities within the program does
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
that help answer your question
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
you are there any further questions
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to seeing you this
 
01:37:24.719 --> 01:37:25.910 align:start position:0%

oh

01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that signed in on the
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh margaret burns from nhma is in favor
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
of this other than that the other
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
folks have testified so
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and as a result

01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
412
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
making an appropriation to the
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
for nursing home reimbursement rates
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm here i was i was looking for you
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
back in the corner sorry i was hiding in

nashua
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm pleased to introduce senate bill
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
412 which will correct an inadvertent
 
01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.310 align:start position:0%
412 which will correct an inadvertent
error

01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
error
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
that was made last spring when the
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislature increased nursing home rates
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
by 5
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
in house bill 2.
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
this was necessary as nursing homes have
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
seen costs increase
 
01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
but have not been able to operate at
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
full capacity since the start of the
 
01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:28.870 align:start position:0%
full capacity since the start of the
pandemic

01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
the department was directed in house
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill 2 to raise rates by 5 percent
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
starting july 1st
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
and as you know nursing home rate
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
setting is complex
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
it depends on the number of patients and
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
their acuity
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
the inadvertent error was caused by
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
another house bill 2 provision
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
that required reimbursement to be
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
calculated over a higher bed census
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
than has been the reality
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
recently during the pandemic
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
as a result the budgeted appropriation
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
for that five percent rate increase was
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
only enough
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
for the department to raise rates last
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
summer by um
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
an average of just over one percent
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
they were able to make
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
a second adjustment in october
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
to about three and a half percent going
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
forward and again in january to
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
fulfill our promised five percent
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
increase however
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriation in house bill 2
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
might not be enough to backfill the
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
first half of the current fiscal year
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
or sustain the increase through the
 
01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:49.430 align:start position:0%
or sustain the increase through the
biennium

01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
so we worked with
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
the department and lba on language for a
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
contingent five million dollar
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation in case the budget is not
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
adequate to fulfill our commitment to
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
if it's not needed it will lapse at the
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
end of the biennium
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
i want to note also that this rate
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
increase will not increase cost to the
 
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.270 align:start position:0%
increase will not increase cost to the
counties

01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's important
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
i hope you'll all agree with me that the
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislature keeps its promise and passed
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.239 --> 01:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
edwards

01:41:33.510 --> 01:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:41:38.719 --> 01:41:39.910 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
um

01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
so i i was part of the process where we
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to add the five percent uh
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
beginning on july one
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm so what i'm going to ask you
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
is really going to sound like i'm
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to that but i just i just want
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure i understand some logic
 
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:57.830 align:start position:0%
to make sure i understand some logic
here

01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh our logic when we assigned the five
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
percent was that the rates were so low
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
that they were having trouble paying the
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
payroll necessary to attract personnel
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to give them a bump
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
so that they could afford better wages
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
cut down on some of their vacancies that
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we did it
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
but now that this bill is coming forward
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's making it retroactive to july
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
one to keep the promises
 
01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.350 align:start position:0%
one to keep the promises
but

01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's no longer
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
in a able to be timed to influence the
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
salaries and the hiring and it is so
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like the cow has already
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
gotten out of the barn the damage has
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
already been done
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
and that what we maybe ought to be doing
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
is instead of making retroactive to july
 
01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:54.709 align:start position:0%
is instead of making retroactive to july
1

01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
1
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
pick a date in the very near future and
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
so what
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
so what do you think what do you think
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
about what i just said what what is the
 
01:43:04.629 --> 01:43:04.639 align:start position:0%
underlying rationale at
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
this point given that there was a mess
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
up why
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
why should we go retroactive to july 1
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
since it's not going to hire anyone last
 
01:43:13.199 --> 01:43:14.950 align:start position:0%
since it's not going to hire anyone last
august

01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
august
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i i think
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
the problem was
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
bigger than only the ability to recruit
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
and retain staff
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
i think the nursing homes
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
also had higher costs
 
01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:32.709 align:start position:0%
also had higher costs
for

01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:43:32.719 --> 01:43:34.229 align:start position:0%
for
ppe

01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
ppe
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
testing other kinds of supplies
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it was only about staff
 
01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.950 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it was only about staff
but

01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
um i would just reiterate we made a
 
01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.189 align:start position:0%
um i would just reiterate we made a
promise

01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
promise
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
that this would happen july 1st and and
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:43:53.119 --> 01:43:53.910 align:start position:0%
i think
we

01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
are nothing if if you can't rely on our
 
01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.149 align:start position:0%
are nothing if if you can't rely on our
word

01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
what do we really
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
i i i agree
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the with the concept of credibility
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
and keeping the word i i just am looking
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
at the three letters of support that we
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
receive from the new hampshire
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
association of counties
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
the alzheimer's association
 
01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the um and then a individual haley
 
01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.870 align:start position:0%
and the um and then a individual haley
derosas

01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
derosas
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
and all of them really cite that the
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
that the money is needed to
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
improve salaries and hire people so
 
01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.350 align:start position:0%
improve salaries and hire people so
so

01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
so while there may be ppe issues it's it
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
isn't being discussed in any of the
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
testimony we've gotten so far so i guess
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
you're introducing it now well i
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
haven't seen those letters
 
01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:52.950 align:start position:0%
haven't seen those letters
um

01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.070 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
i'd also say that the the fact that the
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
nursing homes have not been operated
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
able to operate at full capacity
 
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:04.629 align:start position:0%
able to operate at full capacity
has

01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
has an effect beyond the nursing homes
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
because it has meant that
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals have had to keep patients
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
beyond their
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
need for hospitalization
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that has resulted
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
at various times over the last year
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
in a lack of available hospital beds in
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
our communities and a necessity to send
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
patients out of the communities and
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes out of state so
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
i think we have to
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
our health care system really as a
 
01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
our health care system really as a
system

01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:45:47.830 --> 01:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
we should be operating
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
all levels of care at capacity to the
 
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
extent that we can because
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
they have impacts
 
01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh i i do have a question and it may be
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
better to ask
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
the counties but
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
my question deals with
 
01:46:19.119 --> 01:46:21.910 align:start position:0%
my question deals with
the

01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
 
workers

01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the people
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
available to fill the jobs
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
we can't fill the nursing home
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
in fiscal
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
given money
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
to help with
 
01:46:40.639 --> 01:46:41.669 align:start position:0%
to help with
the

01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:41.679 --> 01:46:42.709 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
the hospitalization so they can move
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
more quickly to the nursing home
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
but am i hearing you say that
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
the problem is staffing at the nursing
 
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.430 align:start position:0%
the problem is staffing at the nursing
homes

01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's causing the problem
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
not the staffing but something else i
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
think staffing has been
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
a big issue at nursing homes
 
01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:10.709 align:start position:0%
a big issue at nursing homes
for

01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
a number of years but it's been
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
we've had to for example
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes couldn't have
 
01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.870 align:start position:0%
nursing homes couldn't have
um

01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
two patients per room
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
i mean we've had a lot of capacity
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
problems but a lot of it is staffing
 
01:47:32.159 --> 01:47:33.350 align:start position:0%
problems but a lot of it is staffing
and

01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.709 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're not able
 
01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.310 align:start position:0%
we're not able
to

01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:39.669 align:start position:0%
to
require

01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:47:39.679 --> 01:47:40.629 align:start position:0%
require
that

01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
funds be directly passed through
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
to increase wages for staff medicaid
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
regulations don't allow that
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
but there are other ways and we have
 
01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:55.990 align:start position:0%
but there are other ways and we have
heard

01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the nursing homes that their
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
intention is to
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
increase compensation for staff of
 
01:48:05.590 --> 01:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
course we have to fight with
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
facilities that
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
tend to to pay more
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions for senator rosenwald
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sheriff i mean just for
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
my clarity i guess it's not just the
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
cost of staffing and other materials but
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
also um it's a confluence of uh items
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
where nursing homes were hit from all
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
ends for example reimbursement you just
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
met uh mentioned that there's a little
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh shortfall
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement because only one patient
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
per room isn't so it's it's not just
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
tapping it's a
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
plethora of fish anywhere a nursing home
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
has expenses they were impacted and on
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
top of that the reimbursement structure
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
was interrupted as that
 
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
i think it is i think it's a complex
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
situation that is not only staffing but
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
also infection control practices
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
and um supplies but i believe they're
 
01:49:12.639 --> 01:49:13.669 align:start position:0%
and um supplies but i believe they're
here

01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:13.679 --> 01:49:14.629 align:start position:0%
here
and

01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
they can thank you explain it better all
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
set thank you
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions uh
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
representing edwards
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
so this may not be for senator rosenwald
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
but is there's
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from the department who's going
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
to uh testify to us today and if they're
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
not here now can they be here for when
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
division three goes over this this
 
01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.270 align:start position:0%
division three goes over this this
afternoon

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
is there somebody from the department
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
ready to talk about this
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i do have some questions for you all
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
right well when i get a pink card she
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
can come up
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah just just one last
 
01:49:59.199 --> 01:50:00.229 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah just just one last
question

01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
from me
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
this applies to
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
not only county nursing homes but
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
private nursing homes
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh for-profit nursing homes whatever
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
it does because it's a medicaid
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
in some parts of the state more than
 
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.669 align:start position:0%
in some parts of the state more than
others

01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
private nursing homes
 
01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.669 align:start position:0%
private nursing homes
have

01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
residents who are on medicaid so it's
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
not just the counties
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
i thought that was right but wanted to
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely make sure
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you appreciate uh
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
your patience with us for being late it
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%

happy oh thank you
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
i won't mention that okay
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:51.669 align:start position:0%
all right
um

01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
jim monahan
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
yeah new hampshire association of
 
01:50:58.639 --> 01:51:01.270 align:start position:0%
yeah new hampshire association of
counties

01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
great uh good morning um madam chairman
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
i'm jim monahan with the dupont group we
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
represent the new hampshire association
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
of counties
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm here to support senate bill
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
412. i think senator rosenwald um
 
01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.149 align:start position:0%
412. i think senator rosenwald um
in

01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
the exchange representative edwards
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
captured uh what we're trying to address
 
01:51:22.870 --> 01:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
here which was there at in the budget
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
process last year there seemed to be a
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
good bipartisan house senate agreement
 
01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
to try to do a five percent rate
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
increase for
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
all nursing homes uh and
 
01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:33.270 align:start position:0%
all nursing homes uh and
uh

01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
as has been articulated
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
providing adequate general funds to make
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
that work um uh needs to be corrected
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
and so we're here to support that um i
 
01:51:42.719 --> 01:51:43.830 align:start position:0%
and so we're here to support that um i
can

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
certainly get into details if you want
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
but uh the funding for this uh is not
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
um a county expense because of
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
provisions that
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the budget
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
built in last year including the the
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
county cap
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
which doesn't change as a consequence of
 
01:52:04.149 --> 01:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
this rate increase as well as for the
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
new cascade of funds which is
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
articulated in house bill 2
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
that cascade of funds changed so that it
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
would when it comes to funding a rate
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
increase like this it would be federal
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
money medicaid money first uh the
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
general general fund credit
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
then the general fund and then the
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
counties so that combination of the
 
01:52:31.830 --> 01:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
cascade of dollars as well as the county
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
cap ensure that
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a new expense on the
 
01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:36.870 align:start position:0%
this is not a new expense on the
counties

01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm also happy to answer
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
any questions about the the mechanics
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
of this but um i think brooke is
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
probably in a better position to answer
 
01:52:45.199 --> 01:52:46.070 align:start position:0%
probably in a better position to answer
how

01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh the accounting at dhhs um is playing
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
out in this
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry also i'm sure he's about
 
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
to ask me or i can about the issue
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
around staffing i can address that as
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
so uh mr moynihan uh this this letter
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
that's from the association a county
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
signed by wendy piper this this is are
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
you able to talk to this
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
letter is this is this dated april 11th
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir and i have copies for the
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee okay so um there's in the
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
second paragraph uh towards the right
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's it begins to say that the daily
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
rate should be no less than 105 percent
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the average daily rate in effect
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
no no less to me implies that it could
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
be more
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh is is there any intent that it's it's
 
01:53:42.229 --> 01:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
more than the five percent that we
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget cycle
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
is that a poor choice of wording should
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
it just be
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
105 period
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
i mean if you if you want to increase it
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
more i don't think the county nursing
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
homes would object
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
um but that's the i believe that was the
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
language that was included in house bill
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
2 and that's why it's re-articulated in
 
01:54:03.199 --> 01:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
2 and that's why it's re-articulated in
412.

01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay and then uh with regard to the
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
question around you know do we
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a retroactive
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh provision i can speak at least for
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
the counties and as you all know if you
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
go to your account delegation meetings
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
you're on the
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
county nursing home budgets they
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
the expectation was this rate increase
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
would happen and so they plan the
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
budgets accordingly including uh
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
staffing budgets so
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
if the depending on the nursing home uh
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the county there's certainly the risk
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
that if the rate increase
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen there'd be you know to
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
meet your budget you might have to reach
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
into the county funds as you all know
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
the county subsidize those budgets
 
01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.669 align:start position:0%
the county subsidize those budgets
anyway

01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative edwards raised the
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
question about the retroactive increase
 
01:54:59.669 --> 01:54:59.679 align:start position:0%
on staffing costs i believe the counties
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
would find a way within the budgets to
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that those
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
funds are used to cover their staffing
 
01:55:05.679 --> 01:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
funds are used to cover their staffing
budgets

01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me no not all right i'm just
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
trying i'm just
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
trying to think about the county budgets
 
01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:26.229 align:start position:0%
trying to think about the county budgets
um

01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.239 --> 01:55:28.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
so if your county assumed that they were
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to have the five 5 rate increase
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't come then there's a risk
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
they would have to adjust the nursing
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
home budget downward
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's something to consider
 
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
the other consideration is though that
 
01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.030 align:start position:0%
the other consideration is though that
while

01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
while
uh

01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
the the counties do pay the non-federal
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
share of medicaid
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
this is constructed in a way that the
 
01:55:53.119 --> 01:55:53.910 align:start position:0%
this is constructed in a way that the
this

01:55:53.910 --> 01:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
rate increase would not require
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh that the counties match the federal
 
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.149 align:start position:0%
uh that the counties match the federal
funds

01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.159 --> 01:56:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:03.340 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:56:03.340 --> 01:56:03.350 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
most counties have finished their budget
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they haven't but we have
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
in carroll county and i have i have no
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
idea what
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
percent we we looked at but
 
01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:19.589 align:start position:0%
percent we we looked at but
um

01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
i guess that from that
 
01:56:22.159 --> 01:56:23.830 align:start position:0%
i guess that from that
perspective

01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:56:27.109 --> 01:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
what representative edwards said about
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
not being retroactive
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me but i'll let you tell
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
me why yeah it doesn't make sense to you
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
some of the counties have calendar
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
budgets and some of the counties have
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year budgets so i guess my
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
observation had more to do with the
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
county those counties are on the on the
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh representative
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
so am i understanding to follow up on
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative edward's question about
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
the not less than language so if i'm
 
01:57:04.310 --> 01:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
understanding if we if we if this bill
 
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
is approved
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
authorization to allow
 
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh an increase above five percent and in
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
fact to use the five million dollars to
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
we would have appropriated five million
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
well i guess i'll make an observation
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's probably
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
better that you get direction from the
 
01:57:31.030 --> 01:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
on that um as i said the authorization
 
01:57:34.159 --> 01:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
on that um as i said the authorization
to

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
increase rates up to to no less than 105
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
percent was included in the in the
 
01:57:39.199 --> 01:57:40.310 align:start position:0%
percent was included in the in the
budget

01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
um so i believe what uh this legislation
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
is doing is just ensuring that it's an
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
adequate appropriation to meet that
 
01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
adequate appropriation to meet that
obligation

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:49.350 align:start position:0%
obligation
okay

01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay are there any further
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
quote yes for uh representative leishman
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam cheers
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess i have a concern on the
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
retroactive portion of this
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard about staffing issues how
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
does that affect going backwards help
 
01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
by last year you mean
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
well the bills prior to june 30th or
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
after june or or after july 4 says going
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
backwards to be retroactive so i'm
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
curious how bad representative leishman
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
please talk into your mic because as we
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
know people are listening out there
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks madam chair
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned again with the language
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
retroactive and we've talked about
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
staffing issues today
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
how would going back
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
help us with staffing issues
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better going forward to
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
address staffing issues and use the five
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars going forward
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
better pay staff and provide other
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
financials yeah let me i'll try to get
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
some clarity before i come back at three
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock for division three on this um so
 
01:59:01.350 --> 01:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think that and again i think we want
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
to hear from the department around the
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
mechanics of how how it flows you know
 
01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:06.950 align:start position:0%
mechanics of how how it flows you know
um

01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh and and the answer i'll try to get
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
through representative leashman is in
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
the at least for the the counties how
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
have they uh how would they account for
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
not having the 105 having the five
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
percent rate increase
 
01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:20.790 align:start position:0%
percent rate increase
um

01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
and how they have accounted how they it
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
may well be that the budgets include the
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
expectation of that
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh and so they're funding
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
the staffing with the expectation that
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
it'll eventually catch up with them
 
01:59:32.239 --> 01:59:33.350 align:start position:0%
it'll eventually catch up with them
okay

01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
i have great faith in division three
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
madam chairs so i'm sure they'll take
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
care of it thanks
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
so do i are there any further questions
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
i have rosemary
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
is it's
 
01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:50.229 align:start position:0%
is it's
seminole

01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
seminole
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
and she represents the golden view
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare center in meredith
 
01:59:58.390 --> 01:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
which i drive by every single day thank
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
yes so i've been a licensed nursing home
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
administrator in the state of new
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire for over 25 years and i've
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
been at golden view which is an
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
independent nonprofit private facility
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
and i fully support the bill as it's
 
02:00:17.199 --> 02:00:18.310 align:start position:0%
and i fully support the bill as it's
written

02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:19.510 align:start position:0%
written
and

02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to shed some light we
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about staffing issues
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the questions i think um
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is how is this
 
02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:30.550 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is how is this
retroactive

02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
why is that going to help us now
 
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
why is that going to help us now
so

02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know we thought we were getting that
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
five percent money um we
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
budgeted staff increases based on that
 
02:00:40.719 --> 02:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
budgeted staff increases based on that
promise

02:00:42.390 --> 02:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
promise
 
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.109 align:start position:0%
promise
we

02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
first quarter have lost 138 000
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
so getting the money now
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
will help to mitigate those losses going
 
02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:54.629 align:start position:0%
will help to mitigate those losses going
forward

02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that i hope helps them shed a light
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to talk about it's not
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
just staffing
 
02:01:04.149 --> 02:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
staffing is a huge problem
 
02:01:07.229 --> 02:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
golden view has two units closed
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
now i'm in available so they have to go
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes to nashua or even out of state
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
to get the care that they need
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
but we also have issues with food
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
supplies and utilities
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
and this is not including pandemic
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
supplies we've taken out infection
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
control ppe out of this
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
just the cost of utilities have gone up
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
food and supplies are up about two
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifty cents per patient per
 
02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.109 align:start position:0%
dollars and fifty cents per patient per
day

02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so we are in a serious crisis not
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
just staffing but all these other um
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
issues that are before us and i would
 
02:02:06.310 --> 02:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
like to just you know yes the
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is extremely complicated
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
but as a brief statement
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
our reimbursement rates are set on
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
historical costs
 
02:02:19.350 --> 02:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
um the january uh rate setting was based
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
on 2019 costs
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
and the july rate setting was based on
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
2018 costs
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
so they're not even
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
currently reimbursed on our current
 
02:02:32.790 --> 02:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
costs of what we're facing today
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
on top of that we have that wonderful
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
budget neutrality factor
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
which was 22 percent and 25
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
so currently we're at
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
increased costs of about 15 percent
 
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
increased costs of about 15 percent
overall

02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
overall
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
to care for a person
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
yet we're reimbursed on historical cost
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
would then reduce further by the budget
 
02:02:55.910 --> 02:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
neutrality factor
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
so we're out of the gate today at a loss
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
of 45 percent
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's the reality that's where
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're at
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
we do have a demand for our services
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
we can't meet that demand because we
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
can't get staff
 
02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
um not only are the staffing costs
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
astronomically rising
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's also the other things i mentioned
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
the food the utilities and just general
 
02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:25.189 align:start position:0%
the food the utilities and just general
supplies

02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
supplies
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
so this money going retroactively is
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
going to help
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
mitigate extreme losses
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
for our facility and i know i'm not the
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
only provider
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i did want to mention um
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
somebody had mentioned earlier about
 
02:03:49.109 --> 02:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
what it means when a facility closes or
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
when they have
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
closed units it's not just affecting the
 
02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
healthcare continuum
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
as a community nonprofit we
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
provide many opportunities for the
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
schools to have their clinical rotation
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
at our facility
 
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
so it's affecting the local colleges
 
02:04:08.069 --> 02:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
it affects integrated intergenerational
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
program elementary school kids coming
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
we provide education for the community
 
02:04:13.199 --> 02:04:14.950 align:start position:0%
we provide education for the community
free

02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it it's not just the health care
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
continuum we're looking at the impact is
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
greater than that on on the citizenship
 
02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
of of new hampshire and the only other
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
final thing um
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say is um
 
02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:31.030 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say is um
about

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the staff and i um
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
i think the staff are real heroes that
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
continue to work in in nursing homes
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
i really do um not me but the direct
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
care staff
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's not just nursing that's affected
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
it's dining services it's all the things
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
that have to go into the care of an
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
aspect of
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%

02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%

i'm told that uh some of them
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
restrict the amount of medicaid patients
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
because it's unaffordable
 
02:05:23.669 --> 02:05:23.679 align:start position:0%
what's the percentage of medicaid
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
patients in your nursing home um we
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
average about 80 percent medicaid 80
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's a private unusual thank
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%

02:05:48.639 --> 02:05:49.910 align:start position:0%
work session i think that that would be
helpful

02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%

uh we represent most of the state's

private nursing homes jointly represent

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
for children with disabilities and a
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
number of assisted living facilities
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
we strongly commend to you

this bill
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
again this bill
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
addresses a
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
oversight that was made in the budgeting
 
02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
oversight that was made in the budgeting
process

02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
last legislative session it was intended
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
that there be a five percent increase in
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
fact we heralded legislators for having
 
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
fact we heralded legislators for having
provided

02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
that increase and just regrettably
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
mechanically it did not happen
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
we went to work immediately
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
with the department and with sympathetic
 
02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:16.709 align:start position:0%
with the department and with sympathetic
lawmakers

02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
lawmakers
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
to try to rectify this issue and um
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
our members have known since last summer
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
that a fix was on its way
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
and would be proposed in the senate and
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
of course as you know has passed the
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
senate unanimously
 
02:07:30.639 --> 02:07:31.589 align:start position:0%
senate unanimously
uh

02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
with respect to representative edwards's
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh question
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh facilities are not going to enjoy
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
some sort of retroactive
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
surfeit if this money were to be
 
02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
surfeit if this money were to be
appropriated

02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
but they will use it to staunch
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
their ongoing losses
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the provision of care
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
i've included in my uh testimony a
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
letter from
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh catholic charities which is my
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
biggest non-profit
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home provider
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're projecting a loss for this
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year of one and a half million
 
02:08:05.599 --> 02:08:06.550 align:start position:0%
fiscal year of one and a half million
dollars

02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
in their operations
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to operate
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh very much longer
 
02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
with those sorts of losses and this is
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
an organization that has been providing
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
nursing home care in our state
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
since 1948.
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think the same is true of a lot of uh
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
independent uh providers uh that i
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
represent uh family-owned facilities
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh non-profits uh proprietary nonprofit
 
02:08:31.679 --> 02:08:33.109 align:start position:0%
uh non-profits uh proprietary nonprofit
alike

02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
alike
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh everybody is at the edge of a
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
precipice here
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
the nationally we've seen a loss of over
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
400 000 staff
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
for residential care facilities and
 
02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
nursing homes the bureau of labor
 
02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
statistics slumps those two things
 
02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
statistics slumps those two things
together

02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
we actually saw
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
an even greater loss a continued loss
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
in february and march under their
 
02:08:56.159 --> 02:08:57.589 align:start position:0%
in february and march under their
projections

02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
projections
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
if you can't staff you can't build
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
occupancy if you can't staff you can't
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
even maintain
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
the care
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
for the residents that you do have
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
and things become very precarious indeed
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
i've included data from a national
 
02:09:13.599 --> 02:09:14.950 align:start position:0%
i've included data from a national
organization

02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
that shows that new hampshire has the
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
nation's seventh worst
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
staffing crisis but if you look at that
 
02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:22.629 align:start position:0%
staffing crisis but if you look at that
list

02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're not really far away from number
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
one it's just a matter of percentages at
 
02:09:29.189 --> 02:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
this point
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
we just simply can't find the people and
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know all of us are familiar with
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
the concept of the great resignation
 
02:09:37.350 --> 02:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
that occurred
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of the pandemic and
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
people sort of rethinking what sort of
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
work they wanted to get into
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
and uh you know a lot of opportunities
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
have arisen uh for folks and we've seen
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
wage increases in the service economy um
 
02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
and one has to ask oneself
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh if you're working for a nursing home
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh why not just go down the street and
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
work for walmart for more money
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
or for some fast food uh
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
franchise and make more money
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
because you will
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
if you're working in the kitchen and
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
dietary department you definitely will
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
because our ability to pay is
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
constrained by medicaid reimbursement
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
i quote in a letter that i submitted to
 
02:10:21.199 --> 02:10:22.069 align:start position:0%
i quote in a letter that i submitted to
you

02:10:22.069 --> 02:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
my colleague from kentucky
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
who sort of makes the analogy between a
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
nursing home and chick-fil-a
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
if chick-fil-a has increased costs they
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
can pass those costs along to the
 
02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:34.229 align:start position:0%
can pass those costs along to the
customer

02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
customer
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
for us government's the customer we
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
can't pass those costs along
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
and when you hear goldenview say that 80
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
percent of their residents are on
 
02:10:42.159 --> 02:10:44.149 align:start position:0%
percent of their residents are on
medicaid

02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
in response to representative weiler's
 
02:10:46.079 --> 02:10:47.270 align:start position:0%
in response to representative weiler's
question

02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
under federal law if you have a medicaid
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
contract you can't restrict entry uh
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
based on ability to pay so it's first
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
come first serve
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
and so if you've got a a medicaid person
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh who's uh applying to go into your
 
02:11:00.159 --> 02:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
uh who's uh applying to go into your
facility

02:11:01.430 --> 02:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
facility
 
02:11:03.990 --> 02:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
at the same time that a private payer is
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
it's whoever got first in line
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
and chances are you can't admit either
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
at this point just simply because uh
 
02:11:12.709 --> 02:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
facilities uh can't staff to build their
 
02:11:12.719 --> 02:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
facilities uh can't staff to build their
occupancy

02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
occupancy
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh when you look at the fact that we
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
have uh an average occupancy of 77
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
percent right now we were as high as
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
86 percent uh before the pandemic
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's a recipe for disaster
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is an extinction event facilities
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
are not going to be able to continue to
 
02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.390 align:start position:0%
are not going to be able to continue to
operate

02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
operate
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
if they cannot fill those beds
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
and i include the examples of some other
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
states and what they've done on on april
 
02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.470 align:start position:0%
states and what they've done on on april
7th

02:11:40.470 --> 02:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
7th
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire excuse me the nebraska
 
02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:44.229 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire excuse me the nebraska
unicameral

02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
unicameral
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
overrode the governor's veto and gave
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes a 15 percent rate increase
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
and that's after the governor himself
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
had given them a 20 a day rate increase
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
you see examples in any number of states
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
whether they be
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
republican states or democratic states
 
02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
of legislatures
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
rushing to the fore uh because this is a
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
crisis uh throughout the entire country
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh we have been very grateful uh for
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
the cares act funds that have been
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
allocated to us uh by uh governor sununu
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh by the executive council
 
02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
by the joint fiscal committee
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
but we're going to need additional
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
assistance uh even this five percent
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
rate increase is but a drop in the
 
02:12:29.599 --> 02:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
rate increase is but a drop in the
bucket

02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
bucket
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh compared to
 
02:12:34.470 --> 02:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
where we are at right now uh we are
 
02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:35.669 align:start position:0%
where we are at right now uh we are
bleeding

02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
bleeding
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
and this will not staunch that bleeding
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
you will see closures of nursing homes
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:12:42.239 --> 02:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
and

02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
when a nursing home closes vulnerable
 
02:12:48.550 --> 02:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
people are displaced and they're no
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
longer cared for in their community
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
they're displaced far away in many cases
 
02:12:53.679 --> 02:12:54.470 align:start position:0%
they're displaced far away in many cases
and

02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
staff lose their jobs
 
02:12:58.629 --> 02:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
and in some communities those nursing
 
02:13:01.589 --> 02:13:01.599 align:start position:0%
homes are among your largest employers
 
02:13:01.599 --> 02:13:02.870 align:start position:0%
homes are among your largest employers
so

02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's a desperate situation and we really
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for considering this bill
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
because again
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
it would effectuate what it is that you
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
intended to do
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
what it is that
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
providers relied upon
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
in knowing that this legislature was
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
trying to do the right thing
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
effective last july 1st and
 
02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:25.830 align:start position:0%
effective last july 1st and
so

02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:29.189 --> 02:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
every aspect of this bill is commendable
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
if anything we would wish it to be
 
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:33.270 align:start position:0%
if anything we would wish it to be
increased

02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
and we we thank you very much for your
 
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
consideration i'm happy to
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
very happy to take any questions
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
 
02:13:47.189 --> 02:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair so um
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
very compelling testimony thank you a
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
lot of good information in there i i
 
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
lot of good information in there i i
i

02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
am trying to
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
parse together
 
02:13:58.950 --> 02:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of things you said that we're
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
facing sort of an existential threat
 
02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
with our nursing home
 
02:14:03.199 --> 02:14:04.629 align:start position:0%
with our nursing home
continuity

02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
continuity
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
and that we have a a long-term
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
employer employment problem
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
and if we got a long-term employment
 
02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.030 align:start position:0%
and if we got a long-term employment
problem

02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
and we we can throw we can we can
 
02:14:19.510 --> 02:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
certainly spend this five percent
 
02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:20.709 align:start position:0%
certainly spend this five percent
but

02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
how how how does that
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
stop or halt
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
the existential threat that you're
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
referring to when we're still confronted
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
with a long-term problem
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill may be necessary but it's not
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient where what what must we do
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
to really address this
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative i have to have the
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
humility to say i'm not sure uh
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
certainly this bill uh isn't enough in
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
terms of what it would do you're right
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is a long-term crisis right now
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
facilities are resorting to out-of-state
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
staffing agencies in order to just
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
simply maintain staffing
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
those agencies have increased their
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
prices to the point where you might be
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
paying 50 an hour for a licensed nursing
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
assistant uh once these out-of-state
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
agencies enter your facility they start
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
hiring away your own staff
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh where whereupon you're then paying
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
the agency for your own staff to work
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
for you and uh it really feels like
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
we're swirling down the drain uh you
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
know i think something like
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
the examples of what the other states
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
have done in terms of
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
an appropriation of american rescue plan
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
act funds uh would be
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh very helpful uh we have to get
 
02:15:37.990 --> 02:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
through this moment and uh you know
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're focusing on
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
right now is uh just simply
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh survival and uh getting through this
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
moment and uh for for many providers it
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
feels like that's that's almost
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
impossible but i can say with respect to
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
this bill representative that
 
02:15:55.910 --> 02:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know increasing the base rate uh by
 
02:15:57.669 --> 02:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
five percent is something that you can
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
then build on uh going forward you'll
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
recall that in the previous biennium uh
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid rates for all classes of
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
providers were increased by 6.2 percent
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
there was two separate increases of 3.1
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
per annum
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
and so actually this increase is less
 
02:16:17.109 --> 02:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
than that and we're amidst a uh pandemic
 
02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
of you know just horrendous consequences
 
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
for all of health care so
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know whatever additional funding
 
02:16:26.390 --> 02:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh this general court is willing to
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
provide uh would be greatly appreciated
 
02:16:31.189 --> 02:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
but this is the minimum i think in terms
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
of what can be done
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
and i hate to be so gloomy but this is
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
just these are the facts are there any
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you it sounds to me like what we
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
need to do is figure out what kind of
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
increase you need to be competitive with
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
the private market and not just in
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
health care but the private market
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
across the board and skilled jobs
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
and that that's the amount of money we
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
need to give you guys that that there is
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
a solution but that's what it is and
 
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
somebody we need the the money people to
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
crunch those numbers and figure out what
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
the rate increase is and then we need to
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
dig deep into our pockets and find that
 
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
money and make you guys competitive so
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
that the beds can be open because i will
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
use an example our dear friend who just
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
died this weekend was supposed to be
 
02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
moved to a nursing home and they could
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
not find a nursing home bed for her
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
which would have kept her in the
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
hospital at a much greater cost than a
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
nursing home bed and that's what it
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
means not to have beds available and
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's really close and personal at home
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
i want to express my sympathy for the
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
passing of representative rogers who's a
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
a very good person um it seems as too
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
too many good people in this uh general
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
court have passed uh of late
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
um and you're absolutely right i mean
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
that is a consequence uh you know it was
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
it was reference that there has been
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
sort of a piecemeal effort and by
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
calling a piecemeal i'm not disparaging
 
02:17:58.950 --> 02:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
it but there's been a piecemeal effort
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the part of the state to try to ease
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
hospital capacity by providing some
 
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
staffing again through staffing agencies
 
02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
staffing again through staffing agencies
to

02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
certain nursing homes in order to
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
relieve some of that hospital backlog
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
but again piecemeal effort and so that
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
that problem still exists that that
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
those who are in the hospital setting
 
02:18:24.070 --> 02:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
may not be able to access a nursing home
 
02:18:25.429 --> 02:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
for discharge
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
and it's obviously inappropriate for
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
them to stay in the hospital setting and
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
of course if the state's a payer in that
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
instance it's going to cost a heck of a
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
lot more if the state's paying through
 
02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:35.349 align:start position:0%
lot more if the state's paying through
medicaid

02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
we also have the situation where those
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
in home and community-based services
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
which we fully support by the way
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
may need to step up not forever but may
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
need to step up to a nursing home level
 
02:18:50.389 --> 02:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
of care and if they are unable to do
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
that what's gonna happen they're gonna
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
end up in a hospital because they're
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
gonna get so sick that they're gonna end
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
up in a hospital and then irony of
 
02:18:59.110 --> 02:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
ironies they won't be able to be
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
discharged to a nursing home because
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
there won't be a bed available so it
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
really is
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
a systemic problem it's all
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
interconnected i think as you point out
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
what happens with nursing homes affects
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
the home and community-based services
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
what happens with nursing homes affects
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
if i heard testimony correctly
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
over the course of
 
02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:30.389 align:start position:0%
over the course of
uh

02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:30.399 --> 02:19:31.509 align:start position:0%
uh
the

02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
22 biennium
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
you have received
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
some percentage in the nursing homes and
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a better question for hhs
 
02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.030 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a better question for hhs
but

02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
but
um

02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure the law right now
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
the bills the law said 105
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
if you got three percent in one quarter
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
then i give you two percent to make up
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
if i got one percent then do i give you
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
four percent
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
because i can't just give you an across
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
five percent for
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
that whole time
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
because the nursing homes over time have
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
received something
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
that becomes
 
02:20:16.389 --> 02:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
a nightmare
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
a nightmare
 
02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:18.790 align:start position:0%
a nightmare
for

02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
anyone to try to solve
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we go retroactive
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that if we start
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
one january or whatever whatever date it
 
02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
one january or whatever whatever date it
is

02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
on the calendar year
 
02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
we may not have
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
that kind of horrible situation
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out that you got three
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
percent these were your costs this was
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
anyhow i just
 
02:20:47.110 --> 02:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that just just to answer uh
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh you know the department
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
was involved in the construct of this
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and some of the increases
 
02:20:56.710 --> 02:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
that were referenced were really the
 
02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
consequence of what's called the case
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
mix index and so
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh the acuity of the resonance the the
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
physical need of the residents and so
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
that will cause uh within the resources
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
appropriated by this body
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
that will cause the the rates to
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
obviously creep up and as was also
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
referenced uh there was a switch to a
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
new cost year uh during the biennium as
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
the basis for reimbursement that too
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
will also cause
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
things to creep up again that cost year
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
is only now 2019. we haven't entered the
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic cost years in terms of the
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but that will explain why
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
there has been some increase in the
 
02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:39.030 align:start position:0%
there has been some increase in the
rates

02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
separate from this legislature's intent
 
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
to increase them by five percent
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:49.670 align:start position:0%
anything else
uh

02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
i now call on brooke belanger
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that uh i didn't realize you
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
were here brooke and we would have had
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
you in earlier but uh thank you so much
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
for being here and i know that you are
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
the font of all answers so we wish that
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
were true oh it is it's got to be
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
certainly when uh director henry littman
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
is here this afternoon he will uh be
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
able to give you much more detail than i
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
can but i'm happy to do my best this i
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want me to give you
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
a quick response to some of the
 
02:22:28.790 --> 02:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions i heard or if you'd rather
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
direct the questions at me no i i think
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful
 
02:22:33.439 --> 02:22:34.389 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful
okay

02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh there was some conversation about the
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
language of no less than a hundred and
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
five percent if i could shed a little
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
rates are based on average rates for all
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
facil for all facilities rather than any
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
one facility and so you need that
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
language in there as a result of those
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
average rates for all facilities i would
 
02:22:59.110 --> 02:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
also say that
 
02:23:01.110 --> 02:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
adjusting a nursing facility rate and
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
giving them an across-the-board rate
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
increase as was intended by this body um
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
02:23:10.389 --> 02:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different mechanisms
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
that contribute to the nursing facility
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
rate uh and so there are different
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
levers including the county cap that jim
 
02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
monahan spoke about that
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
impact nursing facility reimbursement
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
harder to adjust and make that rate
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
increase with um
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's hard to make it just a blanket and
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
so these levers are there in place and
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is really a contingency plan
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the department is able to
 
02:23:43.750 --> 02:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
the the committee has heard the
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
situation and is well aware of the
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
situation in nursing facilities but this
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill allows us to carry out the
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
directives of this body in hb2
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
i would also note that
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in here to ensure
 
02:24:03.270 --> 02:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
that any unused funds would lapse so
 
02:24:04.950 --> 02:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
that any concern of
 
02:24:04.960 --> 02:24:06.150 align:start position:0%
that any concern of
um

02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
spending more than that 105 percent
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
increase would come back
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
and would lapse but again that language
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
of no more than is is there because
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
rates are based on an average rate for
 
02:24:19.830 --> 02:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
all facilities and as
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
brandon williams spoke about there's a
 
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
case mix index um there is
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
acuity rates there's utilization
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
as this body knows utilization has
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
decreased for a number of reasons
 
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
staffing a component of it
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
but if we see volume come back in the
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
next year of the biennium
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
there will be these funds will certainly
 
02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
there will be these funds will certainly
be

02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
needed to ensure that we can meet that
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
i am curious if we put five percent
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
increase in the budget why it wasn't
 
02:25:03.439 --> 02:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
increase in the budget why it wasn't
paid

02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
there

02:25:08.230 --> 02:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:09.349 align:start position:0%
there
the

02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
effort to get the funds to the
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
facilities was done uh was carried out
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
by the department there are a number of
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
different funds that get used to pay out
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
the rates and i believe it was mr
 
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
monaghan who indicated that there is a
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
cascade of how funds get used
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
there are funds that are appropriated by
 
02:25:32.550 --> 02:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
this body there are federal funds and
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
there are county funds
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
and so those get used to pay out the
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
rates and then there's the 504
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
account as well which gets paid out to
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
facilities so when using those different
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
levers and those different sources of
 
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.910 align:start position:0%
levers and those different sources of
fund

02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:49.670 align:start position:0%
fund
the

02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
efforts to meet those increases was out
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
there this bill ensures a and provides a
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
contingency to make sure that there are
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds to meet that intention
 
02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:01.670 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds to meet that intention
follow-up

02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:26:03.910 --> 02:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
i still don't understand why if we put
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
the five percent in the budget the
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony seems to
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
indicate it never got paid
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
and you're not answering why
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
i apologize i don't mean to not be
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
answering your question so um there have
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
been rate increases um there have
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
to the facilities um
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
at different points in the year there
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
have been percentage increases um there
 
02:26:31.990 --> 02:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
was also language in hb2 that
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
was the number of days um i believe that
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
impacted the ability to carry out that
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
rate increase
 
02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:40.070 align:start position:0%
rate increase
and

02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
when director littman is here this
 
02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon he can speak a bit more
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
articulately to that i don't want to um
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
swim above my my head if you will and
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
and give you the wrong information thank
 
02:26:51.359 --> 02:26:54.389 align:start position:0%
and give you the wrong information thank
you

02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.070 --> 02:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and um
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay so in the military we used to do
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
things called after action reviews after
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
you did it conducted an exercise
 
02:27:09.990 --> 02:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
good bad or indifferent you you figured
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
out what what what went right and what
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
didn't go right okay we obviously did
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
something wrong
 
02:27:19.270 --> 02:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
right because we we had the intent and
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
by we i mean me i was the chair of
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
division three
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i did not catch
 
02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
and i did not catch
whatever

02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
the hb2 issues were that created this
 
02:27:31.190 --> 02:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
cascade right so i'm not going to beat
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
myself up but what i would like to do
 
02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:34.550 align:start position:0%
myself up but what i would like to do
though

02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
though
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
is to take your oral history
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
the oral history of mr monahan mr
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
lippman whoever else ms rounds
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
and and document it
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
in a nice tight description of exactly
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
what went wrong
 
02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
so that we don't do this again
 
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to understand that okay
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
so um so if you could if you could maybe
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
prep mr lippman to speak to a document
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
that describes
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
in sort of an after-action review format
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
and i can give you that
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh i i want to know what we did wrong
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
because the legislature apparently put
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
some conflicting guidance in hb2
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
that when it got time to execute
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
at the department level
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
you guys got contradictory information
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
and failed to do what we intended you to
 
02:28:29.270 --> 02:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
do so we just need to understand that is
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
that is that fair
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:33.990 align:start position:0%
we can
provide

02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:28:36.790 --> 02:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
a description of what the conflict was
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh what the language of conflict was and
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
the efforts that we have made
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
to meet those terms but i understand
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
what you're asking and we can bring that
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
back to you
 
02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
and just so you know that's wholly
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
independent of whether or not i'm going
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
to support this legislation i i just i
 
02:28:54.469 --> 02:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
understand what went wrong thank you and
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
i don't and i i think representative
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
weiler doesn't fully understand it yet
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
either and i want to make sure i can
 
02:29:05.910 --> 02:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
explain it to him
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i will make sure that the
 
02:29:09.349 --> 02:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee has the information that
 
02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
you've asked for all right thank you
 
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
i also might want to point out that um
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
although uh representative edwards
 
02:29:19.990 --> 02:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
didn't give you kind of a timeline
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's short
 
02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:24.630 align:start position:0%
uh it's short
okay

02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
i am quite confident that director
 
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
littman can answer many of these um
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
specifics this afternoon for you and any
 
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up documentation that is needed
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
as soon as i get back to the office
 
02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
we'll start working on okay thank you
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
i don't wanna anyhow
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
short is my problem but if we don't have
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
the right information then it becomes
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's problem
 
02:29:48.150 --> 02:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
i am fairly confident in saying that
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
this afternoon many of these questions
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
will be cleared up and any additional
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
supporting documentation that the
 
02:29:56.790 --> 02:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
committee would like we will make sure
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
we make that a high priority together
 
02:29:59.830 --> 02:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
represent lynn you have a question
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair um you know
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
can i go back to because i'm not quite
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
sure i understand the your explanation
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the no less than in other words if if
 
02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
i understand correctly you said that you
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
need that language because the
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates are determined on an
 
02:30:17.359 --> 02:30:18.790 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates are determined on an
average

02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
of of reimbursements to a group of
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
homes is that
 
02:30:26.309 --> 02:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
a group of nursing homes is that correct
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
individual rates are set on a number of
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
factors case mix index so the acuity of
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
the individuals they are cost based
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
there are a number of factors that go
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
into the rates and so
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
different than saying
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to set a five percent rate
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
on uh increase on a hundred dollars it's
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
not a a set base across the industry and
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
so because there are multiple factors
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
and in
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
there are different rates among
 
02:31:00.630 --> 02:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
different facilities based on cost and
 
02:31:03.510 --> 02:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
case mix index and a number of factors
 
02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:04.389 align:start position:0%
case mix index and a number of factors
that

02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
language of no less than 105
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
is needed to ensure that they get the
 
02:31:11.510 --> 02:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
rate increase
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
so may i ask a follow-up yes you may so
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
so am i understanding from that that
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that what that means by what that
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
language would mean
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the in other words to get to an
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
average that means it has to be some
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
above and some below and in my
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that what this language
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
would mean is that
 
02:31:37.990 --> 02:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
effectively you would take the lowest
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
and make sure that that
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
that that reimbursement increased five
 
02:31:45.439 --> 02:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
that that reimbursement increased five
percent

02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:31:46.960 --> 02:31:48.070 align:start position:0%
percent
with

02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
presumably the result that there would
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
be that some that were above the average
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
would increase
 
02:31:54.830 --> 02:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
more than five
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
percent so the goal is to ensure that
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
the five percent increase for hb2 is
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
carried out i want to if i could have
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to take that back and
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
confirm what the range would be i can
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
bring that back i understand that's an
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
important question and i don't want to
 
02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
misspeak on what that would look like so
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
if i can have the opportunity to take
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
that back i will bring that information
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i've heard it uh
 
02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:26.070 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i've heard it uh
several

02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
several
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
several comments today about talking
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
about uh unused funds with laps not that
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
i anticipate there would be any unused
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
funds but where does it specifically
 
02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
talk about lapsing funds
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
the in order to use these funds the
 
02:33:06.150 --> 02:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
department has to make the request for
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
brooke it's not there
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay i apologize miners so i believe
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's built based on my understanding of
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
it was that we would only be able to
 
02:33:31.270 --> 02:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
have the funds that were needed based on
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
an articulation and the request for
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
to be clear you weren't the only person
 
02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
who said let that they would lap so
 
02:33:42.309 --> 02:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
so i have a question of the chair oh me
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
please do you think i have an answer i
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
think on this one you might uh
 
02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:55.349 align:start position:0%
think on this one you might uh
is

02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:33:57.190 --> 02:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
because i was looking at this looking
 
02:33:59.270 --> 02:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
for the same language whether the word
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
non-lapse or lapse was used and and
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
because it's not in here i'm just
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
curious do do we do we just assume
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
all monies that we appropriate in a
 
02:34:11.190 --> 02:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
two-year cycle are to lapse unless we've
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
explicitly said non-lapsing and because
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
we haven't specified non-lapsing in here
 
02:34:19.270 --> 02:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
does this mean this defaults to to
 
02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:20.309 align:start position:0%
does this mean this defaults to to
elapse

02:34:20.309 --> 02:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
elapse
 
02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
and that's probably why it doesn't say
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything in here
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
because it always
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's the way it goes
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions for
 
02:34:34.319 --> 02:34:36.389 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions for
brooke

02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
brooke
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
02:34:41.270 --> 02:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
whoops thank you very much
 
02:34:42.230 --> 02:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
and i have no one on the blue sheet that
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't testified
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
for those of us on the fiscal committee
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
we'll get back together at one o'clock
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe most of the divisions are
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
meeting at three
 
02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
meeting at three
so

02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:06.950 --> 02:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
we'll see you then
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:58.070 align:start position:0%

02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
