you doing but we're doing
 
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
you doing but we're doing
it mila's

it mila's
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
multiple employer welfare arrangements
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
the one that evidently
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the department did tell her but
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
she just didn't
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%

okay uh
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate any discussion
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
on the motion
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
well there is this perception out there
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
um create a limited market in the market
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
for people to have can come together to
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
create health insurance i mean i hear a
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
lot of times people keep talking the
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce's canada chamber of
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
commerce you know so and it's just that
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
the people don't
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
need to know that that's just never
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh for insurance you know you need you
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
need critical mass
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
yeah you got to get you got to really
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
make it you to to handle
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
that uh the statistical odds of having a
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
cancer patient that's going to cost you
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
a million dollars you need to have 3 000
 
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
a million dollars you need to have 3 000
lives

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.710 align:start position:0%
lives
and

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's really where that's our meewal
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
law is the 3000. we have on the books
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
this other do we what is it called the
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
other one that's called
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah once you just
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
have them
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
the purchasing alliance that's it that's
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
right purchasing alliance
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
and we've had in the person you want to
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
hit the mic the purchasing alliance is
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
on the books
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct and one of the
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
requirements would be to be a qualified
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
purchasing alliance and uh you're
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
correct that had been in 3 000 numbers
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
for a long time last year as a part of
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislative i think was last year as a
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
part of legislation has changed to 500
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
to 500. you're right i mean to the
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
extent that you're looking at sort of a
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
critical mass and some predictability
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
higher numbers help right yeah so you
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
got to have it and then but there's the
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
startup cost to put one of these things
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
together so an idea of a pilot program
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know where that ever came from i
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
don't know but but you're just you're
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
not gonna you don't you don't you're not
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
gonna go into it with knowing that it
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
could sunset in two years on you i mean
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna go into something like
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
that you would you would it's a serious
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
investment to make it pull it off
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree
 
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.069 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree
yes

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
perfect answer
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion on the motion of any
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
speed to legislate okay committee please
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
say ah
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
right raise your hand
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%

blurb ahead of time
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%

00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
so yeah just no no next wednesday we're
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%

exactly next wednesday okay
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
relative to coverage for certain mental
 
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.069 align:start position:0%
relative to coverage for certain mental
illnesses

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:29.350 align:start position:0%
illnesses
373

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so senate bill 373 was actually one
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
requested by the insurance department in
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
order to basically take advantage of
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
federal guidance around mental health
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
parity comparative analysis and
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
requirements that are being imposed by
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government through the dol
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
on carriers serving self-insured
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
employers the insurance department has
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
been working on mental health parity
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
compliance for a long time and to the
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
extent we align our efforts with the
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
federal efforts then we're asking the
 
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
carriers to produce one set of
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
comparative analysis
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the economies of
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
scale with that okay so i think we have
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment for this one is that yes
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's why it's here
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
that's why it's on the calendar okay
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh john yep the amendment was in the
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
last part it was supposed to read the
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall adopt rules as
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
necessary right very simple little
 
00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:07.590 align:start position:0%
necessary right very simple little
amendment

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
kristen do we do we get an amendment
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.350 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.509 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's fine with us as necessary
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
as necessary
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
as necessary
 
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
as necessary
okay

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
do you mind just sending that to her and
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
for the exact session
 
00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
for the exact session
yes

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
whether yeah the channel is not being
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
deleted so the challenge is going to go
 
00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.790 align:start position:0%
deleted so the challenge is going to go
back

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.189 align:start position:0%
back
i'm

00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
and the senate changed it to may
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
because all they did was change that one
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
word and we're changing it is
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
which is same as his shot there's two
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
ways to say shall we
 
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
ways to say shall we
okay

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
all right so you'll get you'll send that
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
over to her we can do that okay so we
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
can't really
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess i can take a straw vote
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
is everybody okay with that amendment
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
with this bill yeah okay let's draw a
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't think it's enough to
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
to vote in in an opposition but it just
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
what's the better way to say it
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
tyler i think we're flexible i think
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
either way to the extent that look i
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day if rules are
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
necessary we will do them we just don't
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
want to be obligated and this really
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
came out of an lba audit of the
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
department you didn't do rules when it
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
says you shall do rules so anyway you
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
get to a point where we have some
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
flexibility we're happy
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
so who who thought this was necessary
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
who what english teacher thought we
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you did client i may i'm no i i
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
didn't propose it that's for sure but
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
i know i have my notes here but i don't
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
know does anybody remember
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
i did make a note to follow up on it i
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't remember but i remember the
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
conversation i remember the conversation
 
00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.230 align:start position:0%
conversation i remember the conversation
but

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
and as i said i i'm i'm willing to
 
00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
support the boat in either either
 
00:15:50.079 --> 00:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
support the boat in either either
direction

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay i just the wording and i think we
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
started to see that wording elsewhere i
 
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
started to see that wording elsewhere i
think

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
uh some other bill we had that on or we
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
suggested that himself i have to admit i
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
like the word may
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
because implies that they have to think
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
i must admit i like me better than chal
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's one of my rules of thumb
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
if we stay with me when it comes to
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
it does it doesn't matter either way
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
we we initially get drafted with may but
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
we're flexible
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
paula paula former insurance
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
all right so let's just pass this as is
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then we won't have to worry about it
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
what do you guys think
 
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
what do you guys think
okay

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
all right representative van gaal now
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
he's on something
 
00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.790 align:start position:0%
he's on something
okay

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
then that would add the necessary if we
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
pass it as it is not in there
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah because it's that just that's me
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
maybe as necessary that's what i think
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
the conversation came out was we wanted
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
if it's may
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
we're giving the discretion and the
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
decision-making authority to them if
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's shell
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
then we're saying you you need to do
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
this no so we're not going to show you
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
as necessary well i thought the next
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
they would have to decide that it was
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
necessary not us so where did dean go
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
so deem is gone adopt rules is deemed
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
necessary so where are we now we're
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
we're done just leave it leave this just
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
to pass something we're not doing
 
00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
to pass something we're not doing
anything

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
so what you suggested yesterday is
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
vanished we're just doing maybe
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
we're happy with it the way it is as it
 
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.950 align:start position:0%
we're happy with it the way it is as it
is

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
so everything in between is off the
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
board now ols is a swap
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
yes well we did our due diligence and
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.789 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
is that straw still waiting
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
no this will forget about the straw
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
goddess there is a plastic straw or
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
paper yes
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sure what line is that on his tail
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
no i know as we like to carry this bill
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
who cares about it
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay okay so but for the committee right
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
now we'll just i'll do it and then two
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
sec is a ghost monster so he can do it
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i will move it and
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
seconds it uh we move ought to pass
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion seeing none
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
everyone who's in favor please raise
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
their hands on the subcommittee
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
next up uh relative to financial
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay so what representative bartlett
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
second by representative hunt
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your emotion
 
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your emotion
sure

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
um and i think that the um all the
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
parties came together on this one we got
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bankers association we've got
 
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.909 align:start position:0%
the bankers association we've got
um

00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
merrimack county savings was also
 
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
merrimack county savings was also
um

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor
 
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:50.630 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor
um

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
banking department took no position
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
they were okay with the language they
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
worked with the bankers association to
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%

let's see what is it it's the
um

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%

um

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
the lending uh that the lending uh
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
and and the new
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the manufactured housing association
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's requiring that they be
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
the ones who do this and
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
what if the association
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
wants to have a different organization
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think it borrows from another
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
organization doing it it's large
 
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.909 align:start position:0%
organization doing it it's large
notification

00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
notification
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
okay just notification of them but it's
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's out there but it turns out i'll
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
vote for this but i still don't like the
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.029 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
you want to be you want to speak to that
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
why i mean why are you
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
because i think that this bill basically
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
these two bills basically
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
are ensuring that the that there's one
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
lender who continuously gets to be
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
the lender
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh that the only one that's really
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
making any money from this is uh is the
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:20.789 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:21.590 align:start position:0%
well
uh

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's not free enterprise i i mean and
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.990 align:start position:0%
that's not free enterprise i i mean and
if

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
so i i mean i just think i just think
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
this is a self uh
 
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
this is a self uh
self

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
self
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
gratifying kind of thing in that it's
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
not uh it's not fair to the residents
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
because they're forced to they're forced
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
that they hadn't even signed up for
 
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.789 align:start position:0%
that they hadn't even signed up for
so

00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
i i just i just don't like to have a
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
lending institution be able to do
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
10-year loans and automatic and and
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
automatically charge them again and
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
again and again
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's no way that that the owners can
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
now ever pay off the loan
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
because they're not charging enough to
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
do it and it's just ensuring it's just
 
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.750 align:start position:0%
do it and it's just ensuring it's just
ensuring

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
ensuring
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's just ensuring
 
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
uh it's just ensuring
that

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
lender is
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
perpetually going to have a loan
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
and perpetually will be
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
will be paying it off would you buy a
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
house this way
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
notifications yeah so let me cut to the
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
chase rich okay
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
this whole law was created by the
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislature in sympathy
 
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.070 align:start position:0%
legislature in sympathy
of

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
mobile home park owners
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
who and i will just state it again
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
because i just want to rub it in who
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
refused to get a lease and have a
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
contract with the park owner to ensure
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
that they knew how much their rent
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
increases would be
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
but they never did that never have
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
always thought there was a reason for
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
them not doing it and then they came to
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature and say oh my god help
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
us out to get financing so that we can
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
buy the park
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
that was the idea the legislature
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
fortunately at the time because we
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
didn't have a we don't have a state bank
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
we actually have a housing authority
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
which is a non-profit
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
501 c 3 because i think i write checks
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
out to them okay and they
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
are willing to take on a loan with
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
how much down payment do they you
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
actually get you don't get any down
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
payment so i don't know any real estate
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
transaction where you can buy something
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
without having a down payment
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why this organization
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
organization of choice because it's the
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
only one
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
and they're a non-profit uh and they're
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
all that when the money comes in they
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
turn it around and loan it out to other
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh people who are are struggling to be
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
able to get mortgages so it's a very
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
valuable honorable organization
 
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.549 align:start position:0%
valuable honorable organization
and

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
so i know that you're feeling a little
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
sketchy about it but i can assure you
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
that they are a very good very important
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
part of new hampshire and it's a good
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
reason why we don't have a state bank
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
because it does what the
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
the south dakota state bank does which
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
is is to go give low financing low
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
mortgages in this case a mortgage that
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
has no down payment so yes it's a little
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
awkward in terms of how they do the
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
deals and how it's set up
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
thanks i hope that helps
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
well i don't i don't change my mind on
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
i will go along with you
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%

00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%

ounce in half right

okay

00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%

billio moves out to pass
 
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.190 align:start position:0%
billio moves out to pass
yep

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
i had a question about the number 839
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
leader cases
 
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.710 align:start position:0%
leader cases
something

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
some other bill that we have dealt with
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
i recall having a different number
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh and i want to make sure that we're
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not confusing or
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
contradicting or conflicting with other
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
bills that have passed why don't you
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.110 align:start position:0%
yeah
and

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
press the button and pull the mic and
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
you're good to go
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
so far so good okay so the question is
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
is this number consistent with other
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
farmers market legislation for instance
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh mr chairman uh
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative your committee saw a bill
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
earlier this year that dealt with
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
establishing a
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer license for farms
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
and uh that was amended
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
and it came back to you as a
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
did not single out farms for the
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility but it singled out anybody
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
who wanted to get that type of license
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
um who manufactures under a thousand
 
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.430 align:start position:0%
um who manufactures under a thousand
cases

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
and gave them a new fee
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
of three hundred dollars
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
for that level of production if they
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
exceed that level of production
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
then their fee would go up to 16.95
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
this this bill has to do with
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an extension if you will
 
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.349 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an extension if you will
of

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
what a liquor manufacturer can do so
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
let's assume that this new business gets
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
in they become a distiller or get a
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer's license they make
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
750 cases in their first year
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
they are still eligible because of the
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
amount of their production
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
to take their products to farmers
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
markets if they wish
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
and uh operate there to sell it at
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
retail and offer samples things of that
 
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:42.950 align:start position:0%
retail and offer samples things of that
nature

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
nature
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
so they're they're similar in that they
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
deal with liquor manufacturers but
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're separate
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
um and they do mesh well they don't we
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
don't see any problem on our end
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
if both of these bills were to pass
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay it works for me
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
for the question yes representative i
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you mr chair i
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
have a question about um
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
the farmers markets um umbrella like the
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture that governs
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
the farmers markets are they
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
fine with this legislation do you know
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
well the uh the liquor manufacturer's
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
attendance at farmer's market it was the
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
third piece in what was previously
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
allowed for beverages
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then for wine
 
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.470 align:start position:0%
and then for wine
and

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
the establishment of allowing liquor
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to get there was just
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
rounding it out
 
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
rounding it out
so

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
we have nothing to do with the umbrella
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the farmer's market process other
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
than to tell the licensee
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're eligible to attend and
 
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.589 align:start position:0%
you're eligible to attend and
participate

00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
under the rules established by the
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
farmers market so they
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure exactly what those are but
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
we would expect them to adhere to those
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
rules and whatever limitations were
 
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative van gaal thanks uh
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i'm also going to vote in
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
favor of this but i'm going to just
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
bring up something that i brought up in
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
the past several times because as we see
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
these bills kind of pulling together i
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
see the three tiers being
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
shoved elsewhere and i'm not necessarily
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
100 of a fan of the three tiers but if
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have that system let's
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
have it let's not go beyond the
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
parameters of the system and and in
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
light of something that was said
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday relevant to another bill
 
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.710 align:start position:0%
yesterday relevant to another bill
um

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
we really need to to look to be sure
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we are ensuring equity among all
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
the all the uh different manufacturers
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
and distributors and everything else and
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing a patchwork
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
job of this right now i'm not blaming
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
you nor am i blaming the legislature but
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
i think in our in our
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
our haste if you will
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to bring things to life again in
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to get people outside to
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
get people enjoying themselves we may be
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
patching up pieces and not being careful
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
about how the whole lay of the land is
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to be presented and that's just my
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
soapbox for today and aiden nothing
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
against you guys or anybody i think our
 
00:38:07.109 --> 00:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
purposes are valid and valuable but they
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
may not be bringing a result that we'll
 
00:38:11.349 --> 00:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
be happy with five years down the road
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think alcohol laws are oftentimes uh
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
signified by
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
playing catch-up
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
one segment gets one thing and then the
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
other segments want to catch up and so
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
you may see
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
legislation following after legislation
 
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:31.670 align:start position:0%
legislation following after legislation
where

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's a perception that one segment of
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
the industry has received an advantage
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
that the others don't have and then
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
there's the pursuit of
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
that type of parity
 
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
that type of parity
so

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
these laws are and whenever we see these
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
types of bills we always try to step
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
back and look at how they fit within the
 
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.950 align:start position:0%
back and look at how they fit within the
system

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
the commission is never in the position
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
of trying to pick winners and losers but
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
we are trying to look at the system from
 
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.990 align:start position:0%
we are trying to look at the system from
that

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
10 000 foot level to say what is the
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
impact here and we try to make sure that

and as i said i think we have a mighty
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
purpose here i think we really do want

purpose here i think we really do want
to

johnson and
 
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.470 align:start position:0%
johnson and
terry

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:35.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i'm more interested in
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
entertaining a motion of an expedient to
 
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.109 align:start position:0%
entertaining a motion of an expedient to
legislate

00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.839 --> 00:41:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have to discuss in just a
 
00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:50.790 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have to discuss in just a
second

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
second
okay

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
and represent terry okay and represent
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
johnson you're recognized to speak to
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh the reason for our two pass is when
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
we're making yes being deliberately oh i
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
ita sorry yeah
 
00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.589 align:start position:0%
ita sorry yeah
um

00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
one it's making a
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
a law for a special class which we
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing it's against the law
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this we're going to
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
do it we should be doing it for all
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in new hampshire
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
so across the board we either make it
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay representative bartlett um this is
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
making it for all cosmetic manufacturers
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know i mean our manufacturers period
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
the question you're making it for a
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
specific class of people
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of cosmetics that's that's
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
against constitutional law
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know naturally shaking here the
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
point being is is that is that
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be saying that no testing
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
on animals
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
period regardless of the industry that's
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
doing the testing regardless of the
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
nature of the business
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
should if we're going to ban
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
animal testing
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't why are we only picking on
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
one industry which frankly
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it anyways
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
they don't do it anymore
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying is is that is
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
that you're if if they're not even doing
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
it we have no evidence that anybody's
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually testing on animals at all
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
why would you pick just that one
 
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.630 align:start position:0%
why would you pick just that one
industry

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
rather than
i

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
i would venture to say that uh there are
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of industries that absolutely test
 
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.950 align:start position:0%
a lot of industries that absolutely test
animals

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should come back with an
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that replaces this
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
and puts it for all industries is that
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
what you would prefer i'm i'm not
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
challenging i'm questioning right the
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
the point would be is that if it really
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
were if in terms of her point which is
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
um i i have a different point but that
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
her point is that
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're going to do this you
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
should not be picking out just cosmetic
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
industry you should be saying is we
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
don't want any testing on any animals
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
period in the state of new hampshire and
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
so my question is would you be bringing
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment to rewrite this to make
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
that if we can't get this itl yeah i'll
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
put an amendment in that says we can't
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
so representative bartlett well i think
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
that um i mean one of the things you're
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
looking at is cosmetic industry you're
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
not looking at drugs
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
you're not looking at some you know
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
other kinds of industries that possibly
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
still need to be able to test
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
on animals um this is cosmetics
 
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.630 align:start position:0%
on animals um this is cosmetics
cosmetics

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
cosmetics
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
have a very different use than
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
life-saving drugs
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
for instance and i think that um this is
 
00:44:41.359 --> 00:44:42.230 align:start position:0%
for instance and i think that um this is
a

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know there's been in federal
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
legislation for years it's been bogged
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
down so now they've gone to the states
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
looking for the states to at least make
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
a very minimal
 
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
a very minimal
move

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
to prevent cruelty to animals
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
for an unnecessary reason
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
cosmetics are very different than
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
life-saving drugs
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
and i may i'm willing to make that
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
that concession and that admission
 
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.950 align:start position:0%
that concession and that admission
recognition

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
recognition
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
but i think that that we have
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturers that may still consider
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
and have historically tested their
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
products or ingredients in their
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
products on animals
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
and the feeling has been that it was
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
important to bring this forward they
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
spoke with a lot of stakeholders that
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
felt they could comply with this but we
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
if there are other um
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
plans out there for other companies that
 
00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
plans out there for other companies that
may

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
not do this if the law was not in place
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
so i think it's really important and i
 
00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:42.079 align:start position:0%
certainly will vote against
 
00:45:42.079 --> 00:45:43.030 align:start position:0%
certainly will vote against
um

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
the itl because i think it's an
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
important bill no i i hear you missed it
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative terry yes
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
so just to reiterate uh what we said
 
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday particularly for those uh who
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
are in attendance uh this morning
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
i am unaware of any of the
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
representatives on this committee who
 
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.950 align:start position:0%
representatives on this committee who
are

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
cruelty to animals or um
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
or a human being
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about this particular
 
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about this particular
bill

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
again today
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to thank mr ehrenberg
 
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.190 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to thank mr ehrenberg
for

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
turning around
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
the questions and responding with uh
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
answers uh so quickly
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
i have a copy i don't know if anybody
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
else has a copy of this uh q a thank you
 
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.309 align:start position:0%
else has a copy of this uh q a thank you
sir

00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.190 align:start position:0%
sir
um

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
he addresses specifically the question
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the concern that i raised yesterday
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
and so i'll just read the response for
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
the sake of those who may not have a
 
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.069 align:start position:0%
the sake of those who may not have a
copy

00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
copy
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
the question was how will the law be
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
enforced and particularly to my question
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
has there been enforcement actions or
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
have there been enforcement actions
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
taken in other states or countries where
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is already
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
on the books as a law
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
the response that mr ehrenberg has
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
provided us is as follows quote there is
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
no economic incentive for companies to
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
violate this law as doing so would be a
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
pr nightmare
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
now i underscore in practice enforcement
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
would be complaint driven
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
someone needs to bring a complaint and
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
that would spur an investigation
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
california nevada and illinois laws that
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
have been in effect since january 1st
 
00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.510 align:start position:0%
have been in effect since january 1st
2020.

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
i interject at this point that's more
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
than two years ago
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
continuing and thus far we have not seen
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
any enforcement action that had to be
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
taken we are not aware of enforcement
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
actions taken in other countries close
 
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
actions taken in other countries close
quote

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
quote
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
in other words we have laws on the books
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
in at least three other states
 
00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
for over two years
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
and there have been no complaints filed
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting to me
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
that if we were to enact this bill we
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
are placing in law
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
something that really doesn't need to be
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
in law
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
because we have a record at this point
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
that in the states where the laws have
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
been on the books for over two years
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
there have been no complaints filed and
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
therefore no enforcement actions taken
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
therefore this suggests to me that this
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
is a bill that is unnecessary at this
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
i could argue exactly the opposite of
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
that point the fact is that the bills
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
have been in effect and maybe in fact
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement because people
 
00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:43.839 align:start position:0%
are obeying the bill so i think that's a
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
the other side of the story and i don't
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
see that that's no reason not to have
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
that bill in force thank you
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
 
00:48:53.599 --> 00:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett thank you mr
chair

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.390 align:start position:0%
chair
so

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that we
 
00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:00.829 align:start position:0%
i think it's really important that we
have

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
deterrent um it's difficult for in only
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
two years it's a very short period of
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
time for these bills to have been tested
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
um the other part of it is that there is
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
deterrent it's very it's not easy
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
to determine whether in
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know individual ingredients may have
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
been animal tested um that information
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
takes time to come out but i think that
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
the history
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
of this industry has not been good and
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
they've only been cleaning that up their
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
act by pressure
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
and a law prohibiting them from being
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
able to test on animals
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay here's the reason why i'm opposed
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
to it and that is uh when i got into the
 
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.670 align:start position:0%
to it and that is uh when i got into the
exemptions

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
and the exemptions
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
are unbelievable you can drive a truck
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
through them because theoretically
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
the idea that says well there's no
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
non-animal alternative method or
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
strategy recognized by any federal state
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
in the organization
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
to test safely the cosmetic agree or
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.430 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.710 align:start position:0%
if
the

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that okay so the testing might
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
right that's what the whole list of here
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
there might be okay to do this testing
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's to me that defeats the whole
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
purpose of the legislation then when you
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
have the exemptions that are a whole
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
page long for a statue that's one
 
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.150 align:start position:0%
page long for a statue that's one
sentence

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i think it's very disingenuous to
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
say oh yeah we've we've banned that
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
when you have all these exemptions in
 
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.069 align:start position:0%
when you have all these exemptions in
here

00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
let alone the fact is why are you
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
picking on one industry well because it
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
was an industry that had history
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
but the history that i know today is
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's got on their product we
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't test
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
so it's already the marketplace and this
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
is where i come in
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
the marketplace has already addressed
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
this problem
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody were able to somebody see
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
something that had that animal testing
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
was involved believe you me that would
 
00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
be on the front page of the newspaper
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
so why are we passing this
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
i mean if we went out and passed
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation for every time the
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
marketplace solved the problem we said
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
well afterwards we want you know because
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
we love our puppies i mean this is this
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
a covet puppy problem here you know that
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is the time where we need to you
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
know love give love and care to our dogs
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
i mean come on now this is this this is
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary legislation
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the humane society has made a big
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
effort and want to push this but you
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
know that's that's a cause that they
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
care about i mean i understand but
 
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.069 align:start position:0%
care about i mean i understand but
heck

00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
heck
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
why aren't we worried about all the
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
other stuff i mean we actually did have
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
a bill in this committee
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
it was about antifreeze
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the only reason the building pass
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
was that paul mccachren many recipes
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh offended because we had in it that uh
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
you couldn't uh uh the
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
the company that was manufacturing this
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
special chemical that was putting into
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
the antifreeze
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
wanted exempt wanted to be accepted from
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuits if it actually damaged your
 
00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:25.349 align:start position:0%
lawsuits if it actually damaged your
engine

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
engine
 
00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:26.230 align:start position:0%
engine
okay

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is i'm telling you we all care
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
about dogs we all want to take care of
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
our animals when she made the point to
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
me that well why why are we stopping
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
with just cosmetics and i said well
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's because that's the headline
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's the newspaper line that's what
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
everybody hears about but it's old news
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know and i just don't think we
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
should be cluttering our statutes with
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
things that the marketplace is actually
 
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.470 align:start position:0%
things that the marketplace is actually
resolved

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
no we're in we're you know i mean we
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't take testimony so in subcommittee
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is something i think you can phrase
 
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
i bet you you can phrase what he once
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
would say why this is necessary but
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
in uh in many of the cosmetic products
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
they have sunscreen
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
and some sunscreens are tested on
 
00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.349 align:start position:0%
and some sunscreens are tested on
animals

00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
or they may not be
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
but those that are
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
where would they fall is it a cosmetic
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
is it an ingredient in a cosmetic would
 
00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
it be allowed because it has a history
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
of a use of ingredient but it's been
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
tested on animals you know how how do we
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
know because there are so many
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
there are so many everything from food
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
colorings to fire retardants to all
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of other products get tested on
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
animals for various different reasons
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
some of those may go into cosmetics but
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
they were tested on animals
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
so where does that all fit in this
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay any more discussion on the motion
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
of any speed representative van gaal
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i respect everybody's opinion
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
here and i know that we're not talking
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
about talking against animals that that
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh that we are doing that but we have
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
people from the industry people who have
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
seen from the inside out what's going on
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i respect their opinions and i
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
respect that they're saying that there
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
are still reasons why we need to have
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so i will
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
um i will also vote against the itl for
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
that reason fair
 
00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
that reason fair
enough

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
um i have hunt patusek osborne johnson
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
terry bartlett abel van houten and
 
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.510 align:start position:0%
terry bartlett abel van houten and
mcaleer

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
mcaleer
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
let me just say in conclusion mr
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
chairman what's that with respect to uh
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative van halen's observation
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
at this point sure
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to reconsider this at a
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
point when i'm provided with documented
 
00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.190 align:start position:0%
point when i'm provided with documented
evidence

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh but i don't i don't see any and and
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to not vote today because
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting for evidence if i see
 
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
evidence next year or the year after if
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
i see that enforcement actions haven't
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
been brought in the states where the
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
laws have been adopted i'll take a
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
second look at this but i don't see this
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
right now as you don't thank you okay
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay five to four
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
johnson and terry
 
00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.870 align:start position:0%
johnson and terry
okay

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
next up uh 355 requiring online
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace to disclose certain
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
all right so this is
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
this is still
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
business right this is banking so that's
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
able

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
immaculate

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
immaculate
 
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.710 align:start position:0%
immaculate
okay

00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
i'll make a motion to itl
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative johnson
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
secondly represent terry
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
moves any speed to legislate and
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
doing some more research and looking it
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
over most of these big companies already
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
the mark their market that they you know
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
people that sell on their website the
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
ones that
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
really need the oversight is like
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
facebook marketplace craigslist
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
these other people they can only control
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
how they
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
handle their third
 
00:57:44.799 --> 00:57:45.910 align:start position:0%
handle their third
um

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.510 align:start position:0%
um
third-party

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
third-party
 
00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
third-party
sellers

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
so why do we need a law when they can
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
already do it and then protect the
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
consumers because if you know that
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
someone's going to protect you
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
based on their business model then
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to do more business with
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
them if they're not then you have a
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
choice not to it's consumer beware
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
from

00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:58:06.839 --> 00:58:08.710 align:start position:0%
from
there

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
i would just argue that
 
00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know the threshold is five thousand
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
dollars of sales which isn't a lot uh in
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
sales so there are other marketplaces
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
other than walmart and
 
00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:24.309 align:start position:0%
other than walmart and
amazon

00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
amazon
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
that can't afford to give that
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
protection when they're using these
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers so i think that
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
those companies those
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
consumers need protection there
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
not everybody buys from amazon or
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
this is for new products only so i don't
 
00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
think it usually applies to
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
facebook or craigslist
 
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.390 align:start position:0%
facebook or craigslist
anyway

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
um i think we did have testimony that
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
amazon will stand behind products that
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
they purchase but you also know that
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
when you buy things from amazon
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
occasionally it'll say on the right on
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
the front of it this may be a final sale
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
so you don't have um an option
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
on that one um
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
this only applies to new items
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
this bill only applies to new items
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
you think you were hiding back there
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
that i didn't see you why don't you come
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
up here until you sit on the come up
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
he's from aegis
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
he's not testifying he is a member of
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office consumer
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
protection division that would be in
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
charge with enforcing this statute
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
you turn your bike on
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
without the benefit of having the actual
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill in front of me my memory and
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
confidence is that it applies to new and
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
unused items
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
new and unused items okay in other words
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
did not it's not a used item that you
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
might find on ebay okay all right go
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
ahead confirm continue so i mean that's
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
what that's my point i think that there
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
and when we're the testimony that we
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
heard that we're talking about a a 500
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
billion dollar industry
 
01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.829 align:start position:0%
billion dollar industry
of

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
stolen items
 
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.870 align:start position:0%
stolen items
um

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
that that occur and they're they need a
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
place to be able to fence these if you
 
01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.710 align:start position:0%
place to be able to fence these if you
will

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
and this bill at least would give some
 
01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:44.069 align:start position:0%
and this bill at least would give some
protection

01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
um but fencing item means it would be
 
01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:47.589 align:start position:0%
um but fencing item means it would be
used

01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:48.390 align:start position:0%
used
no

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
fencing doesn't mean they stole it in
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
its original packaging that's right okay
 
01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
they can go into some of these jewelry
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
stores or the
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
the atvs that have been stolen the
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
chainsaws that have been stolen they're
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're bought they're right in the
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
cartons the snowmobiles that have been
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
stolen these are in the cartons that
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
they actually shipped it when they're
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
being stolen and to get to 500 billion
 
01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.470 align:start position:0%
being stolen and to get to 500 billion
dollars

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
that's a heck of a lot of material that
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
they've got to figure out a way to sell
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
and this bill would at least give some
 
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.069 align:start position:0%
and this bill would at least give some
protection

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
um to the consumers that would be
 
01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.150 align:start position:0%
um to the consumers that would be
purchasing

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair and the manufacturers
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative terry then represented
 
01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
representative terry then represented
abel

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
abel
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
so uh rhetorically speaking uh was i not
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
here yesterday and here's the actual
 
01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:37.589 align:start position:0%
here yesterday and here's the actual
question

01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
did i not hear
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
that with respect to
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
the question of final sale
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the concern about final sale
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
that we heard
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
that where there is fraud
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
and deception
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
that those
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
actions come under existing law so that
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
there really is no such thing as a final
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
sale when there is fraud and deception
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
could we just have that reiterated been
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarified if need be please
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
could you clarify what you mean by
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
finding i i i understand the second part
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the question i don't understand the
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
final sale component of it what are you
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
referring to i believe that we have
 
01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.270 align:start position:0%
referring to i believe that we have
discussed

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
together our shared knowledge
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
that sometimes when
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
an amazon or i don't believe walmart but
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
amazon and i've never seen on amazon but
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
let's say hypothetically amazon will
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
indicate that that whatever that the
 
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.029 align:start position:0%
indicate that that whatever that the
sale

01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh that they are
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
the product that's being offered on
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
their platform by a third-party seller
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
that product is uh a final sale
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
so it's unreturnable and you can't get
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
your money back
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
but suppose there's fraud and deception
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
on the part of the third party seller
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
what the concern that i'm hearing is is
 
01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.630 align:start position:0%
what the concern that i'm hearing is is
that

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
final sale means final sale even if
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
there's fraud and deception what i
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
thought i heard yesterday is if you can
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
prove fraud and deception then final
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
sale is not final sale so there is in
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
fact protection under existing consumer
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
protection law
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct or something close to it
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
i think something close to it so close
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
enough in that instance and this was my
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from yesterday
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
if you have a seller regardless of
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's the marketplace or it's a
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
third-party seller who's selling on the
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
marketplace that are making any sort of
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
false or deceptive representations about
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
the product that they're selling it's
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
not an issue of whether it's all sales
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
are final you know because the consumer
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
arguably would not have engaged in the
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
sale to begin with but for the deceptive
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
statement so nobody can hide behind a
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know well all sales are final if
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
they've made deceptive statements and
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
yes that is i believe covered by
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
existing unfair and deceptive acts or
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
does the chair want you to stay here or
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
yes just stay right there thank
 
01:04:10.839 --> 01:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
yes just stay right there thank
you

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative abel
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh thank you for your help
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
as well um
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
does a number of things
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
and to
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
to vote
itl

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
itl
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
would be to take a step that is
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
anti-consumer because it hurts the
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
consumer's ability to get to
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
to deal with this kind of a problem
 
01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:46.870 align:start position:0%
to deal with this kind of a problem
uh

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
from the government point of view from
 
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
from the government point of view from
the

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office that would
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
need to enforce
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
would need to enforce it and would need
 
01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
investigations it makes it much much
 
01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.029 align:start position:0%
investigations it makes it much much
harder

01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
harder
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
the party that has
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
has defrauded someone
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
and thirdly i think it's it's a this is
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
this is to vote for an anti-business
 
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.829 align:start position:0%
this is to vote for an anti-business
position

01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
because the businesses
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
that are acting as the platform
 
01:05:19.039 --> 01:05:19.990 align:start position:0%
that are acting as the platform
um

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
are taking a lot of this this is a big
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
loss for them a big expense for them to
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
these kinds of problems they're in favor
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so i'm surprised actually that
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
my colleagues from the other party are
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
taking a position that will be
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted as both
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
uh both
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
anti-consumer and anti-business and
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's the way i see it so i i'm going
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
to vote against the itl
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
we also had testimony from the new
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire police association that
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
supports the bill strongly so i think
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
that that's also um
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
an important endorsement
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
sitting in the hot seat i appreciate
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
would this legislation
 
01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
would this legislation
cover

01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
facebook marketplace craigslist
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
ebay and those types of
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
of platforms that allow sales
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
understanding it would we we definitely
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
understand it would cover an amazon and
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
a walmart
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
but what about the
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
the facebook marketplace and things like
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:37.990 align:start position:0%
that um
where

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
more than likely the stolen items from
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the smash and grabs are going to find
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
themselves listed because of amazon has
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
quite the scrutiny to be on their
 
01:06:47.039 --> 01:06:49.829 align:start position:0%
quite the scrutiny to be on their
marketplace

01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that
 
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.109 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that
it

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's no yes and there's no no i think
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
that depending on whether this covers an
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
online marketplace that allows
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers who are dealing new
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
and unused merchandise so to the extent
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
that i know you know craigslist i don't
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
spend a ton of time on craigslist but
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the times that i've been on it a lot of
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
the stuff that's being offered are you
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
know private parties selling their used
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
items their personal items that they're
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get rid of so it would not
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
apply to those sales
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
um if there are and i don't know if
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers on craigslist whose
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
business is selling new and unused
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
merchandise through craigslist
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
potentially it could i don't think
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's craigslist's business model i i
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
have to admit i'm very unfamiliar with
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
facebook marketplace i know that
 
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.069 align:start position:0%
facebook marketplace i know that
there

01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
are a high volume of similar private
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
sales of used merchandise on facebook
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
marketplace i'm unaware of whether they
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
have like designated high volume
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers like amazon and like
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
walmart does um but if they did that
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're dealing in new and unused
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
merchandise then i believe it would
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
i just have a question is
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
is a consumer feature but
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
i won't i don't trust facebook and you
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
know i don't go anywhere near it myself
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
so i think we're gonna get this
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
discussion back to the to the bigger
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
picture these are the big
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
operators that are trying to move
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
big thefts
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is this is to
 
01:08:35.839 --> 01:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
and that's what this is this is to
protect

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
so i i guess enforcement to be able to
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
have something with teeth in it
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
but we haven't seen i don't
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have an anecdotal story of
 
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
someone of this really actually
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
occurring in new hampshire well yeah we
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
know about the smashing grass
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've had some big thefts here that are
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
done with organized crime
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and they've got to find a place to
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
sell their stuff when they're taking out
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
truckloads of atvs and chainsaws and
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
these are all in the original packaging
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
they come in they smash it they
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
um have picked it up it's gone twice in
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
manchester one of the atv
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have laws against
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
thievery and organized crime to begin
 
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
thievery and organized crime to begin
with

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
how they're getting rid of their their
 
01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.709 align:start position:0%
how they're getting rid of their their
products

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative police represent
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
that hound let me go ahead thank you um
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're losing sight of another
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
facet of this and that is that
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're closing a door of criminals before
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
the fact we don't have to
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
catch them after the fact and find them
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
i mean as far as i know and i've not
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
lived a criminal life but as far as i
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
know anonymity is the greatest strength
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
of a criminal if i'm going to steal her
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
phone right now i want to do it a non
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
most not
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
without being seen without having my
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
identity compromised and so i think that
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's another facet of this as well
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't only have to worry
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
about criminals after the fact
 
01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
why open doors for them to have that
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
criminality now especially in such large
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
volume as what we're talking about thank
 
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.270 align:start position:0%
volume as what we're talking about thank
you

01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.310 align:start position:0%
you
okay

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
represent back later oh thank you i just
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
remember that this not only protects the
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
consumer but it also protects the
 
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and believe me the
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is very interested in
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
finding out you know who's doing these
 
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
break-ins and taking their stuff so i
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
think we we fail to uh to recognize that
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
as well thank you
 
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.189 align:start position:0%
as well thank you
okay

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann thank you mr
 
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.390 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann thank you mr
chair

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh how would we go about
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh protecting a consumer when the third
 
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.189 align:start position:0%
uh protecting a consumer when the third
party

01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
is in guangzhou china
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
because you buy things on amazon
 
01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.390 align:start position:0%
because you buy things on amazon
marketplace

01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
and the seller it they already list
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
where they're located
 
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
where they're located
and

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
your option is guangxiu china for five
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
bucks or hoboken new jersey for 27
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
which one you're going to buy from
 
01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
and you don't have 27 but you've got
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
five so you buy from guangzhou and now
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
you're toast how
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
how are we going to protect people when
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren thank you
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
i think the answer to that question is
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
that once we find out that that seller
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
is from uh china and somebody's been
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
taken then these the amazons the
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
walmart's they're going to shut them
 
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.669 align:start position:0%
walmart's they're going to shut them
down

01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
so we may have to to wait until a crime
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
has been committed but i think this will
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
this law will prevent
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
those people from we already but they're
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
already doing this now i mean i
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
suggested yesterday that i've i've had
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
issues in the past with a third party
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
seller i've contacted amazon amazon has
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
refunded me the money immediately and
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
said that they were going to undertake
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
an investigation of the third party
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
seller because it's bad business for
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
amazon to continue to have a third party
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
seller selling stuff on amazon if these
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
these uh issues continue to present
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
themselves that reflects badly on the
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
third-party seller they go right after
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
them and terminate them and boom no more
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
on amazon that that's the experience
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sir uh
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
basic question
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
would this feel when it becomes law if
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
it becomes law enable
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
i guess i need you to
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit on that question
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay my my position
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
as chief of the consumer protection
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
bureau yes uh
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
so in what we use you asked enable
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
disable or be neutral
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
in what regard
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
my question i think it would enable him
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to make a phone call and try
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
to make the consumer hold yeah that
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
would certainly enable him to do that
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
this make your job easier
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
is basically enabling
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know if it's as simple as
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
answering that question i don't know
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
that i can answer that exact question um
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
will it make it
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
it would make it easier to identify
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
high volume third-party sellers if the
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
online marketplaces are complying with
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%

on on
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
that would have been affected by this
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislation obviously you don't know
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%

um any uh uh mark you know in internet
 
01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
um any uh uh mark you know in internet
marketplaces

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
marketplaces
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
what the nature of the complaints that
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're that you're hearing is that
 
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.669 align:start position:0%
you're that you're hearing is that
possible

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
what i could
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
almost certainly do
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i were to receive a request to
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
provide information
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
to the study i could compile
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
complaints that we receive in a certain
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
date range against um
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
the known high volume third-party
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
sellers amazon walmart ebay
 
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
and in a redacted capacity removing any
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
identifying information from the
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
consumers speak generally about the
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
nature of what the complaints looked
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
like that would be awesome yes so mr
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
the complaints that you receive against
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
the amazons and walmarts
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
with and with the following question
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
answered did amazon
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
have you have you contacted amazon in
 
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.910 align:start position:0%
have you have you contacted amazon in
walmart

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
walmart
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
etc and they have refused to resolve or
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
they have unsatisfactorily resolved
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
your complaint
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
what i want to what i want to get at
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
here is that we don't have people that
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
are contacting your office
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
about an issue with the third high
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
volume third party seller that haven't
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
attempted initially to resolve the issue
 
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.229 align:start position:0%
attempted initially to resolve the issue
through

01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
the through amazon walmart et cetera
 
01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
the through amazon walmart et cetera
clear

01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
could you ask a more direct i think he's
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
basically saying
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
when you get a call you will follow up
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
with the person to find out whether
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
they've actually attempted to call
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
amazon to assure you know that that the
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
problem that that they're calling you
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
now because they did not get a uh uh a
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
respectful response from amazon or
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
walmart or whatever the the market the
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
the internet provider
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
did not give a response and that's why
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're calling you
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
so our response to complaints depends
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
completely and the facts of the specific
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
complaint we do not have a
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all policy where we will
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
or won't accept a complaint if the
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
consumer has or hasn't done various
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
things we try to look at the facts of
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
every complaint and make the right
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
decision based on what information the
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
consumer is providing
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i can say generally
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
every time a consumer files a complaint
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
against a
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
third-party seller that we would insist
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
or verify that they had contacted amazon
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
or another market but you would you
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
would note if the customer mentions
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
whether they have attempted to
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
notify them what we're trying to get out
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
here is we would like you to
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
discriminate between those complainants
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
who have not contacted
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
amazon walmart
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
and those who have
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
and are reporting to you
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
that they're dissatisfied with what the
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
amazons and walmarts have done
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right what i would suggest is at the
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
point in time where the committee would
 
01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:12.790 align:start position:0%
point in time where the committee would
like

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office through me
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
to come and provide information to send
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
a very specific request for the type of
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
information that you're looking for and
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
that would put us in a position to
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
evaluate the request and come prepared
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
to answer those exact questions if
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's something the attorney general
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
authorizes which i i suspect that he
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
would so if we interim study what you're
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
it was it was discussed i wrote a note
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
here to myself uh from yesterday that
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
the retail association does not see
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
any need to make any modification to
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
despite personal testimony
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting some mechanism
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
and what i don't remember is what that
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism is supposed to be
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
and that's there was some other
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
discussion going on in there but some
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
kind of a mechanism if anybody recalls
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
that from testimony yesterday so maybe
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
this interim study might be able to
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
determine what that mechanism might be
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
the language that i wrote down mr
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh needful of a mechanism
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting a need for a mechanism to
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
identify tps and have that displayed to
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
the consumer that's what that's what
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
the attorney general brings recommended
 
01:21:42.159 --> 01:21:43.750 align:start position:0%
the attorney general brings recommended
okay

01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
so motion clear now it's uh interim
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%

and anybody want to second my motion
 
01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.590 align:start position:0%
and anybody want to second my motion
okay

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative said it you know this is
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
this bill is not ready for prime time
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative van gaal
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um and i agree i will vote for
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
the ito i'm just hoping to clarify i
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
think there was a little bit of
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
confusion when the bill was
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
was uh discussed yesterday
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
the original bill is very different from
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're looking at right now
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're looking right at
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
right now just gives the
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
the owner whether it be a condo or
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
another similar kind of building
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
to go back to the board and bring that
 
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
complaint to the same person and that
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
just seems counterintuitive so if i have
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
an issue with you because you have fined
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
me for something i can get a hearing
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
with you but i don't see that that's
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to be very helpful the mechanism
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
of going to court has always been
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
available and so um with great respect
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and and and i certainly feel for the
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
people who've come i understand their
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
concerns and their needs this is not the
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism to make them whole in the way
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
that they want to be made whole and so i
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
will reluctantly vote itl not because my
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
heart is not with them but because this
 
01:23:50.229 --> 01:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
is not the right way to fix it for them
 
01:23:50.239 --> 01:23:51.669 align:start position:0%
is not the right way to fix it for them
okay

01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
all right is the motion clear
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%

01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%

01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

representative weston scooted me up on

i'll second now
 
01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:22.709 align:start position:0%
i'll second now
okay

01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.390 align:start position:0%
okay
and

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
an excuse to legislate okay and you
 
01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm moving itl because um
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
the evidence was that this bill that
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
will not result in any cost savings for
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
for um for these groups and um that
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
there may be adverse selection in terms
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
of people who choose to be in these
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
groups would be young and healthy and it
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
also looks like they're not going to be
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
getting more than they're getting right
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
now through these association plans
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
and then we have a similar statute
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
already on the books that maybe the
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
number's a little different but it's
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i support the itl
 
01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i support the itl
motion

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:09.970 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:27:09.970 --> 01:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
motion
[Music]

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
anything that we try to do
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
to try to lower costs is going to get
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
preempted by the federal government
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
because anything that would actually
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
you you well if you were trying to pull
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
out mandates
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
well it it's if you try to get a group
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
of people who are
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
of a similar demographic and healthy you
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
can't take them out of the general pool
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
because then that would raise the rates
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
of those who would be of a demographic
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
that would generally be under health if
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
it was a guaranteed issue right and so
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh in any kind of pi and not only that
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
but a pilot program that doesn't last
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
long enough to actually see results
 
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.430 align:start position:0%
long enough to actually see results
uh

01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
in in two years
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
they would call it a success because
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
there were no claims in the third year
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
everybody is filing claims and they
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance now so how do you
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
get them back to a plan that they had
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
beforehand if there was any failure
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism to and i mean
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's already a law that would require
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
them to be covered but how do we know
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
that going back to a previous plan
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't end costing them more
 
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't end costing them more
right

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
right
so

01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.870 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
all right any more discussion on the
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
motion of any speed to legislate seeing
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
none all those in favor please raise
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
your hand one two three four
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
seven

01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
seven

study on senate bill 287
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
and representative bartlett it's
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak to her motion um i
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
just think that there's some um issues
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
with this one i think we've got um
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
pending court case regarding the federal
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
language on it um i think that having it
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
amended back and forth between who
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
should be the referee is not a a good
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's not time to do that i think we
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
should wait
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
until um
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
we figure out what's going to happen
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
with the language
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
on the feds so this can come back

01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay but
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%

01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
i support it because it makes a lot of
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
sense i i don't think you can compare it
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
to you know to
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
distill products or
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
wine because especially distilled
 
01:34:28.719 --> 01:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
wine because especially distilled
because

01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
beer has a lot less you know alcohol um
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
volume to it so i agree i listened to
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
the testimony from
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
um from our liquor commissioner and um
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
he did not testify on this bill well
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
you said commissioner so there's no
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the room right right
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
there with a commission commission
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:34:56.239 --> 01:34:57.669 align:start position:0%
right um
okay

01:34:57.669 --> 01:34:57.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
did we not hear yesterday that with
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
respect to the
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
magic number 27 and the new magic number
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
of 50
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
that no seller is even beginning to
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
one i believe there was one that was
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
that asked oh there was just one and
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
the one is not a member of the
 
01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
the one is not a member of the
association

01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
i think you're right so that this would
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
in effect
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
this is tantamount to a special interest
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill yeah you're right for one and and
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm uncomfortable with that yes i think
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
you remember it correctly uh thank you
 
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
you remember it correctly uh thank you
ma'am

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
i'll remember this is a highlight moment
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
for me thank you
 
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.550 align:start position:0%
for me thank you
okay

01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
all right so motion is i t l represent
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
julio second by representative batusex
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
moves in expedition to the legislature
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
did we not get a second on out to pass
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
is that why we're i we were did we vote
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
it down did we do that we can
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
emotion can be oh i'm sorry motion can
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
be withdrawn i was thinking at the time
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that was yep
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
so i might be yelling
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
so i i would say i have mixed emotions
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
about this bill obviously
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this is uh my pride and
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
joy the statute um
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
first of all i am incredulous
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
that anybody would want to
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
take beer as a direct shipment
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
and pay the eight percent
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
john hunt memorial tax
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
why why would anybody want to pay that i
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
just can't imagine however given this
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
particular because you know this was
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
shutdown wherever he was at home this
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
person obviously decided that that there
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
were people were out there wanting to do
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
it but this this number is about an
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
individual consumer so again
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
i'm incredulous and anybody would
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually take advantage of this
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
of moving this number up and uh on top
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
of that that's the number i agreed to
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
way back when so i i i'd like to be
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
consistent let's say and i see no
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
compelling real reason to change the
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
number so i uh support the unexpected to
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
legislate motion representative van
 
01:37:06.639 --> 01:37:07.750 align:start position:0%
legislate motion representative van
houden

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
houden
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't disagree with any
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
anything that you've said
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
um but i go back to my testimony or to
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
my statements earlier about equity and
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
fairness and and looking at the
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
three-tier system as something that
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
either needs to be protected or
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
dismantled or whatever and that i think
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
we have um as we've said before we've
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
made movements for different for liquor
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
for instance or for beer for instance
 
01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.310 align:start position:0%
for instance or for beer for instance
and

01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
catching up and allowing other other
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
parts of the industry to uh also have
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
those movements in their favor so
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
in heart and soul no i don't agree with
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
this but in terms of my belief that we
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
need to be fair all the way around um i
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
do believe in it
 
01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.109 align:start position:0%
do believe in it
okay

01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:49.119 --> 01:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
since it's not 12 i will respond
 
01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.550 align:start position:0%
since it's not 12 i will respond
um

01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
even before i
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh liquor started coming to commerce
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
when it used to be in regulated revenues
 
01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:02.550 align:start position:0%
when it used to be in regulated revenues
uh

01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
so it's long before anybody in this room
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
maybe aiden was around
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
created uh brew pubs
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
were you around for brew pubs
 
01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
were you around for brew pubs
okay

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
and i am sure at the time somebody
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out that brew pubs are the
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the trampling i mean this is not just
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
stomping this is trampling destroying
 
01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:27.669 align:start position:0%
stomping this is trampling destroying
kicking

01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
kicking
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
of the three-tier system
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
because in that case it violated every
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
element of the three-tier
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
we have a manufacturer who's who's
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
retailing who's selling uh and and
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
distributing uh every you know so at
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
that point we would you could
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
call into question whether
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
how whether we're really committed to
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
the three-tier
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
system the three-tier was a concept
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
that we created obviously at the end of
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
the prohibition
 
01:38:58.639 --> 01:38:59.510 align:start position:0%
the prohibition
and

01:38:59.510 --> 01:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
who knows which is the real three-tier
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
when the state of new hampshire chose to
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
get into the liquor business
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
when you think the three-tier really
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
meant was that you would have
 
01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.750 align:start position:0%
meant was that you would have
distributors

01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
distributors
 
01:39:15.109 --> 01:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
and you and you would have uh retailers
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
which and come to still we don't even
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have that
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
except for one licensee two licensees
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
that were have a special privilege of or
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
able to sell but
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise i i i would never i would
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
never hang my hat on defending or
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
you know premising around the three-tier
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
other than maybe that's the concept we
 
01:39:39.669 --> 01:39:39.679 align:start position:0%
were we were framework we were working
 
01:39:39.679 --> 01:39:40.470 align:start position:0%
were we were framework we were working
from

01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
because as far as i'm concerned the
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
three-tier system
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely went out the window you know
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
even with my direct shipping bill you
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
know there was no three-tier involved
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that's very much the case
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
and i know that there has been a lot of
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
examination of the liquor commission and
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
and the runnings of the of the liquor
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
commission i it is just my hope that we
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
will settle on something that's fair and
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
equitable and that suits the state of
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and continues to bring the
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
types of income
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
safely into our state because as you
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
know many of the stances that i take on
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
liquor have to do with vaping and
 
01:40:16.149 --> 01:40:16.159 align:start position:0%
underage drinking and things of that
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
sort so the word safely is is an operant
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
word for me here too
 
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:21.510 align:start position:0%
word for me here too
so

01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
right now i'm looking at a fairness
 
01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.149 align:start position:0%
right now i'm looking at a fairness
issue

01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
either we have something and we don't
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
have something and again
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
in the scheme of things this is not the
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
biggest bill that we deal with
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh and so i will be voting against the
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the motion otp emotion
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
right now it's
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
inexpl with my preference being otp
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
really okay
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
is the motion clear
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of supporting itl
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
please raise your hands
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
and those opposed
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't see you jane
