okay representative control
 
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair again and thank you
 
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I have brought forth an amendment to
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm hope that everyone has that in
 
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
and the it's an act requiring a deputy
 
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
sheriff to to be appointed as an animal
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigator is what the title
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
says but technically all we're asking
 
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
for is that one person in the Sheriff's
 
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.510 align:start position:0%
for is that one person in the Sheriff's
Department

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
take a course
 
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
and be trained in animal cruelty
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
and yes they would be the point person
 
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
if the sheriff's department chose to do
 
00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 align:start position:0%
be part of an animal cruelty
 
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
investigation but it is not mandatory
 
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
the key thing here is the second section
 
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
where it says that all municipalities in
 
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
the county shall notify
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
the animal cruelty investigator at the
 
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office of any case involving
 
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
cruelty or violence against animals
 
00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 align:start position:0%
right now we have no reporting
 
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to understand how many
 
00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases are going on in this state
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
and I think this would be a step forward
 
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
there are 83 towns and cities and
 
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities that actually have Animal
 
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
Control Officers
 
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
the other over 250 do not
 
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
this past summer
 
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents made a complaint
 
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
about some horses that were being
 
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
their only course of action was to call
 
00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
the police department who absolutely had
 
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
no idea what they were looking at or
 
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.009 align:start position:0%
no idea what they were looking at or
understood

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
what a sick animal looks like as one
 
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
person will tell you I mean our my own
 
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
Sheriff has said I can look at a cow and
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
I think they're all sick so
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
he would not be a good person to be
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
looking at animals
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
but if we had someone trained in this
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
and we had somewhere where the local and
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement could go to for a
 
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
resource or ask a question
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
what happened was is these horses
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
as you all know we had some pretty hot
 
00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
temperatures this past summer well over
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
the 90s
 
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 align:start position:0%
I had a person who is has known grown up
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
with horses all her life complaining and
 
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
complaining and complaining and finally
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
she called me because she didn't feel
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
like she was getting anywhere she called
 
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
the state vet's office she called the
 
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture she called the
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement finally
 
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
made an appointment to go out and see
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 align:start position:0%
they also schedule an appointment with
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
the state facts
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
to come out and look at the animals
 
00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
well in the meantime between law
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the state vet
 
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.170 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the state vet
appointment

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
they move the horses to another area
 
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
that they thought they could stay in and
 
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
they in the local law enforcement said
 
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
you know what this issue is resolved two
 
00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
days later
 
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
and they canceled the state vets
 
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
appointment two days later those horses
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
it took another two weeks before the
 
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
state vet's office could get out there
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
because of the canceled appointment
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
I talked to the sheriff he goes there's
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
the local police department did what
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
they thought was best and they were
 
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 align:start position:0%
trying to do what was right for the
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
animals but they did not do not
 
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
understand the laws for animal cruelty
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
they do not do not understand what to
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
look for
 
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about putting an animal
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
control officer at the sheriff's
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
department I don't want them going after
 
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
stray dogs and this that and the other
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
thing we're talking cruelty there aren't
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
that many cruelty cases in this state
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
well there are a lot more than there
 
00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
but the number is manageable but if we
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
had someone as a resource
 
00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 align:start position:0%
for those 250 plus towns
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
cities municipalities
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
some of these things might not fall
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
through the cracks the other thing is is
 
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
the reporting mechanism here
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
is really important we need to
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
understand what we're looking at we
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
can't fix a problem that we can't
 
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.469 align:start position:0%
can't fix a problem that we can't
quantify

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
quantify
 
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives are there any
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
questions I see lots of questions
 
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative let's start down that end
 
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative priest thank you Mr
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
question what do you envision this
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
training to be and how long and it would
 
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
take to get the officer up to speed
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
about what to look for for cruelty in
 
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.590 align:start position:0%
about what to look for for cruelty in
animals

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
animals
 
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative priest for
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh the question
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
um the commission the governor's
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
Commission on the Humane treatment of
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
animals they are working on with police
 
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
standards on some of that it's probably
 
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
a two-week course so it's not a ton of
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
time invested but the key with the
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department is they actually
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
are deputized
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
so which is different we're an animal
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
control officer is not so that's why we
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
don't they can really go get involved
 
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative yukela
 
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.490 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.089 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:36.650 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like your testimony is that
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
there is currently no
 
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.529 align:start position:0%
there is currently no
no

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
no
um

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
no training available that they're
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
developing it currently and so
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's so we're not sure of the voluntary
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
once the training is available the
 
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.990 align:start position:0%
once the training is available the
voluntary

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
00:07:59.809 --> 00:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
um attendance at such training
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
um so is
 
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
um do you think that this is
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
um the right time for a mandate that
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
they go to that training
 
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.629 align:start position:0%
they go to that training
um

00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
um so I can tell you that in January
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
there were two separate Fridays where
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
there was online training uh one dealing
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
with the legal portion of it and the
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
other one dealing with enforcement so
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
there is training that has been
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
developed and at one time it was being
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
taught but it's not mandatory uh
 
00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:43.630 align:start position:0%
taught but it's not mandatory uh
currently

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
um rsa6 what did I say six
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
forty four eight Roman 4 A1 as we go
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
through the all the subsections there's
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
just one phrase in there when it comes
 
00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:05.339 align:start position:0%
to cruelty to animals where it says an
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
animal confiscated by the arresting
 
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:10.019 align:start position:0%
officer so I assume if there's a problem
 
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
in my town I call the police department
 
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
because I think there's an issue there's
 
00:09:15.769 --> 00:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
an arresting officer who follows the
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
statute I just I'm curious about the uh
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
the working relationship between this
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
person and and that arresting officer
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand what that
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
would be or if any uh thank you for the
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
question representative the reason we it
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
was the original Bill there was some
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
confusion and there seemed to be a lot
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
of people weren't happy with it because
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
it was stepping on toes
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say that the sheriff's
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
department has to be involved they the
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
local arresting officer can ask the
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department to get involved but
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's not mandatory okay
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
um so last term we had a bill about
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Officers
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
um about a case of
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
there is a town with an elected Animal
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
control officer Danville specifically
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
and that hearing um
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
revealed to us that apparently there are
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
um in some towns some there's some
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
confusion about the separation of Duties
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
between Animal Control Officers and
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
the police departments and I'm wondering
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
if could you tell us a bit about how
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
exactly this bill
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
might affect that
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher this does not
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with municipalities
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
this is only a tool if the
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities so choose and if the
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department deems they will
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with local law
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement or the local animal control
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
officer if they deem that it is
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
necessary for them to step in they can
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
choose too and as I said the animal
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigator at the sheriff's
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
department would be deputized so if they
 
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
had to arrest or issue things that
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
something separate most Animal Control
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
offices are not deputized and cannot do
 
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.130 align:start position:0%
offices are not deputized and cannot do
that

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
um representative Manchester Puti
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:11:38.889 --> 00:11:38.899 align:start position:0%
have two-part question one is the
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
amendment completely replaces the
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:11:49.009 --> 00:11:49.019 align:start position:0%
including the title correct
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
and secondly the training that you're
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
talking about does it exist in one form
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
or the other in the state or outside
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
around other states that is specific to
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
representment so one yes this replaces
 
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:14.180 align:start position:0%
the original Bill there was some
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussion in some angst on the part of
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
sheriffs and local law enforcement and
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Officers in the original
 
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
Bill thus the the amendment brought
 
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.930 align:start position:0%
Bill thus the the amendment brought
forth

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
as far as the training I know there has
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
been training in the state
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
at the police standards and I believe
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
it's trying to be implemented again
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
um I think with this coming forward it
 
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:46.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:49.820 align:start position:0%
representative treeleven
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
I chatted with uh one of your
 
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors before the hearing today and
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
I asked him and I'm just going to ask
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
you the same thing this person who's
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
going to be deputized will this be the
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
only thing they do in the sheriff's
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
department or will they have other
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
duties not deputized trained excuse me I
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
use the wrong word thank you for the
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
question representative uh no they would
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
just be trained in this thank you
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative service
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:25.740 align:start position:0%
question my question has to do with the
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
last sentence in the amendment lines 12
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
and 13 where it says all municipalities
 
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
in the county shall notify the animal
 
00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigator of any cases
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
involving animal cruelty or violence
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
against animals
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what that means what are the
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements because it's not
 
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
a May it's a shall so what's what is the
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism here and how is it enforceable
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative Davis right now there are
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
no reporting that people are supposed to
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
report into and I don't know the name of
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
the database it's not happening
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
okay so we're trying to get a handle on
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
what's actually going on in this state
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
and there is a difference between a
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
um and I think
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
cruelty is defined somewhere in statute
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know the the RSA number
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head and I think so
 
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
this would just give each County one
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
place to report to instead of reporting
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
to you know this place in this place and
 
00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
that way we would be able to handle and
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
get an idea of what's going on in our
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
state and where the issues are because
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if everyone under
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
understands animal cruelty isn't always
 
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
cruelty it's you could is attributed
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes to mental health issues for
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
and that's how a lot of these animal
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases come about is because of
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Keller
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
question so I have
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
um I'll have a number of them but the uh
 
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
is it your testimony today that there is
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
some training which has been approved by
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
the police that is currently approved by
 
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
the police standards and training uh
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
Council relative to Alamo quality as
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
required by your bill
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question representing
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
your color and I want to say yes but I'm
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
not positive and I will double check
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
into that I know there was training like
 
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
I said I was invited to the online
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
training this past January there were
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
two Fridays that it was done there is
 
00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
the person uh so I know that it was
 
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
there was training at one point at the
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
one follow-up representative yokella
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's actually a new question
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
um the the uh
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
as far as the uh enforcement what if
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
what if no one actually takes the
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
training then
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
nothing happens so so it's voluntary
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
training now and since there's no
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism in this it would
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
also essentially be voluntary after this
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes there is
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
representative uh Caleb
 
00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
clarify here you're saying this is a
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary program but I'm seeing right
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
here in the language of the bill in line
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
9 the sheriff shall appoint a deputy
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
officer and I'm also seeing shall be
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
required to complete the training so if
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's voluntary shouldn't the language be
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
May okay thank you for the question
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill and I think what I
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
was trying to say to representative
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
yokella was even though the RSA that we
 
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
were trying to pass says shall there is
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
no enforcement mechanism or no penalty
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
if they don't
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think that was the question that he
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
so technically if they didn't follow
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
what we did they would not be following
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
one final question representative Kelly
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you thank you for the
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
question or for taking the question
 
00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:39.770 align:start position:0%
question or for taking the question
um

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
this law came into effect 60 days
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
after passage
 
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
after passage
um

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.409 align:start position:0%
um
would

00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
all of the sh if and the um training is
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
not currently available or even if it
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
was currently available
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
um would everyone all of this this
 
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
training need to happen and the
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
appointment need to happen prior to the
 
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
enactment of the bill or is there some
 
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
time frame that you're thinking between
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
the enactment of the bill and some
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
you know Judgment of you know this this
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
sheriff is not following the law
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
upon the passage of the bill
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
the deputy the sheriff would have to
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
appoint someone they would have to
 
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
appoint someone
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
or designate someone to be the animal
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigator in that office
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that person it doesn't say that they
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
have to complete the training in 60 days
 
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
it just says shall be required to
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
complete in-person training
 
00:18:52.559 --> 00:18:55.370 align:start position:0%
complete in-person training
so

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.010 align:start position:0%
so
yes

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your test what thank
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony we have a very
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
long list of speakers and uh the
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
chairman has once again underestimated
 
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
the time for this bill so
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Compton we
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of speakers anybody who
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
intends to speak on the pink cards
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
strict three minute limit uh when you
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
see Vice chairman power hold up the card
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
that means you have 30 seconds to go
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
we'd ask that you'd be brief uh
 
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
non-repetitive and uh so we can get
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
through this hearing thank you next we'd
 
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:40.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
name is Peter Bixby uh Stratford
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
District 613 Dover and uh I will be
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
fairly brief I think that representative
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
covered uh the the meat of the issue
 
00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.130 align:start position:0%
covered uh the the meat of the issue
um

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that uh I'd like to
 
00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
add to what she said it's important to
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
recognize that the State Department of
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
Agriculture does not have any
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement capacity for animal cruelty
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
cases the enforcement capacity is all
 
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:17.780 align:start position:0%
with local law enforcement and uh it's
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh when you have a small town that has a
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
very small Police Department
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's unlikely that there are going
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
to be people who are trained in this
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
specific uh aspect of law because it
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
doesn't come up very often there are a
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
small number of animal cruelty cases uh
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
each year uh and they tend to happen in
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
Fairly disparate places so there's not
 
00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.299 align:start position:0%
likely to be much experience in the
 
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
department and dealing with it so having
 
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:51.140 align:start position:0%
someone at the county level who uh
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
understands how the animal cruelty
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
statute works and how uh how these cases
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
go about and what needs to be considered
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
for them isn't it would be a very
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
important resource I
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
um discussed this uh briefly when we
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
were proposing the bill last uh last
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
fall with uh Sheriff Brave in Stratford
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
County and he said he thought that he
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
thought this was a really good idea that
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's something that he would be happy to
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
have his department on do as a support
 
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
for the municipalities uh another uh
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
there was a question about training one
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
aspect of that training is there there's
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
a Governor's Council on the Humane
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
treatment of animals which has produced
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
as an extensive guidebook on how uh the
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty laws work and how they
 
00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
need to be uh and how they can how they
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
um executed and that guidebook is
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
available for police training
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
um I I assume that that's something that
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
is used by the police training and
 
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
standards uh in their course for
 
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
standards uh in their course for
officers

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.130 align:start position:0%
officers
um

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
another thing to that's important to
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
um emphasize is that most of the animal
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases in the state are a matter
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
of neglect and it can stem from mental
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
illness people with hoarding disorders
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
it can stem from people who think
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
they're doing the right thing for
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
animals and uh but don't realize what
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
they've gotten into and end up uh not
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
realizing that they are mistreating The
 
00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
Animals by not providing what the
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
animals need
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
there are very few cases of active uh
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
choices to hurt animals but there are a
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
number of people who are not uh who
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
don't realize that what they're doing
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
isn't in the best interest of the
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
animals and having someone in the county
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
who officers can use as a resource to
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
figure out how to go about dealing with
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
that is would be a great Advantage for
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
the animal population in the state and
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
for the animal owners in the state and
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'll I'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned
 
00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.649 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned
um there's

00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
um there's
 
00:23:18.169 --> 00:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
cases in the state do you have actually
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
a number of cases of cruelty to animals
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
I I don't have the current statistics
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that uh this bill
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
will do will is actually make it
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
possible to establish those statistics
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
more firmly I know that uh in the course
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
of my uh term on environment and
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
agriculture we have had a number of
 
00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
bills come forward in order to improve
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
our animal cruelty laws which we have
 
00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
been gradually working on uh and
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh some of these cases have been very
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
high profile like the one in Wolfeboro
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
uh there is also one um and I'm
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
forgetting one of the towns near between
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and yeah and Keane I don't
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
remember I mean quit which one it was
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
right right now but cases involving you
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
know uh between 25 and 100 animals who
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
are not being well cared for uh those
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
were high profile ones there are other
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
ones I'm sure the State Vet can you know
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
has a list of ones that he's been called
 
00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
in on but uh it is something that
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
happens regularly but not uh in vast
 
00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.250 align:start position:0%
happens regularly but not uh in vast
numbers

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
representative of your color
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.930 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.010 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
you said that there's
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
um not a lot of these cases in this
 
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.190 align:start position:0%
um not a lot of these cases in this
state

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
um so why choose that the um the
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
training that be shifted to the county
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
level instead of just having a go-to
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
person at the State Police level and
 
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and uh have that be this the point
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
person because the uh law indicates that
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
the uh enforcement of these statutes
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
happens at the municipal level
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
so there needs to be the municipalities
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative yakella one follow-up
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
please thank you
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
since the since the um the enforcement
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
is happening at the at the uh Municipal
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
level and this person is just going to
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
be a resource wouldn't that resource
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
also be available if that person was at
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
the State uh police level
 
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.409 align:start position:0%
the State uh police level
and

00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:53.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure well I'm not entirely sure
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
why the sponsor chose to that that
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a question for
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative in terms of why she chose
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the county level rather than the
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
state level but my my inclination and I
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
would if if I were the prime sponsor on
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
this I would have done a little bit more
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
research in terms of that but what I
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
what I didn't do what I did do in terms
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
of research was I spoke with uh my local
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff and uh he said this is something
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
in today's newspaper where I live in
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
Lebanon there's a very long story about
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
a case of animal neglect and cruelty
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
where people called office after office
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
after office and we're told we're not
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
responsible we're not responsible we're
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
not responsible even though the title of
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
those offices was prevention of animal
 
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.390 align:start position:0%
those offices was prevention of animal
cruelty

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
cruelty
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
do you see a similar kind of round-robin
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
situation happening in New Hampshire and
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
is that one of the reasons that this
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill was brought forth
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes uh the the the capacity to have uh
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
one designated resource in the county
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
that can work with both local law
 
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement to help them do things
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
correctly would really help in a lot of
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty cases uh because the
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
local officers are doing a lot of
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
different things and being trained in
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
this is pretty low on their list because
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
it only comes up once you know in a in a
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
given Community it might not come up for
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
you know like 20 or 30 years in a row I
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
it it so there's not a base of of
 
00:27:48.409 --> 00:27:48.419 align:start position:0%
experience at if there's someone at the
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
county level it does come up you know
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
more frequently in in counties than in
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
specific towns just because of
 
00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
probabilities so that person would also
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
be able to have a broader range of
 
00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:05.529 align:start position:0%
be able to have a broader range of
experience

00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:05.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
oh follow up
 
00:28:09.409 --> 00:28:09.419 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:09.419 --> 00:28:11.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
in the process of of putting the bill
 
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
together was the sheriff's Association
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
consulted and and how are they are they
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the words shall I'm
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
going to interrupt um we have our next
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
speaker will be from the sheriff's
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
Association so we'll hold that question
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
okay well I'm glad that I I was going to
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
say I don't know so
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
um that's uh easily solved thank you
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Manchester
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for taking my
 
00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:45.860 align:start position:0%
question my question is you talked about
 
00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
large-scale high-profile animal cruelty
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
cases but does this address at an
 
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
individual level more and more people
 
00:28:58.730 --> 00:28:58.740 align:start position:0%
have animals for their emotional seeing
 
00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:01.820 align:start position:0%
eye guiding you know for so many things
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
would this address in those situation if
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
the animal cruelty or neglect exists it
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
it would it would be a an available
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
resource for any sort of animal cruelty
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
uh just to be clear
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
almost all animal owners in the state of
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire treat their animals well
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
it is a rare thing that something that
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
when it goes awry and uh but uh when it
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
does go awry it is the duty of the local
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
police to be the first uh people to look
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
at it and they often need help
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby thank you
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
don't say either
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
hi good morning chairman members of the
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Elizabeth Sargent I
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
work for the infinity Capital group here
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
in Concord I'm here today representing
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Sheriff's Association
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
I did not intend to speak on this bill
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
today I was going to be listening taking
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
some notes and getting back to them with
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
where representative was headed I did
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
not have an opportunity to speak with
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
her the sheriff's Association I do know
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
that I was just told the sheriff Wright
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
did see this amendment the sheriff's
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
Association in total they just haven't
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment so I can't comment on
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
it I'm happy to take back any concerns I
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
know I received a florea female from
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
several of the 10 high sheriffs that
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
they did have concerns about this bill
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
they do have the invest The Authority
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
they can investigate these cases now
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
they normally act as a resource for the
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
local police departments and I will add
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
I also represent the New Hampshire
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police they
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
were watching this bill they did not
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
weigh in they thought it was going to be
 
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
a county bill well so we do have some
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
questions I probably don't know the
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
answers but I'm happy to take all of
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
this information back I'll get the
 
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:15.299 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative com toy
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I will get back to the committee
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
they did have some initial concerns for
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative priests
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman one of the
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have is again it's the
 
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
training and I really don't see the
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
problem you know in training the
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
officers to see the cruelty so sure I
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
would love to have their input on that
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I just emailed the director at
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
police standards and training and to ask
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
him if there is training in place so I
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the questions we
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative you occult yes another
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
question I I would like
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
um some some feedback on is if they have
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
concerns about the shifting of the cost
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
of this to the to the um local uh or the
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh county level in where it may be able
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
to be handled at the state level in the
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
state bear bear the cost of that
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
training so a couple of the responses I
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
did receive from sheriffs did mention
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
that cost could be a concern yes thank
 
00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:21.049 align:start position:0%
that cost could be a concern yes thank
you

00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you I
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
look forward to the information sure uh
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
sure guys stand up
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
my name is Nancy Holmes and I'm here
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
today from New Boston New Hampshire
 
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
could you do me a favor and pull that
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
mic closer to you oh sure I think
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'll start over again my name's
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
Nancy Holmes I'm here today from New
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
Boston New Hampshire and why overall
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
support the concept of this bill I have
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
a problem with one small part of it
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
which I don't think anybody's going to
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
much like because it would expand the
 
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.130 align:start position:0%
much like because it would expand the
cost

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
but I looked at this bill and I thought
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
you're putting all of this on one person
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
within the sheriff's department one
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
Deputy one person is not always
 
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.970 align:start position:0%
Deputy one person is not always
available

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
you know does this mean people are going
 
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
to have to wait days or weeks or
 
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
whatever while somebody comes back from
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
doing whatever they are doing
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
to be available to be that resource
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
the other side of it is is animal
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigation is extremely
 
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.389 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigation is extremely
stressful

00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
stressful
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
people who tend to take on that role
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
like animals and dealing with the things
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
that people do to animals whether it be
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
out of the neglect or on purpose say
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
with dog fighting those kind of things
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
you know they can take a toll on a
 
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.430 align:start position:0%
you know they can take a toll on a
person

00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
assigning only one person to be the
 
00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:21.260 align:start position:0%
trained person to understand the the
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
issues and to handle all the input
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
coming in maybe from different towns
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
within the county I think is overdoing
 
00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:33.260 align:start position:0%
it I think one is not enough
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and if you want to have have the
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department be a resource this
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
should be more than one person maybe
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
even all the deputies are able to share
 
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:45.500 align:start position:0%
the burden and allow the person
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
who is dealing with whatever cruelty
 
00:34:51.649 --> 00:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
case it is to have some peer support in
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
you know in their job and handling this
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I know that law
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement often deals with stressful
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
situations but I think adding one more
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
and saying oh just you you are the one
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
who are going to have to do that and one
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I thought this is uh I
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
worked for a very large bank and I
 
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
became the alternate one person to
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
handle any major issues with their
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
computer systems unfortunately the
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
person who is the main person became
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
immediately unavailable after five
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
o'clock every night so I was on call
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
nights weekends vacations you know out
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
sick did not matter I was the person and
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's very stressful to be in that role
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
and have all the responsibilities stuck
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
on you
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
um and I I really do believe that even
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
though training is costly there's always
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
an advantage to have better trained law
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel and I think that
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
expanding the training to more than one
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
person Per County would be better the
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I know there's been a lot of
 
00:35:58.430 --> 00:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether it would be
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
good at the state level versus at the
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
county level I'm thinking the county
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
level people would have a better grasp
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
on what's going on in their County the
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
players in the different towns and the
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
police forces and so on this damn sure
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
the states police could do this but I'm
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
I think the county level
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
um just might add extra insight into the
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
any issues that come up be happy to take
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
um so just to be clear
 
00:36:34.569 --> 00:36:34.579 align:start position:0%
so is this
 
00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:36.130 align:start position:0%
so is this

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:36.140 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
the the Rand testimony says Ash written
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
but there's an amendment here so are you
 
00:36:44.569 --> 00:36:44.579 align:start position:0%
speaking to the bill s ridden or the
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
amendment of it as it turned out the um
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
bills kept that one person in the
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
amendment so I got to glance through the
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
amendment rapidly and I saw yep still
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
got one person that the county level is
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for this and uh
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that's um I think
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's pushing it you really need more
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
than one resource thank you
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you for
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate Grace for the
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
municipal Association I uh we don't have
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
a position on the original bill
 
00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I saw the amendment this morning and
 
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:39.180 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to comment
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
um that we are concerned that the
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
amendment the last line of that about
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities would place the burden on
 
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.430 align:start position:0%
municipalities would place the burden on
municipalities

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
my preference would be the last line of
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
the original bill which places the
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
burden on the county
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and I know that the county sheriffs
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
will object to that I don't have to
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
consult them on it
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
um but uh realistically I think the last
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
line of the original Bill uh details
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
kind of the role of of what
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
um the the relative parties will do here
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit better in addition to
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
placing the burden on someone other than
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
who I represent
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
um but that also clarifies what the role
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
is there rather than
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
having the potential as Representatives
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
Davis said of you know having having uh
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
persons notified who would presumably be
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
in charge of doing these type of
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
Investigations but maybe not providing
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
that that same support it provides a
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
clear Mandate of here you're if you're
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
going to get this training you're also
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to be responsible for doing this
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
kind of Investigation in this type of
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
type of offense
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
um and and one other thing to highlight
 
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.930 align:start position:0%
um and and one other thing to highlight
is

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
um the last line of the amendment isn't
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
quite clear on when municipalities
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
should report to uh the county what's
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
what's happening if it's after charges
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
are brought that could be under the
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty statute RSA 644 colon 8
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
which would either be a misdemeanor that
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
would presumably be handled at the The
 
00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
Local District Court so by the local
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
police department or a felony which has
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
already held handled by the county
 
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
attorney's office so there's kind of a
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
built-in bill built-in notification
 
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
there but they're a whole number a whole
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
list of other
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
animal related offenses under RSA
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 644 colon 8 and I'm not going to
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
list those because it's like 20 offenses
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony seeing no
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you called final uh
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
speaker Kurt Ehrenberg
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
and Mr Ehrenberg when you start could
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
against you did not mark it off I'm
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
sorry my name is Kurt Ehrenberg I'm in
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill I'm the state director
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the Humane Society of the United
 
00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.390 align:start position:0%
of the Humane Society of the United
States

00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
I also serve on the governor's
 
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
Commission on the Humane treatment of
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
animals though I'm not here to represent
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
that body
 
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.930 align:start position:0%
that body
um

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's been plenty said in questions
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
we believe that there is a need for more
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
scrutiny in this state particularly in
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
more rural
 
00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:28.690 align:start position:0%
more rural
less

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:28.700 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
well-served by law enforcement areas
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
in the state for more
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
attention to be paid to animal cruelty
 
00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:42.589 align:start position:0%
attention to be paid to animal cruelty
um

00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
this goes
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
some ways to addressing that issue
 
00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
so we do support that and I'm happy to
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony uh
 
00:40:57.359 --> 00:40:58.990 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony uh
representative

00:40:58.990 --> 00:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
does this bill go far enough in other
 
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.329 align:start position:0%
does this bill go far enough in other
words

00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:09.050 align:start position:0%
words
um

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
to include a reporting requirement or
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
mandate you know regulations that govern
 
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.010 align:start position:0%
mandate you know regulations that govern
how

00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is going to work well I've learned
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
something I've learned is I would do not
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
want the perfect to be the enemy of the
 
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
good here this bill goes a long way in
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
creating a
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
one person in each County who by the way
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of training I think it's
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
explicit in the amendment that the it is
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
a deputy sheriff
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
so they're already fully trained in law
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be a deputy sheriff in
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
that in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of training for sorry to get
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
sidetracked but I think this is
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
important training for
 
00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty investigations there are
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
trainings that could be Avail available
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
my organization Humane Society the
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
United States offers Law Enforcement
 
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.089 align:start position:0%
United States offers Law Enforcement
Training

00:42:13.089 --> 00:42:13.099 align:start position:0%
Training
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is there is readily
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
available uh not that complicated
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh could certainly spell it out
 
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.210 align:start position:0%
uh could certainly spell it out
somewhere

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
um so dance and I'm sorry I got
 
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.630 align:start position:0%
um so dance and I'm sorry I got
sidetracked

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
sidetracked
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to continue or get back to
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
where we gives me representative state
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:35.339 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
my concern has to do with how this bill
 
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.990 align:start position:0%
my concern has to do with how this bill
might

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:44.540 align:start position:0%
contradict existing law in New Hampshire
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
which currently says
 
00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.670 align:start position:0%
which currently says
that

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
complaints pertaining to the abuse of
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
animals shall initially be filed with
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
the local law enforcement agency
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say at the
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
request of the local law enforcement
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
agency Animal control officer State
 
00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
Police or Sheriff the state veterinarian
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
shall assist in a secondary capacity my
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
concern is that the language in the
 
00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
directly contradicts what is in existing
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
law in terms of the order of reporting
 
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative stavis was that a
 
00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:28.370 align:start position:0%
representative stavis was that a
question

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
well do you do you share that concern I
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
I have not had that concern but I had
 
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:37.740 align:start position:0%
not it had not been brought to my
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:46.140 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that we run into an
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
issue here because
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
the intent of this if nothing else is
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities
 
00:43:59.329 --> 00:43:59.339 align:start position:0%
would would be aware that there was some
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
oversight that they would be needing to
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
report anything and I would hope that it
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
either amended or construed that
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
any cruelty case being investigated by a
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
municipality would be reported up to
 
00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:18.740 align:start position:0%
this investigator so there was some
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
database there was some place where that
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
was being collected on the county level
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
which there is a need in this state for
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
more of this data collection
 
00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.370 align:start position:0%
more of this data collection
um

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
well no just to say there are cities and
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
towns that handle these cases extremely
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
well and there are places that need a
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
lot of help
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm over here
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned the
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
fact that there are many towns smaller
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
towns and so forth that are in a greater
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
need than some of the larger cities that
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:08.150 align:start position:0%
we have
um

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
the focal point of the law seems to be
 
00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:16.220 align:start position:0%
on the local municipalities
 
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:20.660 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is in a lot of
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities particularly in the North
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
Country there is no local law
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement the law enforcement is left
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
to the county
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
and how would and I'm I'm in favor of
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
this effort how would the fact that
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's no local law enforcement
 
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.069 align:start position:0%
there's no local law enforcement
uh

00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
not being an expert
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
but having some knowledge of how it
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
works I think that we
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
we rely on the state police to be the
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement in city in the
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
towns where there aren't there are no
 
00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:03.589 align:start position:0%
towns where there aren't there are no
resources

00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry this is in the way
 
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so it would be up to the state police
 
00:46:11.089 --> 00:46:11.099 align:start position:0%
I guess to do that along with whatever
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
the governing body of the town would be
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as the state
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
director for the
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
um for your organization you've seen the
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
number of cases of Cruelty in these
 
00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
small towns how many of those go
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
I can't quantify that for you but I
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
believe that there are more than we
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
just the number probably
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to get into it it's it
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
my question my question is
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
during covet and the more animals were
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
adopted and then this you know has the
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
cases of abuse neglect
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
uh animal cruelty has it increased from
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
your uh perspective where it is your
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
Humane Society
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably in something I
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
should be able to answer I don't know I
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative McDonald
 
00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm from up in
 
00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
Wolf bro so I'm familiar with the great
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
Dame case
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
how would this proposed law make that a
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
so I was not in this position during
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
that period of time so I'm familiar with
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
it but I was not the state director at
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
the time just to say that
 
00:47:58.859 --> 00:48:01.490 align:start position:0%
the time just to say that
um

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.109 align:start position:0%
 
because

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:05.339 align:start position:0%
Chief Rondo and Wolfeboro is an
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
exemplary uh example an example example
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
of uh law and how law enforcement should
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
act in these cases
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I wish you were here but I think what
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
he would tell you is that
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
he was surprised and under you know
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
totally overwhelmed by this for the case
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll get into what that was
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
it was a number of great number of Great
 
00:48:30.839 --> 00:48:32.089 align:start position:0%
it was a number of great number of Great
Danes

00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
Danes
 
00:48:32.099 --> 00:48:33.349 align:start position:0%
Danes
um

00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
and that this would have been a great
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
resource to him to have a someone he
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
could go to immediately with a uh this
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
law in place that would spell out that
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
this was the procedure
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
just to this small extent I think it
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%

owner of a duplex I live in one side I
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
rent the other makes me an owner
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
occupied piece of property with less
 
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
than four units
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure as you know units with four
 
00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:47.180 align:start position:0%
or less are treated differently than
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
multi-families or apartments with five
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
or more by the uh by Hud and very
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
commonly in New Hampshire RSA one of the
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
things that the city of Manchester
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
requires if you're going to be a
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
landlord it's thing called a COC it's
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
certificate of compliance every three
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
years they come through and they inspect
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
your property that you're renting
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
um and the issue they charge you a 200
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
fee and they issue a certificate
 
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:14.220 align:start position:0%
basically saying this property is um is
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
good to rent uh I have my own personal
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
issues with that I'm not here to address
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
us the actual CLC structure itself today
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that did stun me
 
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
being a first-time landlord in the state
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
of man of New Hampshire in Manchester
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
was they insisted on inspecting the unit
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I live in and that that would to me
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
was a gross violation when the inspector
 
00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
came and let me start by saying the
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
inspector was extraordinarily
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
professional he was very personal I have
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
no issues with the way he conducted
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
himself while he was there his name was
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
inspector Knight he was wonderful he was
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
doing something I have a philosophical
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
disagreement with but he did an
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
excellent job so this isn't about him
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
this isn't about his performance he did
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
he was very wonderful we actually talked
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
about me being a state rep for some time
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
but when I asked him uh why I understood
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
why he had to inspect the tenant side
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
that made sense right don't want to be a
 
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
slumlord but when I asked him why he had
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
to inspect my side he said something to
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
me that was very troubling and which was
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
what sponsored this idea which he said
 
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:18.420 align:start position:0%
well you could rent this side
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
um and the problem with that argument is
 
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
you could make that argument about
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
literally any piece of property in the
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire including
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
single-family homes
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not trying uh one of the one
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
of the ways this bill is structured
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
right now is it's basically prohibits
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
any inspection of any uh single-family
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
home or multi-unit that's not the design
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
the design is only owner occupied units
 
00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I will put in a thing about
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
single-family homes but I'm going to try
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
to curtail it down to just for the
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
purposes of inspecting for the potential
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
of renting if the city wanted to inspect
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
my unit because I was going to rent it
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
totally fine with that that makes sense
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
right but the way housing is treated
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
four units or less are basically treated
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
the same as single-family homes so
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's this kind of loophole that I
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
believe the state should close down it
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
is very invasive when the government
 
00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
comes into your house without really
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
cause I told totally would understand if
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
I didn't agree to the inspection of my
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
owner occupied unit that I wouldn't be
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
able to rent it out until it was
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
inspected I'm fine with that but there
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
are people that I represent who have
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
lived in their owner occupied units for
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
30 years and every three years the
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
government has to come in and tell them
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
that they could rent it if they wanted
 
00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.630 align:start position:0%
that they could rent it if they wanted
to

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
so it's a gross invasion of privacy if
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
you live in a single family home this is
 
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
what I want you to imagine imagine if
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
every three years someone had to come
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
because the a inspector got to come into
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
your house and look through every closet
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
that you have go down in your basement
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
go up in your attic and inspect your
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
home on the potential that you could one
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
day rent it so that's the Gap that I'm
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
trying to close I unfortunately I was
 
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
trying to work on this over the weekend
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
but it turns out being a chairman of my
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and a business owner this
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
thing's runs out of the Wayside so if
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
the committee does itl because it's not
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
I will try to bring forth Amendment to
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
the committee at the committee itls it I
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
will bring it back next year I feel feel
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
that it is something that needs to be
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
addressed it is a gross invasion of
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
privacy to be told that because you live
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
in a multi-unit and you're a landlord
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
that they get to come in and look at
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
your inspection so with that I'm sure
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
why is it not a gross invasion of
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
privacy to inspect the tenants buildings
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
I I philosophically agree with you I
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if there will be the
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
political will to end inspections of
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
Apartments I'm not here to address that
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
today I philosophically I agree with you
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
that's not what I'm trying to do if that
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
was a separate thing I would probably
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
sign on to it just as a matter of
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
personal property rights but that's not
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
what I'm here today to try to do
 
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.170 align:start position:0%
what I'm here today to try to do
representative

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Berry for coming to
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
testify before us
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering if you uh have any
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
safety concerns yep uh so I knew that
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
point would be raised um my Counterpoint
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
to you would be that you could make that
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
argument about any piece of property I
 
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.910 align:start position:0%
argument about any piece of property I
agree

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so if that is the case I guess my my
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
counter question to you is why aren't we
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
inspecting every single residential
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
piece of property every three years good
 
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.690 align:start position:0%
piece of property every three years good
question

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
um this is somewhat building off of
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
Representative true 11's question but in
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
the choice to rent
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't you also bear the responsibility
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
of making sure they're safe
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
which requires you to make sure your
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
attached dwelling is also safe it
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
doesn't negatively impact them yeah so
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
once again you can make that argument
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
any single family home if you have a
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
single family home that's next to
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
another single family home and that
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
other single family home catches fire
 
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
the the flaves could jump over and grab
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
that other house my point is you can
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
make that argument about anything in any
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
piece of property in this you can make
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
that argument about sheds that have
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
electricity running to them that are on
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
a neighbor's fence line so you kind of
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
go into the slippery slope there at some
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
point you do have a right to personal
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
property my point is that a man's home
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
is his castle and if they live in four
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
units or less which are treated as
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
effectively single-family homes we need
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
to respect that I didn't put it in there
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
for five or more units because those are
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
treated differently right the government
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
has always treated those differently I
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
guess a Converse argument I would make
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
is if you have those safety concerns as
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
a tenant rent from a unit went from a
 
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:55.980 align:start position:0%
building that has five or more units
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
those are held to higher standards
 
00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.950 align:start position:0%
those are held to higher standards
already

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.349 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.710 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.549 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that um or did
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
you consider the the opening up the
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
option for the tenant
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
to not have their
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh unit uh inspected as a part of this
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
bill or making that
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
inspection you know at the request of
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
the tenant instead of just you know the
 
00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
government coming in and saying no
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
you're you're due
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
yeah it's actually something I did
 
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.430 align:start position:0%
yeah it's actually something I did
consider

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I I tried to scope the bill down um
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
because I know kind of if you try to
 
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
tackle too much at once then it gives
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
people a reason to to knock things down
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
I did actually consider that um because
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
that would kind of almost be the Best of
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
Both Worlds as a tenant of well I feel
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
like my landlord's a slumlord and
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
they're not up to municipal or state
 
00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.970 align:start position:0%
they're not up to municipal or state
codes

00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
um so I want this I want the municipal
 
00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:03.299 align:start position:0%
to come in um the Counterpoint to that
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
in my head having been a so I went from
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
being a tenant to a landlord I didn't do
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
the like you know living my own property
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
transition I I just flipped
 
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:13.980 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I could see as
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
a tenant would be you know it's
 
00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
effectively like am I ratting out my
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
landlord and is that going to create an
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
adversarial relationship
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I didn't think about that it's
 
00:59:23.089 --> 00:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
not in this bill just to be clear
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
um I did like have that kind of mental
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
exercise because it was worth having
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
um there's there's Plus or minuses right
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
the tenant should have a right to
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
privacy in my opinion
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
um you know in my in my leases it says
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
that I can enter the property with um I
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
have to give at least 24 hours note
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
notice unless there's an emergency
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty common cause I actually
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
had the very first people I run it to
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
were actually very good friends of mine
 
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
were like uh yo we don't want you coming
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
in with 24 hours notes we want three
 
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
days notice and I was like you know
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine as long as the pipe's not
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
bursting I don't really need to get in
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
there that quickly but yeah I think to
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
the some of the questions asked I think
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
tenants have a right to privacy as well
 
00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
um you know as a landlord I have a right
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that my property is not
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
being abused so like there's a balancing
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
act there
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
um but I you know for the same reason I
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
would I feel violated when the
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
government comes into my house to tell
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
me that I could rent it if I wanted to
 
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
uh I could totally see a tenant having
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
the same objection of being like yeah I
 
01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
think my place is fine and I don't want
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
the government coming in but that's once
 
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
again that's not in this bill it's
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
definitely a philosophical conversation
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
I would have at tandy's though
 
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:27.730 align:start position:0%
I would have at tandy's though
foreign

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:27.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.490 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
so

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
um as a tenant who has
 
01:00:42.049 --> 01:00:42.059 align:start position:0%
uh yearly inspections um so
 
01:00:42.059 --> 01:00:43.549 align:start position:0%
uh yearly inspections um so
um

01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.319 --> 01:00:48.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
my my
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
experience is generally with with the
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
inspections is generally that the
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance guy just comes by and asks
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
me if anything's wrong and leaves really
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and um doesn't yes there's a
 
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.829 align:start position:0%
quickly and um doesn't yes there's a
question

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and and doesn't violate
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
um my privacy at all so do you
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be possible to say
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
just say
 
01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:19.250 align:start position:0%
just say
that

01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.450 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
inspections should be in a way done in a
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
way that doesn't violate privacy rather
 
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.930 align:start position:0%
way that doesn't violate privacy rather
than

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
um rather than just outlawing them
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
entirely yeah so I think I think um the
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative maybe you may be a little
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
off base on what that sounds like an
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
inspection from your landlord's
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance inspector
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
um that's a landlord tenant issue this
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
is the city of Manchester sending a
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
government inspector into my home
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
um without honestly my consent once
 
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
again director Knight was wonderful was
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
very nice he was doing his job I'm not
 
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
after him
 
01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
um it's just the the statement of well
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
you could rent it is a problem
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
um I lived before I moved into my place
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
I lived in a a apartment building I
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
think it had like 32 units or something
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
they came by once a year to inspect it
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh just as them but then I was there for
 
01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
their COC inspection and it is more
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
thorough they go into the basement they
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
go into the attic you know they're
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
looking at wiring there's no you know
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
it's not you know knock on the door hey
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
is anything good here and then you know
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's not like that they are they
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
are in your stuff
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in your testimony
 
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
you've referenced COC several times
 
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
could you define that
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
um and and part of my question after we
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
understand what that is when a a home or
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
a building in which people will inhabit
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
when it's newly constructed there's a
 
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupancy granted in
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
order for people to inhabit that
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
building how does that initial
 
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
certificate of occupants occupancy
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
differ from these
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
every three-year inspections so the COC
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
is our certificate of compliances
 
01:03:14.089 --> 01:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
they're different from the certificate
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
of occupancies the certificate of
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
compliances these are these are not
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
annual but in new Manchester and it
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
differs by City Nashua has them as well
 
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
I would be stunned if conquer didn't
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
have them
 
01:03:26.809 --> 01:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
um but they are they are inspections to
 
01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
make sure that your property is livable
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
that are routine right so imagine if for
 
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
your certificate of occupancy right
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
imagine if every three years I don't
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
know what town you're from but a match
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
of every three years the town came
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
through to renew your Civic kit of
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
options occupancy in your house that's
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
effectively what they're doing to owner
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for uh
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative for answering my question
 
01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.329 align:start position:0%
representative for answering my question
um

01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:02.780 align:start position:0%
would you have the same expectation of
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
requiring a building permit if you are
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
renovating your whole kitchen with new
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
appliances and new power needs and
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
um no um and I actually spoke with uh
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
somebody I forget was somebody from
 
01:04:17.809 --> 01:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
Nashua and he raised this point and that
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
was actually why the bill does need a
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
mending this is not aimed at like
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
permitted new construction or anything
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
like that because at that point right
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're not like they've issued a permit
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
right we're showing up to make sure the
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
work was done by code right we're in a
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
different process right there's a level
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
of consent what we're talking about here
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
is every three years with no changes
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
right no perceived changes to the
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
property every three years the
 
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
government's coming in and looking at it
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:49.789 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.470 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
um

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
that there is no reporting mechanisms in
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester for once
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
for owner occupancy to change and to
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
become rental
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
you are not required to contact the city
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
and said I've been here a year and I'm
 
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.220 align:start position:0%
going to move elsewhere I'm going to
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
rent this they have no way of knowing
 
01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:17.450 align:start position:0%
rent this they have no way of knowing
that

01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
is this correct
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
um yes but to the point of your question
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
if the COC process changed right in
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester so let's say this bill
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
becomes law right
 
01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
um and they can't inspect owner-occupied
 
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
units right but let's say as a landlord
 
01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
I plan on moving out in the next year
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
and my coc's up I might say hey come and
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
inspect this so I can rent it right but
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
it's you know you don't make that
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
requirement of any single family home
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
right a person who owns a single family
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
home could move out and start renting
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
their property and by the way underneath
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester's ordinance they
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
have to get a COC but there's no
 
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
notification requirement so that's a
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
problem for the city of Manchester
 
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
um but you have to understand that owner
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
occupied units are legally treated the
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
same as single-family homes for four
 
01:06:02.569 --> 01:06:02.579 align:start position:0%
units or less right once they hit that
 
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
five five units there's too many people
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
living there there's a more compelling
 
01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
State interest to to look at more
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
regularly but when you're talking about
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
four units or less we're not talking
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
about you know Mega you know Mega
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
property development companies we're
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
talking about these people like me right
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
you usually middle class people who are
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to mitigate their
 
01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.990 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to mitigate their
mortgage

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
mortgage
 
01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's my message to the committee is
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
you can make that argument every
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
argument you make you can make about a
 
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:30.740 align:start position:0%
single family home and that's the danger
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
what stops my Counterpoint to you is
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
what would stop the city of Manchester
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
from saying you could rent any single
 
01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:38.339 align:start position:0%
family home in the city of Manchester
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
every three years we're inspecting every
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
house because you could move out of it
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
and you could rent it
 
01:06:46.329 --> 01:06:46.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah right but it is true that
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
if you make if you're a single family
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
owner in Manchester you have to notify
 
01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
the building department if you make any
 
01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.270 align:start position:0%
the building department if you make any
substance

01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
substance
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
alterations to your building and they
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
have to inspect it correct you can't
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
just do you know that's my question yeah
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
correct but once again you can make that
 
01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:09.059 align:start position:0%
argument about any single family home
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm not talking about people who
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
make permitted changes right if I want
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
to go and somehow turn my duplex into a
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
Triplex which I don't even know how I
 
01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
would do um but if I do that I have to
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
go to the city I have to get a permit
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
right I'm now doing things that are kind
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
of outside the scope of you know me
 
01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
living in my home undisturbed
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:33.059 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative could
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
you turn your mic off there represent a
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
priest seeing no more questions I have
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
one question for you and that would be
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a potential
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment what would that Amendment
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
briefly include yep um so right now uh
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
the bill was closely to what I needed to
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
do um but right now it could be
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted um to the point about
 
01:07:54.049 --> 01:07:54.059 align:start position:0%
alterations uh permanent alterations it
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted that you can make
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
permanent alterations and not have them
 
01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299 align:start position:0%
inspected so that needs to be tightened
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
up I need to make sure it's also in the
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
right section of RSA obviously I'm an
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
election law guy so this is this is a a
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
I have a lot to catch up with on this in
 
01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
this section uh so that's what I'm
 
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
looking for and I do appreciate the
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
committee's indulgment on addressing
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to address and not the
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
some semi-flawed language in this bill
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I will fill out
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
my pink card thank you very much
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Barry seeing no more
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
questions I see no
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
more pink cards we will close the
 
01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
hearing on this one after I announce
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
that on the blue sign up sheet there was
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
one individual signing up in favor and
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
with that we close the hearing on 477
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
wow believe it or not we are actually 15
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
minutes before our next
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think that's a first
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
so at 11 30 we will do our next hearing
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:12.129 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back everybody uh uh we are

01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 526
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
now the problem is that we have
 
01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
qualified flaggers
 
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
that are being replaced by police
 
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
officers unnecessarily
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
at a much higher cost to the public
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
now this isn't a new issue that's come
 
01:29:02.639 --> 01:29:04.790 align:start position:0%
now this isn't a new issue that's come
up

01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
up
um

01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
part of the problem I think is because
 
01:29:13.010 --> 01:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
some communities have created revolving
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
accounts and they can get money into the
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
revolving accounts if the police
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
officers work detail and they'll tell
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
the public well we can buy you a cruise
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
of this way or whatnot
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
um but still that's really no excuse to
 
01:29:27.649 --> 01:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
be pushing people out of the way
 
01:29:30.169 --> 01:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
and taking over their job these are
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
qualified flaggers it's no different
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
than having police come in and say to
 
01:29:36.410 --> 01:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
the Walmart greeter and say you need to
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
step aside we're going to do your job at
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
I uh Came Upon
 
01:29:48.490 --> 01:29:48.500 align:start position:0%
some of Jeb Bradley and Neil Kirk's work
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
then look into the issue and they came
 
01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
forward with a study committee which is
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
what I brought before you
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee they did excuse me that was in
 
01:30:07.790 --> 01:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
2015 and they did do a a bill after that
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
it went it's not in the Senate
 
01:30:13.010 --> 01:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but they ended up tabling it then
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
and uh and so anyway I've gone back to
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
that I talked to his office and I was
 
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
able to dig up the final report and it
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
was interesting
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
and you all have that before you and
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
I've highlighted the section that's what
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
I think is pertinent anyway
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
and as you as you can see down at the
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
meeting summaries
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley explained that this
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
topic had been brought forward to the
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislature on behalf of the Public
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
Utility Commission
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of using a flagger for the
 
01:30:48.110 --> 01:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
utility company is approximately 25 per
 
01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:50.219 align:start position:0%
hour while the cost of a police detail
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
is approximately 75 dollars per hour the
 
01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
objective of the bill
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
is to reduce costs for utilities so that
 
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
they may pass on rate savings to
 
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.870 align:start position:0%
they may pass on rate savings to
customers

01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
so they had this little study committee
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
together and uh I don't know if any of
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
you remember Cordell Johnson
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it was actually John's ton
 
01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
of the municipal
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
Association you see on page two I've
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted that he came forward with a
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
compromise language
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
and that's down at the bottom at the
 
01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation I highlighted the
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
language and limit the use of police to
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
only one specific safety concerns occur
 
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
or if qualified flaggers are not
 
01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
or if qualified flaggers are not
available

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what you see in the bill so I
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
brought that language forward from the
 
01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
2015 study and I still think the issue
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
is more pertinent today than ever before
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
because the public sees this
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
and they see it as a form of corruption
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
despite the mafia coming in and telling
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
you you're going to step aside and if
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
the police are needed the bill allows
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
for that exception
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
but the public knows that qualify flag
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
is to be pushed aside unnecessarily
 
01:32:10.610 --> 01:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
and this isn't a good time to be
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh continue with that image
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
now I had a number of people said they
 
01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
plan on coming
 
01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:20.219 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire uh consumer Advocate
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
Don creese is the one that actually
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
encouraged me to file this bill he said
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
he would be over at the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
um executive councils today and he tried
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
to get over here but otherwise he would
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
send in some written testimony people
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire Electric Co-op asked
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
me to do this uh bill
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
so but as you can see behind me this is
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
why people are afraid to speak out
 
01:32:49.850 --> 01:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm the exception but there's a
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
force behind me
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to tell you not to do this
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear about probably sex
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
offenders and things like that that are
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
involved with
 
01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
involved with
flaggers

01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
flaggers
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
um that's that's what came up in the
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
last testimony during this study
 
01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.169 align:start position:0%
last testimony during this study
um

01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
of course it's really about money is
 
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
what it's all about
 
01:33:17.090 --> 01:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
um so I think I've let me check my notes
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
I think I've touched on
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
most of the bases
 
01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:25.490 align:start position:0%
most of the bases
um

01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I just feel this is like
 
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
being in a third world country to see
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing going on we should be
 
01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.390 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing going on we should be
ashamed

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
ashamed
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
to see this and this is our opportunity
 
01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:35.689 align:start position:0%
to see this and this is our opportunity
to

01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
correct it
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
Bickford uh before I open it up for
 
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
questions I just want to be clear on the
 
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:46.380 align:start position:0%
this that you handed out that was from
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh 2015. correct okay it's on it it's on
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
it says I saw that it said laws of 2015
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm just clarifying for myself to
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that this went down in 2015
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
which it appears it does but I'm just
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying for myself
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I think that's our only
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
indication right there okay and I assume
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
it may have happened it may have
 
01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
happened in 16 you know where they they
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
created this
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
understudy I just for reference it
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
wasn't 2006 2020 it was around 2015.
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
yeah that's up that would be correct
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay and I assume you're open to
 
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
questions certainly representative power
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question pertains
 
01:34:31.689 --> 01:34:31.699 align:start position:0%
to the language on line five of the bill
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
where it states specific safety concerns
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
about the project could you define what
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
the criteria or explain what the
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
criteria is with regard to specific
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
safety concerns relative to a project
 
01:34:53.209 --> 01:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
and perhaps give some examples I cannot
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
I really think it's a little bit vague
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh and I'm worried about whether it
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
would be continually abused with that
 
01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
kind of language in there but I think
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I can't answer that very
 
01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.910 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I can't answer that very
accurately

01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative priests
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so we all know that
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
the local police officers have training
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
in this in traffic control and safety
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of training will these
 
01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
temporary people have
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
to do this work
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
they are all they are qualified flaggers
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
I was I was hoping some would said that
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
they would be here that does that sort
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
what what kind of training and where
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
does this training come from
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:35:59.699 --> 01:36:00.350 align:start position:0%
I don't know
um

01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
but when I talked to the New Hampshire
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
Cooperative they said that they they had
 
01:36:06.169 --> 01:36:06.179 align:start position:0%
to be trained they cannot use anything
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
but trained people for their projects
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just looking
 
01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.590 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just looking
um

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
the uh front cover of the bill
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
um it has the committee listed as Eda on
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
here I'm wondering if this is this like
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
a second committee for the bill or um
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
did it get misassigned or could you tell
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
us what happened with there at all I
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
think that was an ERA
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
and then they realized it was more
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate to come to this committee
 
01:36:42.110 --> 01:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
which I agree
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
I I didn't have anything to do with
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
actually I didn't even know this Bill
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
had come out
 
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
until I found it on the New Hampshire
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal association website for
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
clarification for the committee this
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
bill was vacated to our committee from
 
01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.649 align:start position:0%
bill was vacated to our committee from
the

01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
EDM executive departments and
 
01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
administrative committee that's why
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's on the front of the bill I should
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
have mentioned that at the beginning
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's the only Bill within our
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
committee by the way that has been
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
vacated to us so I I don't know what
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
happened my neighbor my name never even
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
showed up in the calendar for the two
 
01:37:17.689 --> 01:37:17.699 align:start position:0%
bills I filed
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
so I never had a chance to do any
 
01:37:23.689 --> 01:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh amending or change it before it get
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
came to here but I think it's a good
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
language to start with
 
01:37:30.169 --> 01:37:30.179 align:start position:0%
representative Keller
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:32.930 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:34.669 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:39.620 align:start position:0%
who decides is it the person
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
hiring the flagger or the town that
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
decides who what the specific safety
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.250 --> 01:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
um in this case there is it would still
 
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%

House Bill 526 over the next few minutes
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
I will give you examples of why we
 
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:22.139 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly oppose this bill as it
 
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
relates to when a local law enforcement
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
officer shall be used during
 
01:39:26.159 --> 01:39:26.750 align:start position:0%

projects that require traffic control
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel I will also provide a sample
 
01:39:32.750 --> 01:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
statistic which was collected from
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
electric gas sewer and tree Crews
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
working in the city of Manchester on
 
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
February the 7th
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
if I could draw your attention to
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
January 19th of this year officer Daniel
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
Craig was working in construction detail
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
for liver utilities on Laurel Street in
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester officer Craig had
 
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
been on his detail post since
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
approximately 7 A.M
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
when at about 5 pm he noticed a flagger
 
01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
who was working the other end of the
 
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
construction zone running towards him
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
officer Craig was advised that a vehicle
 
01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
had gone around the flagger struck the
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
flagger's vehicle and was heading
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
towards the Liberty Utilities crew which
 
01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
was working on the roadway officer Craig
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
was able to get the driver to stop and
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
put the vehicle in park while speaking
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
with the operator officer Craig observed
 
01:40:16.370 --> 01:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
signs of impairment and based upon his
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
roadside investigation officer Craig
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
placed the female operator under arrest
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
for operating under the influence of
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
liquor second offense in disobeying a
 
01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:27.659 align:start position:0%
police officer
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
this was a case where a flagger clearly
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
had no visible presence in the roadway
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
no authority to be able to stop the
 
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:34.370 align:start position:0%
no authority to be able to stop the
vehicle

01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
and officer Craig's quick actions
 
01:40:38.209 --> 01:40:38.219 align:start position:0%
subsequently stopped a two-time offender
 
01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
from seriously hurting or maybe worse
 
01:40:43.490 --> 01:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
killing a gas construction crew
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is just one example of how officers
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
take enforcement on uh on details
 
01:40:49.370 --> 01:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I could go on for quite a
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
long time giving examples of vehicles
 
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
going around flaggers while in
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
construction zones but I won't waste
 
01:40:55.370 --> 01:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
your time
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
in doing research for this bill I was
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
told this would help small tree trimming
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
outfits on the back roads of New
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire save money
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
well I was able to speak with the owners
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
of two small family tree companies both
 
01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
who work in the Manchester and the
 
01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%
greater area
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
the owners of both companies stated that
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
they would rather hire police officers
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
any day of the week
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
in that their financial savings is
 
01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:15.950 align:start position:0%
in that their financial savings is
minimal

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
next I spoke with gas electric cable
 
01:41:20.689 --> 01:41:20.699 align:start position:0%
sewer and Sewer Crews that were working
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
in the city on February 7th
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
six electric Crews one cable crew two
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
tree trimming Crews two gas Crews and a
 
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
SuperCrew out of the 12 Crews 11 stated
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
they wanted flaggers sorry 11 stated
 
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
they wanted police officers over
 
01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
flaggers at every job site the 12th
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
through did not care who was hired nine
 
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
of the 12 Crews stated that they have
 
01:41:43.209 --> 01:41:43.219 align:start position:0%
witnessed a police officer working
 
01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
working their detail taking enforcement
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
action while in the work Zone
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
they stated this ability for enforcement
 
01:41:53.149 --> 01:41:53.159 align:start position:0%
often makes the work Zone safer
 
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
one tree crew stated a police officer
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
was not available he would rather put
 
01:41:58.250 --> 01:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
his own employees in the roadway for
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
traffic control before hiring flaggers
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
this small sample size shows that more
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
than 91 percent of the time crews in the
 
01:42:06.649 --> 01:42:06.659 align:start position:0%
roadway prefer police officers
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
conducting traffic control over flaggers
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
as a police officer we go through
 
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
stinging back stringent background
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
checks thousands of hours of training
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
and carry tools and ensure Public Safety
 
01:42:18.530 --> 01:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester there are
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
eight registered sex offenders who list
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
a flagging company as their place of
 
01:42:22.199 --> 01:42:23.149 align:start position:0%
a flagging company as their place of
employment

01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
this is troublesome as Crews often move
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
around to different work areas not
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
knowing who their Flagger of the day is
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
it is very possible that a registered
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
sex offender could be working in your
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
neighborhood or even worse a school zone
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
in your town
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
yesterday I had the privilege of
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
speaking with the owner of a local
 
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:41.940 align:start position:0%
flagging company this individual agreed
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not make sense and
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
has potential negative impacts on both
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
sides this owner agree with me that if
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's not broke why fix it
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
the police officer versus Flagger
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
problem was addressed in 2018 and has
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
worked for both sides since then
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
finally I know most of you are fully
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
aware of the hiring and retention
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
challenges that state and just what
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
every city and town are facing in the
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
area of law enforcement passing this
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
bill will only add to that problem
 
01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:11.100 align:start position:0%
recruitment of new police officers is at
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
a crisis Point everywhere the New
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police are currently
 
01:43:16.609 --> 01:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
have around 70 open positions
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is serious taking away one of the
 
01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
areas of work that many police officers
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
depend on will make recruitment
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
retention even more challenging
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
those of us in law enforcement love the
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
work we do
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
safety is our job and that's why I want
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
to urge you to defeat House Bill 526
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony going to
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
remind everybody try to keep it to three
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
minutes we were a little generous with
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
you on that one but if anybody in the
 
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
future please keep it to three minutes
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
 
01:43:47.639 --> 01:43:49.669 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
mandaputi

01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
mandaputi
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you officer for
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:55.609 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:59.209 --> 01:43:59.219 align:start position:0%
there are two parts to it one is having
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
the police officer as a flag for any
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
construction area but that isn't that uh
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
currently a local Municipal ordinance
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
where you know if it's a small job they
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
don't need to have but if it is cost
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
effective to have in a major job isn't
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
current existing one where it gives the
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
people who are doing the construction
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
to either use officer or a flagger I
 
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
guess it comes down to local control of
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
the the town of the city
 
01:44:37.189 --> 01:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.010 --> 01:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and and thank
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned a little bit about the
 
01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.290 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned a little bit about the
uh

01:44:47.290 --> 01:44:47.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
difficulties in retention with respect
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
to Police Department are you aware of
 
01:44:58.490 --> 01:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities within New Hampshire that
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
are offering sign-on bonuses to get
 
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
police officers
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
I am
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
as a selectman in my town is there a
 
01:45:10.490 --> 01:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes yes there is I'm sorry
 
01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up apologize just a follow-up
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
as a selectman I can I can tell you that
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
it is the the police departments are in
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
uh significant pressure all along the
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
line and
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
would would it be your testimony that
 
01:45:34.490 --> 01:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
passing this would be another
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
knife in the back of police departments
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh taking this away from
 
01:45:41.639 --> 01:45:43.010 align:start position:0%
with respect to uh taking this away from
them

01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I would say yes
 
01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I would say yes
um

01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
you know I can't speak for everyone I
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
see other jurisdictions but the overtime
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
budgets for some agencies are greater or
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
smaller for others and this is just a
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
extra layer of financial means that
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
people can make and I use the boots on
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
the ground having a detail there is a
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
police officer for us in the city today
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have 22 details that are working so
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
God forbid something major ever happened
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
that's 22 extra police officers that
 
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
have a radio in their hand that could
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
immediately respond to something if that
 
01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.390 align:start position:0%
immediately respond to something if that
occurred

01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:16.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:18.590 --> 01:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Davis
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:46:23.209 --> 01:46:23.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question we on the municipal
 
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
and County government committee tend to
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
be a little geeky about these things so
 
01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
bear with me this is my first time bear
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
with me as well please the
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
the horse
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:38.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:46:38.209 --> 01:46:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
bringing forward legislation that would
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
give afari to authority to the municipal
 
01:46:45.770 --> 01:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
governing body to adopt ordinances
 
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
regarding the use of flaggers
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
the law before us
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
would you say that that this law before
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
us does that or would you say that this
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
Law requires
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
that said municipalities do this because
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
a very big difference between enabling
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that's recommended in the
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
report and what's being suggested here I
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
get my question you're asking if this
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
Law requires
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
um companies to hire flaggers prior to
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
hiring police officers I'm asking if
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
this law requires municipalities to
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm going to ask the
 
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
same question that I asked the prime and
 
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.669 align:start position:0%
same question that I asked the prime and
that's

01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:47:40.679 --> 01:47:45.550 align:start position:0%
that's
um regarding

01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
characterizing specific safety concerns
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
about a project and um what does that
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
look like and could you give some
 
01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:56.030 align:start position:0%
look like and could you give some
examples

01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:57.129 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:47:57.129 --> 01:47:57.139 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me I think you're going to hear
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
testimony after me uh safety concerns in
 
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
the city
 
01:48:04.129 --> 01:48:04.139 align:start position:0%
um you know we as a city we there's
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
holes in the ground that would be a
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
safety concern that um we would have to
 
01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:08.510 align:start position:0%
safety concern that um we would have to
prevent

01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:09.590 align:start position:0%
prevent
um

01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
traffic from flowing down a certain
 
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.050 align:start position:0%
traffic from flowing down a certain
Street

01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
Street
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
um we hire many details in the city for
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
um marathons that require closing down
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
of intersections that it's my
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
understanding that flaggers cannot
 
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.149 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
question

01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
could it be characterized that
 
01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:35.930 align:start position:0%
could it be characterized that
every

01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
incident where you would need a flag or
 
01:48:40.010 --> 01:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
would be a potential safety concern
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:49.609 --> 01:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
um what is your understanding of the
 
01:48:53.450 --> 01:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
current state of affairs of who decides
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether a flagger is allowed or not or
 
01:48:59.450 --> 01:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
if a officer is required to so it comes
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
down each town or city as my
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
understanding thank you
 
01:49:05.930 --> 01:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tatro you still have a
 
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.770 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
um

01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:19.129 --> 01:49:19.139 align:start position:0%
sometimes my years pick up things that
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
just stick there
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and one was the statement that you made
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
response of the
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
way I understood it and correct me if
 
01:49:33.850 --> 01:49:33.860 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong
 
01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:39.169 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
if they had an emergency in the area
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
you would move those offices
 
01:49:47.450 --> 01:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
to go to that
 
01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:48.890 align:start position:0%
to go to that
incident

01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
incident
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
what um what happens to the traffic
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
control for the construction company or
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
do they shut down
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
to my understand that they would be they
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
could be shut down depending on you know
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
what the incident may be or where they
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
so what you're telling us is that
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
assigned to that
 
01:50:16.199 --> 01:50:19.129 align:start position:0%
assigned to that
detail

01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:50:21.410 --> 01:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
are required someplace else
 
01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:22.970 align:start position:0%
are required someplace else
then

01:50:22.970 --> 01:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
they're without flaggers I think that's
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
a I use that example but that's an
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
extreme measure that if a mass casualty
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
or mass event may happen that is just
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
for the boots on the ground most of the
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
times you're going to have your boots on
 
01:50:34.570 --> 01:50:34.580 align:start position:0%
the ground of the community
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
on you know city streets and they're
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
there most jobs are we work in the city
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
are lengthy projects and you know same
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
officers take those jobs
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
you know every other week or every week
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so they get to know
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:50:56.570 --> 01:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
taking a second question so um with
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
regards to utilizing local law
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement for temporary traffic
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
control is that typically a a police
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
officer would be utilized that's on
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
schedule that day or would it be
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that was maybe not scheduled to
 
01:51:19.490 --> 01:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
come in and work on that day but would
 
01:51:21.530 --> 01:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
would come in to do that do you
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
understand the question yeah so I think
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
you're saying it would they be on shift
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
or required or would they be off shift
 
01:51:28.729 --> 01:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
this is uh most details that members
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
work are uh off duty they're after hours
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
or they're on their days off I work
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday so if I'm taking a
 
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
detail it has to be after hours or on
 
01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:38.699 align:start position:0%
the weekends
 
01:51:38.699 --> 01:51:39.890 align:start position:0%
the weekends
so

01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
therefore with that police officer they
 
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
would be they would be paid overtime is
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
that correct for that Duty we at the in
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
the city have a detail rate it's a
 
01:51:58.330 --> 01:51:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know cases in
 
01:52:08.209 --> 01:52:08.219 align:start position:0%
the state where they haven't used police
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
officers they just used
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
people they've
 
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
you know just temporary flaggers
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
and have there been any catastrophes
 
01:52:22.609 --> 01:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
in the city that we have some details
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
that use flaggers during the day if a
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
police officer is not available to take
 
01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:28.729 align:start position:0%
police officer is not available to take
it

01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:52:28.739 --> 01:52:29.750 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
again there's you know instances all the
 
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
time that you know the people in the
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
public drive around uh flaggers they
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
they don't you know it's a safety
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
concern because they can't take any
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement action
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
um if they were to drive around me when
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
I'm on a detail I can legally stop them
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
pull them over like it would be a car
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
stop issue them a summons if need be or
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
just correct the driving behavior
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
um flaggers aren't able to do that
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Albert
 
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill
 
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
do you think that having the police
 
01:53:02.689 --> 01:53:02.699 align:start position:0%
vehicles with their lights increases
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
safety along this absolutely one of the
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
tree companies specifically said a
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
cruiser on the back road is a lot safer
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
than having a flagger
 
01:53:14.090 --> 01:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
okay see
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you
 
01:53:20.510 --> 01:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
since these officers are off duty is the
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
use of police
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
um assets like the the cruiser allowed
 
01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:29.030 align:start position:0%
um assets like the the cruiser allowed
during

01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
um this these FL flagging opportunities
 
01:53:36.410 --> 01:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
or for these officers that's up to the
 
01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:37.550 align:start position:0%
or for these officers that's up to the
um

01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
don't quote me based on where they work
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the city or what is going on that day
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
they can request the cruiser as an
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
additional payment or additional money
 
01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
they can request it for us in the city
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
so you get a police officer detail and
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
then you can if you need a cruiser our
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
crews are specified depending on the
 
01:53:55.010 --> 01:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
roadway that's when a cruiser can be
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
brought in
 
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony we'll call Mike
 
01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:01.669 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony we'll call Mike
uh

01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
I was going to say good morning but
 
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
we're almost at noon right now so I will
 
01:54:18.890 --> 01:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
still say good morning
 
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark bodoin and I'm opposed
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
to this legislation
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired detective sergeant from
 
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State Police I retired
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
in 2019. I'm currently a member of the
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Troopers Association in
 
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Police Association and
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
both entities are opposed to this bill
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be very brief because I
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
believe my colleague officer Daley spoke
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
about most of the concerns we have
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know obviously one of the concerns
 
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
we have is this takes away some local
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
control from the municipalities as State
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
Police doesn't affect us as much we're
 
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
usually out on the highways and some of
 
01:55:02.689 --> 01:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
the larger roadways but there are times
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
where you know if they can't fill a
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
detail at a local town they sometimes
 
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:09.179 align:start position:0%
will either call the sheriff's
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
department or the state police to see if
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
one of us could fill in that role so
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
look this does take away some local
 
01:55:15.719 --> 01:55:16.609 align:start position:0%
look this does take away some local
control

01:55:16.609 --> 01:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:55:19.129 --> 01:55:19.139 align:start position:0%
two uh I think Public Safety is
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
important uh I can tell you there's been
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions where Troopers have
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
been working details uh and have
 
01:55:27.770 --> 01:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
received uh they call them bolos be on
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
the lookout for and it could be anything
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
from an armed robbery a theft even up to
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
a homicide
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
um any number of things DWIs erratic
 
01:55:39.649 --> 01:55:39.659 align:start position:0%
operations whatever it might be
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of times these uh Troopers that
 
01:55:44.209 --> 01:55:44.219 align:start position:0%
are on these details can take that
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement or action or look out for
 
01:55:47.689 --> 01:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
that vehicle while they're there during
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
the traffic uh uh assignment uh I think
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative you asked you know does
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
that take away from the crew that's on
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
the side of the road I would say that
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
most of the occasions the enforcement
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
action is taken right there at the scene
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
so they're still there with the crew uh
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
what would happen is another a trooper
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
would call an on-duty Trooper to come
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
and then handle the rest of the
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
situation at that point but they would
 
01:56:12.109 --> 01:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
be the ones that could make that
 
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
immediate uh detention
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
so Public Safety this this does affect
 
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
Public Safety
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
and lastly you've heard a lot about
 
01:56:22.850 --> 01:56:22.860 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention I can tell you
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a recruitment and retention
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
specifically State Police is down 70
 
01:56:29.450 --> 01:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
Troopers which is about 20 percent of
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
our state police force uh that we're
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
trying to struggle to recruit and retain
 
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:36.900 align:start position:0%
the ones that we have
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
I can tell you uh from my career when I
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
first started as a young police officer
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
young trooper I did a lot of these
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
construction details I worked with a lot
 
01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:48.659 align:start position:0%
of these construction companies as I got
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
older and as I progressed through the uh
 
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
the uh the years on the job uh
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
financially I no longer needed it so I
 
01:56:58.250 --> 01:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
didn't do it as much but I can tell you
 
01:57:00.590 --> 01:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
that for young police officers that are
 
01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
starting young families uh this is you
 
01:57:05.689 --> 01:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
know extra Financial money that assists
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
them in getting off the ground uh I can
 
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
tell you my wife and I struggled when I
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
was a young police officer and so this
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
would only hurt that Recruitment and
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
Retention make it worse I wanted to keep
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
it very brief but with that I'm willing
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
to take any questions that you may have
 
01:57:24.290 --> 01:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to speak
 
01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.490 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to speak
today

01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
three minutes and eight seconds very
 
01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.870 align:start position:0%
three minutes and eight seconds very
good

01:57:31.870 --> 01:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
um so about the recruitment and
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
um retention
 
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.410 align:start position:0%
um retention
part

01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:44.990 align:start position:0%
part
um

01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't this also
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
possibly reduce the number of
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
slots that need to be recruited for in
 
01:57:58.970 --> 01:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:00.890 --> 01:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure I understand the
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
question but I'm assuming the question
 
01:58:04.609 --> 01:58:04.619 align:start position:0%
has to do with our you mean taking away
 
01:58:06.530 --> 01:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
from these available officers to be out
 
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
there on the street already is that what
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
you're asking about
 
01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:11.450 align:start position:0%
you're asking about
or

01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:14.050 align:start position:0%
or
um

01:58:14.050 --> 01:58:14.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:20.689 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:58:20.689 --> 01:58:20.699 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.229 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
um do you have
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
um concerns that
 
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.310 align:start position:0%
um concerns that
um

01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:35.089 --> 01:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
uh about overwork of our police officers
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
um and that they're that they need some
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
decompression time to be able to uh
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
effectively you know do their job when
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
they are on duty and how
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
um and if these types of opportunities
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
may put them in that continued stressful
 
01:58:57.290 --> 01:58:57.300 align:start position:0%
environment where they don't have that
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
time to decompress sure so
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
um police officers obviously have a
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
schedule some people have Monday through
 
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:07.380 align:start position:0%
Friday schedules like I had towards the
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
end of my career when I worked in major
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
crime most Patrol uh Troopers or Patrol
 
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
officers use a rotating schedule so they
 
01:59:16.850 --> 01:59:16.860 align:start position:0%
have different days off during the week
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
and that's usually when they will pick
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
up these details or on the days off or
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
after hours so to speak I know State
 
01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
Police and I'm pretty sure a lot of the
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
Departments too have a policy that
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
speaks specifically to working extra
 
01:59:34.010 --> 01:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
construction or extra Duty details and
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
State Police specifically limits the
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
amount of hours that you can work
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
those for that specific reason because
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
they want their law enforcement to have
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative L
 
01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:51.589 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative L
Word

01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
Word
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:59:57.169 --> 01:59:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
does the municipality or the city
 
02:00:04.089 --> 02:00:04.099 align:start position:0%
contract directly with the officer
 
02:00:07.330 --> 02:00:07.340 align:start position:0%
contract with the officer individually
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
no so what occurs is they contract with
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
the the department uh whatever
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
Department that's going to hire them so
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
for example if you had a small town and
 
02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
none of their officers were available to
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
do this they would contact the company
 
02:00:23.209 --> 02:00:23.219 align:start position:0%
itself would contact either the
 
02:00:25.070 --> 02:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department or the Troopers uh
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
you know the state police and would say
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
I need one police officer for this job
 
02:00:31.689 --> 02:00:31.699 align:start position:0%
at this location
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
that agency would then take that
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
information send it out to their
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
available offices and say hey anybody
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
interested in work in this detail
 
02:00:40.970 --> 02:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
somebody would raise their hand say yes
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
I do what would happen is that agency
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
would Bill the contractor the contractor
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
would pay the bill and then that the
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
agency basically pays up front the
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
officer that goes there so they're
 
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
recouping the cost on the back end from
 
02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:07.139 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I I'm also a
 
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
selectman in my town and is it it's my
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh this issue is
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
usually coming under a Union contract
 
02:01:20.629 --> 02:01:20.639 align:start position:0%
and do you know of any other communities
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the state that have this issue
 
02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.629 align:start position:0%
in the state that have this issue
covered

02:01:25.629 --> 02:01:25.639 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:01:28.490 --> 02:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
in my when I say the issue I mean who
 
02:01:32.930 --> 02:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
goes first you know I have a list uh and
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh what how much we charge how much
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
money comes back to the town and it's a
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
discretionary fund that's used for the
 
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
police officers to buy bullets and that
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
kind of thing is that did you have any
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
issue like that I can't speak to what
 
02:01:52.490 --> 02:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
every agency does uh I can speak to my
 
02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what state police does so
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
there is some language in our uh collect
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
a bargaining agreement that speaks to
 
02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
details and specifically there is rules
 
02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
as to uh who can be next on the list
 
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
when a detail comes forward so with the
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
state police they go by who has the
 
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
fewest number of hours and they fill
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
those people first before they go to the
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
people that have more hours on record
 
02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.589 align:start position:0%
people that have more hours on record
already

02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
they do build a company a certain flat
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
fee and that Fleet flat fee incorporates
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
the police officers uh pay uh portion of
 
02:02:31.129 --> 02:02:31.139 align:start position:0%
the benefits and with State Police you
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
get a cruiser so there's a there's a
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit higher sometimes in a
 
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
local agency because you're also paying
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
for the cruiser so now
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times the agency does
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes have a few extra dollars left
 
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:46.860 align:start position:0%
over here and there but it's usually not
 
02:02:49.729 --> 02:02:49.739 align:start position:0%
a cash cow so to speak
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes if that builds up a
 
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
little bit they may use it to build to
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
um uh buy some funds that sometimes
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
relate to this like for example I
 
02:02:59.930 --> 02:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
remember State Police one time I took
 
02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
the excess funds that they had in this
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
account and they bought new high
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
visibility uh rain jackets for the
 
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
Troopers to use on these details
 
02:03:12.169 --> 02:03:12.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairman follow-up yeah I I
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
know that your
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
knowledge is on a state level well I was
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
more than interested in local levelists
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
but did you do you know that in many
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
cases if not all cases when there is a
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
Union contract between the local
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
community that this issue is in that
 
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
contract and is part of that contract
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
and is controlled by that contract and
 
02:03:38.930 --> 02:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
it's a note negotiated item between the
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
police officers and the town I can speak
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
to one other town and the reason I can
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
do that is because uh I'm I'm after I
 
02:03:49.970 --> 02:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
retired I became an attorney so I'm
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
legal counsel for the Salem Police
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
employees Association so to use them as
 
02:03:58.070 --> 02:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
an example uh Salem Salem does have it
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the contract and Salem does
 
02:04:02.209 --> 02:04:02.219 align:start position:0%
specifically state in the contract what
 
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
the rate of pay for the actual police
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
officers will be in the contract now
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
what the town of Salem charges above and
 
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
beyond that to cover its costs I'm not
 
02:04:15.050 --> 02:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
entirely sure all right thank you thank
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
you okay so you know other questions uh
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony next we
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and fit in this chair
 
02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and fit in this chair
here

02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Michael Donahue
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
I am currently a sergeant in the traffic
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
unit for the Manchester Police
 
02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:53.870 align:start position:0%
unit for the Manchester Police
Department

02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:04:56.810 --> 02:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
I'm here in opposition to this bill and
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give a quick testimony to
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:05:01.970 --> 02:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
I've been in law enforcement for 19 and
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
a half years prior to working Manchester
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
I worked for the town of Amherst New
 
02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:06.790 align:start position:0%
I worked for the town of Amherst New
Hampshire

02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:05:09.290 --> 02:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
and being in the traffic in Manchester
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
my job is to handle motor vehicle
 
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
complaints major crashes fatal crashes
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
and develop different traffic plans for
 
02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
the school district and so on addition
 
02:05:21.290 --> 02:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
and additionally to my current position
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
I organize all of the City events in
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
Manchester that take up a public way
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
so that encompasses over 100 events a
 
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
year to include road races parades
 
02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
marathons and so on
 
02:05:35.689 --> 02:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
all of these events take numerous police
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
officers given the safety concerns of of
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
the people involved in the events
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that this bill is
 
02:05:45.530 --> 02:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
intended to save money as as was
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
testified earlier in that the savings
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
would be passed on what the bill doesn't
 
02:05:52.729 --> 02:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
address is that um
 
02:05:52.739 --> 02:05:53.930 align:start position:0%
address is that um
foreign

02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:05:56.570 --> 02:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't address and that we're not
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
thinking all the way through is that the
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
understanding of how these police
 
02:06:01.550 --> 02:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
details take mind of traffic enforcement
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
on each event as they're there so they
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to move barricades they have to
 
02:06:07.129 --> 02:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
override traffic lights and they're
 
02:06:08.890 --> 02:06:08.900 align:start position:0%
required to stop people when necessary
 
02:06:11.089 --> 02:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
sometimes people don't look at the cones
 
02:06:12.770 --> 02:06:12.780 align:start position:0%
they don't look at the manual changes or
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
physical changes you've made to the
 
02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
physical changes you've made to the
scene

02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
scene
 
02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
with over 100 events annually just
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
through the special events process never
 
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
mind the everyday details as officer
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
daily testified earlier we have 22 today
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
and there are no special events today
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
that require the public worldwide
 
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:29.830 align:start position:0%
that require the public worldwide
um

02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill allows for
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
someone like me to justify the existence
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
of a police server each time but the
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
words in it shall and only are extremely
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
powerful and leave every scenario up for
 
02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:43.739 align:start position:0%
an explanation from me in order to
 
02:06:43.739 --> 02:06:45.649 align:start position:0%
an explanation from me in order to
follow

02:06:45.649 --> 02:06:45.659 align:start position:0%
follow
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
the need for law enforcement at the
 
02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
smaller details is in order to prevent
 
02:06:51.410 --> 02:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
accidents keep the motoring public safe
 
02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
whether it be through the temporary
 
02:06:55.010 --> 02:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
physical change lane changes and so on
 
02:06:57.530 --> 02:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
stoppage of Lights further right-of-way
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
or the manual movement of traffic with
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
someone's arms the key is when drivers
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
don't obey these issues what happens
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
then with the presence of law
 
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement through lights through their
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
through their uniforms it strongly
 
02:07:13.609 --> 02:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
deters that behavior in the first place
 
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
but they're allowed to take enforcement
 
02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
action when necessary
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
um an additional thing I'd like to
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
address is the Recruitment and Retention
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
I don't want to use that term over and
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
over again because you have but it
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
specifically relates to the retirement
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
the retirement bills that changes in
 
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
2012 had a drastic effect on how they
 
02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
get paid out in pension and that's why
 
02:07:32.689 --> 02:07:32.699 align:start position:0%
the recruitment retention is the
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
conversation that we keep repeating
 
02:07:37.310 --> 02:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
the issue for using police details is
 
02:07:39.290 --> 02:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
for a police officer to earn extra extra
 
02:07:42.169 --> 02:07:42.179 align:start position:0%
money the retirement as it's called
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
Changed completely and so that officers
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
now have to have a separate set of
 
02:07:48.649 --> 02:07:48.659 align:start position:0%
investments in order to do in order to
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
retire retirement doesn't mean what it
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
meant back in 2012 so now if an officer
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
is prohibited from making extra pay
 
02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
after their 40 hours which is usually
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
what a detail will do for the police
 
02:08:02.450 --> 02:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
officer at the benefit of the City by
 
02:08:03.729 --> 02:08:03.739 align:start position:0%
having them there
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
they people will not stay on this job
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
for a length of time if you prohibit
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
them from making a livable wage in
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
retirement at the end and that's why the
 
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
recruitment retention is the argument
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
that keeps coming up and I just want
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
everybody to understand that it's the
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions have been asked this is
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
something that is voluntarily signed up
 
02:08:24.109 --> 02:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
for 90 of the time that officers take in
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
addition to their 40 hours I deal with
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
this on a regular basis it is my
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
full-time job to organize these events
 
02:08:33.050 --> 02:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
and police officers are required for
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
most of what we're dealing with here in
 
02:08:36.649 --> 02:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
the word shall and only in this prohibit
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
me from doing the job correctly
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Kellum
 
02:08:43.609 --> 02:08:43.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:08:43.619 --> 02:08:44.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
I I guess I didn't really understand
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
your full introduction are you on duty
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
and are you representing
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
um a specific department or yourself I'm
 
02:08:57.109 --> 02:08:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'm here on my own accord I gave you my
 
02:08:58.669 --> 02:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
professional accolades as I'm here
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
because I stepped away from the job to
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:09:09.290 --> 02:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um I'm starting to
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
understand the the repeat question that
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
I ask of witnesses
 
02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
um pertaining to specific safety
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about a project so projects are
 
02:09:26.990 --> 02:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
not is it true that projects are not sim
 
02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
exclusively construction projects it
 
02:09:32.570 --> 02:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
could be a marathon it could be I don't
 
02:09:34.669 --> 02:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
know some type of an event
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
correct there the the range would be
 
02:09:37.199 --> 02:09:38.510 align:start position:0%
correct there the the range would be
enormous

02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
enormous
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up regardless of the nature of
 
02:09:46.609 --> 02:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.089 --> 02:09:50.099 align:start position:0%
when you when you have a detail who is
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
it that goes in
 
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
within the municipality and for example
 
02:09:59.649 --> 02:09:59.659 align:start position:0%
sets up detours sets up the cones
 
02:10:03.050 --> 02:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
overrides traffic lights Etc is that
 
02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:05.099 align:start position:0%
always the police department or does
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
that if there's a project that's going
 
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
to utilize flaggers did they set up an
 
02:10:14.450 --> 02:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
override those types of um Traffic
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
Control Systems if you will okay so the
 
02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
Control Systems if you will okay so the
physical

02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
physical
 
02:10:21.229 --> 02:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
tools that we use columns traffic cone
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
signs and so forth if a police officer
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
there is per is provided by the city
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
using an example is the amount of road
 
02:10:30.109 --> 02:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
races and parades that Manchester has we
 
02:10:32.810 --> 02:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
use them frequently the private
 
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
companies who contract through the city
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
to do it through our special events will
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
provide cones to their own level however
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
all of the setup and takedown is done at
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the police department
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
in this situation my position as a
 
02:10:49.729 --> 02:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
traffic Sergeant I have to make sure
 
02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
that the cones are set up a certain way
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
to give certain birth to cars the
 
02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
certain width to stop different things
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
so we provide that I don't understand
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
fully what the flaggers would provide
 
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
other than the person but I don't know
 
02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
that answer
 
02:11:02.099 --> 02:11:04.370 align:start position:0%
that answer
representative

02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:11:08.089 --> 02:11:08.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
taking off a little bit on
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Powers question
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
given what you just said
 
02:11:19.370 --> 02:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
does the language in the bill
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
in your view prevent
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
local Municipal officials from
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
adequately addressing safety concerns
 
02:11:31.129 --> 02:11:31.139 align:start position:0%
before they become safety concerns
 
02:11:33.709 --> 02:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
because of the words shall and only yes
 
02:11:37.850 --> 02:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
see no more hands thank you very much
 
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.290 --> 02:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh for the committee
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
and thank the committee my name is Gary
 
02:12:01.570 --> 02:12:01.580 align:start position:0%
Abbott I'm the Executive Vice President
 
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
of the associated general contractors of
 
02:12:06.109 --> 02:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:12:08.270 --> 02:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh I wanted to clarify a couple of
 
02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
things at first I didn't know if I was
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to speak or not because I looked
 
02:12:13.609 --> 02:12:13.619 align:start position:0%
at this bill and I'm trying to figure
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
out exactly what it does now let's just
 
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
have it before we go on uh on your pink
 
02:12:20.990 --> 02:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
card you didn't put for a pose or
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
anything I did not because I'm going to
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
talk about the language of the bill that
 
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
makes it confusing and why I don't
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
really have a position at this point
 
02:12:30.119 --> 02:12:31.490 align:start position:0%
really have a position at this point
um

02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
currently there is I represent
 
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
contractors who use flaggers as well as
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
police and as well as State Police and I
 
02:12:41.810 --> 02:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
want the committee to know there's an
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate time for each of those to
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
control traffic
 
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
it is not a one or another it is based
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
on circumstances of what the road and
 
02:12:55.609 --> 02:12:55.619 align:start position:0%
what you're doing uh and that would
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
require the safety concerns
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
I think with this bill and what the past
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
study that you have was trying to
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
address is situations in which
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
an ordinance is made that mandates one
 
02:13:09.239 --> 02:13:10.729 align:start position:0%
an ordinance is made that mandates one
way

02:13:10.729 --> 02:13:10.739 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:13:13.970 --> 02:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
and doesn't look at the total project or
 
02:13:16.569 --> 02:13:16.579 align:start position:0%
the safety concerns and what's necessary
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what the Bill's
 
02:13:21.589 --> 02:13:21.599 align:start position:0%
trying to do but it has it opens up
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
safety concerns which means the town's
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
still going to decide whether who does
 
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
the detail or who does traffic control
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
the other word that's uh uh is difficult
 
02:13:36.770 --> 02:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
for me is temporary traffic control I'm
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
not sure I know the definition of
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
temporary traffic control there are
 
02:13:42.530 --> 02:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
different conditions where somebody's
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
working on a utility pole that might be
 
02:13:46.669 --> 02:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
there for an hour or two and then there
 
02:13:48.290 --> 02:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
are people in the commercial business
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
that I represent that'll be Paving a
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
road all day long for eight hours a day
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
that has either flaggers or police to
 
02:13:58.970 --> 02:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
control that so I think that's what the
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do is make it so it's
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
in the statute that you can't pick one
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
over the other each has its own place so
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring that forward to the
 
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not so sure the language
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
fixes all of that but I know that's what
 
02:14:14.290 --> 02:14:14.300 align:start position:0%
I think the study
 
02:14:16.850 --> 02:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
I know the committee keeps asking about
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
what is safety concerns well clearly
 
02:14:22.609 --> 02:14:22.619 align:start position:0%
you've been through Paving projects at
 
02:14:24.609 --> 02:14:24.619 align:start position:0%
Paving roads that's not a high volume
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
flaggers are doing the detail it's
 
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
appropriate in those cases flag is would
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
be appropriate on dead end roads for
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
utility work flaggers would be
 
02:14:36.649 --> 02:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
appropriate where we don't see the major
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
safety concern that it requires a police
 
02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:41.089 align:start position:0%
safety concern that it requires a police
detail

02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
detail
 
02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
and there's the manual on uniform
 
02:14:46.490 --> 02:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
traffic control that's put out by the
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
federal government that a lot of
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
construction follows
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it gives guidelines also dot has
 
02:14:55.250 --> 02:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
guidelines which when things are
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate for different projects so
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing that up also was talked
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
about training our association does the
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
training for flag training so I want to
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
dispel any rumors that like they're not
 
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
qualified there are requirements for
 
02:15:12.530 --> 02:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
State projects many municipalities
 
02:15:15.890 --> 02:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
follow those State projects for their
 
02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:19.619 align:start position:0%
local highways and improvements so we
 
02:15:22.609 --> 02:15:22.619 align:start position:0%
train those flat we train trainers to be
 
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
within companies there are companies
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
that do flag training so I don't want
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
you to think that's just somebody out of
 
02:15:31.129 --> 02:15:31.139 align:start position:0%
the blue or the major corporations of
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
Highway contracts have their own flag
 
02:15:36.109 --> 02:15:36.119 align:start position:0%
Crews so that can be take place so I
 
02:15:38.270 --> 02:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
want to just clarify all of those things
 
02:15:41.689 --> 02:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
so you don't misinterpret this bill that
 
02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
I think it's trying to address because
 
02:15:45.709 --> 02:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
any time that you
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
we agree safety should come first over
 
02:15:50.689 --> 02:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
all of the other things that you've
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
listened to but there are times that
 
02:15:56.810 --> 02:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's this the flagger is appropriate and
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
so therefore I just want to bring that
 
02:16:00.169 --> 02:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
to the committee I know I may have been
 
02:16:02.089 --> 02:16:02.099 align:start position:0%
close to my three minutes even though I
 
02:16:03.970 --> 02:16:03.980 align:start position:0%
wrote five before I got that instruction
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
but uh I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:16:08.330 --> 02:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
Mr Abbott no you were over your time
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
limit but that's okay
 
02:16:14.209 --> 02:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
um do we have any questions for Mr
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
Abbott uh representative thank you Mr
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
you clarified a lot of things but as I
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
see it from your testimony it says
 
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
current what's existing currently
 
02:16:33.410 --> 02:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of issues uh in terms of
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
who to use when to use at the local
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
level am I correct in understanding that
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct to a point but I
 
02:16:41.209 --> 02:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
will tell you there are disputes over
 
02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
the years of a flagging company is
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
trying to do a job and the local
 
02:16:47.270 --> 02:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
municipality comes in and says you
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
cannot do that I've received those phone
 
02:16:52.969 --> 02:16:52.979 align:start position:0%
calls regarding what Authority so we're
 
02:16:55.129 --> 02:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
into the legal authority of who has
 
02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
legal control so I'm not saying there
 
02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
isn't those disputes currently that
 
02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:01.969 align:start position:0%
isn't those disputes currently that
happen

02:17:01.969 --> 02:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:17:01.979 --> 02:17:03.950 align:start position:0%
happen
representative

02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:06.169 --> 02:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
question so the sense that I got from
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
your testimony was that the um that
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
there is some guidelines especially uh
 
02:17:17.330 --> 02:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
Federal and
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
um maybe the local municipality is not
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
utilizing those guidelines and is over
 
02:17:27.469 --> 02:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
regulating because possibly because they
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
are trying to incentivize or be able to
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
pay their officers more money and they
 
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
don't they want to be able to offer this
 
02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
option to them to get more money and so
 
02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
there's some some kind of incentive for
 
02:17:42.589 --> 02:17:42.599 align:start position:0%
them to not follow the more standard
 
02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
practice of the federal government is
 
02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
that kind of the issue that is I guess I
 
02:17:50.209 --> 02:17:50.219 align:start position:0%
guess what I want to clarify is I think
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
what happens is and I know you're the
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee but I think at times
 
02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't see the whole
 
02:17:59.330 --> 02:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
picture they don't they don't recognize
 
02:18:01.810 --> 02:18:01.820 align:start position:0%
that there should be I would like to see
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities adopt a guideline like
 
02:18:07.009 --> 02:18:07.019 align:start position:0%
what dot puts out or some guideline
 
02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:10.019 align:start position:0%
what's the appropriate use and when and
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
get away from uh the whole compensation
 
02:18:15.410 --> 02:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
thing I think that's where I come from
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
is that safety should be it use the
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are currently that
 
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
either dot follows or the manual for
 
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
uniform traffic control that does that's
 
02:18:28.310 --> 02:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
what I would recommend and I think the
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
problem is is that many municipalities
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
when they write these ordinances they
 
02:18:35.089 --> 02:18:35.099 align:start position:0%
don't write that piece I hope that
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
answers your question
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:18:42.169 --> 02:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
um and it may have already been answered
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure do qualify or your
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
organization does training and Dot has
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
guidelines is so two-part question is
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
there one standard or certification that
 
02:18:56.570 --> 02:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
all flaggers have and then
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
do those flaggers need to have all used
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
continuing education you know to to keep
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
up with standards well I I can tell you
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:19:10.610 --> 02:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
the dot writes their their standard into
 
02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
the contracts into the specifications of
 
02:19:16.730 --> 02:19:16.740 align:start position:0%
what you take and therefore come the
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
requirements so almost all the
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
organizations that teach flagging I'm
 
02:19:23.929 --> 02:19:23.939 align:start position:0%
not the only organization that teaches
 
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
flag there's certain criteria and they
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
have to go through this flagging at
 
02:19:29.509 --> 02:19:29.519 align:start position:0%
least every four years
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
so there are components to this and
 
02:19:34.129 --> 02:19:34.139 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that we as an
 
02:19:37.129 --> 02:19:37.139 align:start position:0%
association we teach this have to cover
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
and trust me dot officials Federal
 
02:19:43.129 --> 02:19:43.139 align:start position:0%
Highway have attended my classes I've
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
had police attend our classes so we've
 
02:19:48.169 --> 02:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
gone through the review and that kind of
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
thing there are also National
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
organizations that just deal with
 
02:19:54.290 --> 02:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
traffic and safety and they put on
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
courses as well locally and online so
 
02:19:59.630 --> 02:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
you can have courses but there is
 
02:20:03.170 --> 02:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
criteria it's not completely the wild
 
02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
west it there are some standards that
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
are put in place
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative state
 
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you think that the
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill as written covers all of the
 
02:20:18.530 --> 02:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
eventualities that you just clarified
 
02:20:22.250 --> 02:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
for us I I don't I I think there's some
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
gaps in what I think I understand I
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
think what the verbiage it's very brief
 
02:20:31.250 --> 02:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I'd love to see that you
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
know all of the factors taken into place
 
02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
if they're going to do a local ordinance
 
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm not so sure this does it but I
 
02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
think this does try to prevent an
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
ordinance from saying you can only do
 
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
one way
 
02:20:46.150 --> 02:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:50.750 align:start position:0%
representative priests
yes

02:20:50.750 --> 02:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:20:55.550 --> 02:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:58.490 --> 02:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
um are there any mandates that temporary
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
flaggers have to take your training and
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:07.969 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:21:07.969 --> 02:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:21:10.090 --> 02:21:10.100 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
we teach the situations in which it's
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory like working for a D.O.T
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
project and we go over what those
 
02:21:21.650 --> 02:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
specifications are or if the town adopts
 
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
those kind of specifications in say road
 
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
building a lot of times they adopt all
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the standards that are in the the dot
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
those would apply so it's it's
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's training in which it's anybody who
 
02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
is going to be probably a flagging
 
02:21:41.090 --> 02:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
company is going to make sure they've
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
trained their people in accordance with
 
02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
either a national standard or by the
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
local regs
 
02:21:50.750 --> 02:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.050 --> 02:21:53.060 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
02:21:59.450 --> 02:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
question for you sir
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
you're a construction worker and you're
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
out on 95 and you're raking asphalt
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
you want a trooper or police officer
 
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
blue light or do you want a guy holding
 
02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
a sign that says slow down
 
02:22:12.170 --> 02:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
it depends on the situation and it
 
02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
depends on the type of projects I mean
 
02:22:17.330 --> 02:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
we work with the state police a lot
 
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
because on uh highways we don't want
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
flaggers so there are different
 
02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
scenarios in which the contractor will
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
say Gary we absolutely don't want
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
flaggers in those situations
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
but I what I'm trying to cast here is
 
02:22:35.090 --> 02:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.510 --> 02:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
which would you rather have
 
02:22:45.530 --> 02:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chairman well
 
02:22:47.210 --> 02:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
never mind sir
 
02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
see no more questions I have one brief
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
one um my understanding of what you're
 
02:22:54.610 --> 02:22:54.620 align:start position:0%
saying is that there's not a
 
02:22:57.530 --> 02:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits all to win a flagger or an
 
02:22:59.270 --> 02:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
officer should be used that's my
 
02:23:00.410 --> 02:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
understanding of what you're saying
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
you're also stipulating that the current
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
language does not quite capture that
 
02:23:10.190 --> 02:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
sentiment is it do you think that you
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
would be able to draft is is it possible
 
02:23:15.410 --> 02:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
to draft language that would actually
 
02:23:20.270 --> 02:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:23.450 --> 02:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure I could do it in the
 
02:23:26.510 --> 02:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
time frame of that you were set in to to
 
02:23:27.889 --> 02:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
come up with because there was a whole
 
02:23:32.090 --> 02:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
study committee looked at it and uh
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure I could do that
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony thank
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
you and last pink card uh nature Grace
 
02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:48.710 align:start position:0%
you and last pink card uh nature Grace
foreign

02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature craze for the
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
municipal Association I do oppose this
 
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
bill I can't speak to what my
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
predecessor might have thought in 2015
 
02:23:59.210 --> 02:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
but to go directly to representative
 
02:24:01.070 --> 02:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
power's question
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
um there is vague language in this in
 
02:24:06.230 --> 02:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
this bill I do not know the meaning of
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
the term specific safety concerns and
 
02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
certainly the question of who would
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
determine that and what would the appeal
 
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
process be is something that I would
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
raise as a question as well
 
02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
to get to the chairs question
 
02:24:23.690 --> 02:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
um I uh I
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
do not know whether it would be possible
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
to draft language that would address
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
this particular issue because as Mr
 
02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
Abbott said
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
um there are certainly circumstances
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
where a non-uniformed officer is more
 
02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate and
 
02:24:40.969 --> 02:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
where a uniformed officer is more
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate so civilian or a uniformed
 
02:24:43.680 --> 02:24:44.650 align:start position:0%
appropriate so civilian or a uniformed
officer

02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:44.660 align:start position:0%
officer
 
02:24:46.849 --> 02:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be determined on the
 
02:24:49.130 --> 02:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
bait on the basis of
 
02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
the specific facts and circumstances so
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
for example uh
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
most municipalities this point in time
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
use uniformed officers for Traffic
 
02:25:03.050 --> 02:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
Control in road races and marathons
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
prior to what happened in Boston a few a
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
few years ago they did not do so because
 
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
they were not aware there might be
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
safety concerns related to that flaggers
 
02:25:15.969 --> 02:25:15.979 align:start position:0%
were more common
 
02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:18.359 align:start position:0%
although certainly uniformed officers
 
02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:21.180 align:start position:0%
were present at various times
 
02:25:22.969 --> 02:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out a couple other
 
02:25:26.330 --> 02:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
things for the committee as well
 
02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
um representative McDonald asked a
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
question about uh construction on 93 and
 
02:25:33.469 --> 02:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
on federal highways there actually is a
 
02:25:35.030 --> 02:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
specific Federal Highway administrative
 
02:25:38.770 --> 02:25:38.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
630.1106 C which requires use of
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
uniformed officers on Federal Highway
 
02:25:46.849 --> 02:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
projects I believe that has to do with
 
02:25:50.510 --> 02:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
funding of those projects
 
02:25:51.830 --> 02:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
um it's been referenced several times
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire dot has a flagger and
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
uniformed officer use in work zones
 
02:25:58.130 --> 02:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
guidelines there's also the federal
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
Manual of traffic control devices that
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
Federal Manual of traffic control
 
02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
devices is required to be used by
 
02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh as far as the flagger
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
versus uh uniformed officer comes in
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
that's really decision based on local
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
conditions and so really the the point
 
02:26:18.889 --> 02:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
is that the locals are going to know
 
02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
what the specific public safety concerns
 
02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
are in that particular Road stretch of
 
02:26:27.770 --> 02:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
highway wherever they are as well as any
 
02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:28.490 align:start position:0%
highway wherever they are as well as any
other

02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
factors that may weigh in there and they
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be the most appropriate ones to
 
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
determine what is appropriate in that
 
02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
particular circumstance that's all I
 
02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:36.990 align:start position:0%
have Mr chair
 
02:26:36.990 --> 02:26:38.929 align:start position:0%
have Mr chair
[Music]

02:26:38.929 --> 02:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you thank
 
02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question so when the
 
02:26:46.550 --> 02:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
state puts out these guidelines for when
 
02:26:49.210 --> 02:26:49.220 align:start position:0%
to use flaggers and when to use officers
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
it is it am I understanding your
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly that no in fact the
 
02:26:58.130 --> 02:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
local con the local municipality has
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
more expertise to know when that is when
 
02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
they're uh the flaggers versus uniform
 
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
officers is more appropriate and shows
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
should have the power to override what
 
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
the FED what the state has has uh deemed
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
the guidelines for this
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
so the state has guidelines they use in
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
state projects and most municipalities
 
02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
also follow those because they help
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
determine when a flagger versus
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
uniformed officer is appropriate
 
02:27:29.770 --> 02:27:29.780 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
who the ultimately it's the at the
 
02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
moment it is the local municipality that
 
02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:39.660 align:start position:0%
decides uh what is appropriate in that
 
02:27:41.690 --> 02:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
particular circumstance
 
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:27:49.610 --> 02:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the fiscal note
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
since it says you were contacted for
 
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.389 align:start position:0%
since it says you were contacted for
that

02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:53.399 --> 02:27:54.170 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:27:54.170 --> 02:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:55.849 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:27:55.849 --> 02:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
the the part about potentially
 
02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
decreasing costs I understand that makes
 
02:28:02.809 --> 02:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
sense but the sentence before that when
 
02:28:04.250 --> 02:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:05.870 align:start position:0%
it says
um

02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh talks about this may alter the
 
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
revenue accrued from special detail
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
projects could you go more into how that
 
02:28:19.730 --> 02:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
works short I'm happy to provide the
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
full fiscal note form that I filled out
 
02:28:25.490 --> 02:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
for for
 
02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:27.530 align:start position:0%
for for
uh

02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
my brain skipping here but
 
02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
um or less oh uh yeah
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
and um but the long and the short is
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
depending on exactly how this language
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
is interpreted it may be the case that
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
uniformed officers are used less
 
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
frequency frequently or perhaps more
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
frequently depending on what exactly the
 
02:28:55.150 --> 02:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
term uh specific safety concerns means
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
and that would result typically what
 
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
happens is officers have municipalities
 
02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
set up a special detail fund and that's
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
authorized under a different statute and
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
then operates to pay for the cost of
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
having an officer out there all the
 
02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
maintenance for the vehicles Etc
 
02:29:17.330 --> 02:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and so that would be uh that fund is
 
02:29:19.790 --> 02:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
held separately it's not part of usual
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations it's very specific in
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
what it can be used for that's basically
 
02:29:27.469 --> 02:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
the officer's pay retirement Etc while
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're on details and typically the
 
02:29:34.010 --> 02:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
municipality pays a or charges a set
 
02:29:35.450 --> 02:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
cost for that and it may depend on
 
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
whether there's a vehicle or not so
 
02:29:39.530 --> 02:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
depending on how this is interpreted
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
that may mean officers are used more in
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
which case they would have more Revenue
 
02:29:45.889 --> 02:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
into that fund if it's interpreted that
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
they are used less then they may have
 
02:29:49.730 --> 02:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
less Revenue I couldn't determine that
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
at the time based on the language of the
 
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
see representative management
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Greece
 
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:30:07.969 --> 02:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
can the municipality uh at this time as
 
02:30:11.570 --> 02:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
the law exists or the
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
um can they deny a construction or a
 
02:30:21.050 --> 02:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
project if they use flaggers versus the
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
police officer at this time does the
 
02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:27.540 align:start position:0%
local municipality have the authority to
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
do that with the safety and concern so
 
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't deny approval of the
 
02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
project but as the project occurs it may
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
be the case that you know someone
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
notifies the police department hey there
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
are people out there directing traffic
 
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
and it's not a police officer it may be
 
02:30:47.330 --> 02:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
the case that then you know the the
 
02:30:49.370 --> 02:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
police chief and the select board or
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
tenant administrator has a a
 
02:30:52.969 --> 02:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
conversation with that construction
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
company and typically they work that out
 
02:30:57.650 --> 02:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
ahead of time about who will be there to
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
direct traffic because that's really the
 
02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:02.230 align:start position:0%
direct traffic because that's really the
question

02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.240 align:start position:0%

you're going to introduce
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
the the private sponsor had to go to an
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
executive session could we just wait
 
02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:04.140 align:start position:0%

all day she contacted me prior and I
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
specifically asked her to have uh one of
 
02:32:16.849 --> 02:32:16.859 align:start position:0%
the other Representatives come fine I'm
 
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:22.200 align:start position:0%

Mr chair members of the committee I'm
 
02:33:00.530 --> 02:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
here today to introduce House Bill 467
 
02:33:02.990 --> 02:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
relative to public playground
 
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.210 align:start position:0%

02:33:05.210 --> 02:33:05.220 align:start position:0%
accessibility
 
02:33:07.250 --> 02:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for that introductions we have
 
02:33:12.110 --> 02:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
three pink cards we will start with uh
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.849 --> 02:33:43.859 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Chase eagleson I'm here
 
02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Council
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
on developmental disabilities we are
 
02:33:49.570 --> 02:33:49.580 align:start position:0%
here in support of the bill
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh we believe he'll have a really great
 
02:33:55.090 --> 02:33:55.100 align:start position:0%
positive impact for the spirit community
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:34:00.170 --> 02:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh for two reasons one it gives the
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
ability for parents caregivers and
 
02:34:06.610 --> 02:34:06.620 align:start position:0%
Guardians with mobility issues
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
to more easily care for and get access
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
to the children they're caring for
 
02:34:13.730 --> 02:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
and number two
 
02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:16.130 align:start position:0%
and number two
it's

02:34:16.130 --> 02:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
important for children at a young age to
 
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
socialize and play
 
02:34:22.849 --> 02:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
and this allows for children with
 
02:34:25.190 --> 02:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
mobility issues to be able to get to
 
02:34:26.450 --> 02:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
playground equipment to be able to
 
02:34:28.670 --> 02:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
utilize it be able to have fun and play
 
02:34:30.230 --> 02:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
with their friends
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
and we believe that this will have a
 
02:34:34.849 --> 02:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
great impact on the early childhood
 
02:34:37.450 --> 02:34:37.460 align:start position:0%
development of these children
 
02:34:46.730 --> 02:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:49.969 --> 02:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
question would you be open in the bill
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
if it was written that
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:02.160 --> 02:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
basically

02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
as long as people connect
 
02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
access the play structures or whatever
 
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
then that's fine it doesn't need to be
 
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
specified what type of material
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
anything that increased successfully
 
02:35:20.690 --> 02:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
before I know that this was chosen
 
02:35:23.410 --> 02:35:23.420 align:start position:0%
because most playgrounds have mulch
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
which you cannot uh use a wheelchair on
 
02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
and it's very hard to get even grounding
 
02:35:33.050 --> 02:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
on so anything that would make it easier
 
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
02:35:49.969 --> 02:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh and I and you as I
 
02:35:58.610 --> 02:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh read this bill if you have a
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
playground and uh ought to
 
02:36:04.130 --> 02:36:04.140 align:start position:0%
fulfill the requirements
 
02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
you'd almost have to cover the whole
 
02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:07.849 align:start position:0%
you'd almost have to cover the whole
surface

02:36:07.849 --> 02:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
surface
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
you it the whole surface of the
 
02:36:14.090 --> 02:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
playground you you couldn't have uh
 
02:36:17.929 --> 02:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
uh Pathways going from one to the other
 
02:36:20.450 --> 02:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
not knowing which one you pick first or
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
second or third it seemed to me that
 
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
this would require that you'd cover the
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
whole surface of the playground is that
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:34.010 --> 02:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
I it probably makes more sense to go to
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Catawba on that but I
 
02:36:39.469 --> 02:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
believe that is the uh intense uh so
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
that children with mobility issues
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
parents Guardians caregivers mobility
 
02:36:45.889 --> 02:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
issues to be able to access their
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
children and to play at any point on the
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
playground yes
 
02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:54.590 align:start position:0%
playground yes
follow-up

02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
if that is the case then don't you have
 
02:37:04.730 --> 02:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
to put in the bill the size of the
 
02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:05.770 align:start position:0%
to put in the bill the size of the
playground

02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:05.780 align:start position:0%
playground
 
02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:07.690 align:start position:0%
playground
otherwise

02:37:07.690 --> 02:37:07.700 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that if this went forward
 
02:37:14.090 --> 02:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
that would be a deterrent to people
 
02:37:16.429 --> 02:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
putting in playgrounds because it would
 
02:37:19.809 --> 02:37:19.819 align:start position:0%
cost so much to be it would be uh
 
02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence because people
 
02:37:24.889 --> 02:37:24.899 align:start position:0%
would just not put the playgrounds in
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't follow the rules
 
02:37:32.330 --> 02:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
would you be interested in changing the
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so that it would at least
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
identify the size of the playgrounds uh
 
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
I have no preference on I'm not sure the
 
02:37:43.550 --> 02:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
council has preference on it uh
 
02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't believe the size of a
 
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
playground is really something that we
 
02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
were identifying here more of just the
 
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
accessibility of the surface
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
02:37:54.290 --> 02:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
question at all
 
02:37:56.570 --> 02:37:56.580 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:37:59.469 --> 02:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
02:38:03.889 --> 02:38:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:38:06.170 --> 02:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh is there a
 
02:38:06.180 --> 02:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh is there a
condition

02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
condition
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
um under which this is required by uh
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
federal law the Ada law and and towns
 
02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
must comply when they're renovating as
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to building new I'm not sure uh
 
02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I know the Ada law would would
 
02:38:27.710 --> 02:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
back this but I am not 100 sure if
 
02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
there's a current legislation on that no
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:36.889 --> 02:38:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative treble
 
02:38:39.050 --> 02:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks very much
 
02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thanks for coming
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of testimony so I'll have
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
great reading uh I wonder if any
 
02:38:47.150 --> 02:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
research we've had bills before us in
 
02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
the past about artificial turf on
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
athletic fields and I heard some very
 
02:38:54.770 --> 02:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
disturbing research in regards to the
 
02:38:57.490 --> 02:38:57.500 align:start position:0%
toxicity because it's chopped up tires
 
02:39:00.889 --> 02:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
or other kinds of rubber in with that do
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
you have any information or comments
 
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:05.220 align:start position:0%
about the kind of rubber that might be
 
02:39:07.090 --> 02:39:07.100 align:start position:0%
used in this bill
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
I don't uh as someone who doesn't know
 
02:39:13.849 --> 02:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
much about toxicity of certain uh no
 
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
problem materials I don't know much
 
02:39:17.809 --> 02:39:17.819 align:start position:0%
about it I know in the bill it also
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
States you could use a rubber composite
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
of some sort yes
 
02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure which would be safer but
 
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
would be open to anything that's
 
02:39:30.170 --> 02:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
increased accessibility for it thanks
 
02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:31.969 align:start position:0%
increased accessibility for it thanks
thanks representative

02:39:31.969 --> 02:39:31.979 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
02:39:33.590 --> 02:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you very
 
02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question and I
 
02:39:37.010 --> 02:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
apologize in advance if it's something
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
you can't answer but as I read the
 
02:39:42.710 --> 02:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
current requirements of the Americans
 
02:39:44.929 --> 02:39:44.939 align:start position:0%
with Disabilities Act this is already
 
02:39:48.250 --> 02:39:48.260 align:start position:0%
required effectively
 
02:39:50.690 --> 02:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's required fairly in all playgrounds
 
02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
then this would just uh allow for a push
 
02:39:55.370 --> 02:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
it to be done in playgrounds throughout
 
02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:39:59.090 --> 02:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
it's required federally it's already
 
02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:00.889 align:start position:0%
it's required federally it's already
required

02:40:00.889 --> 02:40:00.899 align:start position:0%
required
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know much about the federal
 
02:40:05.330 --> 02:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
requirements of uh rubber compositor
 
02:40:07.550 --> 02:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
composite for surfacing for uh
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
playgrounds federally so I do have a
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
question for you and my question is is
 
02:40:13.849 --> 02:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
that a follow-up representative yes it's
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
a problem Mr chair thank you so much
 
02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
a problem Mr chair thank you so much
um

02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:21.950 --> 02:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
do you have experience with playgrounds
 
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire have you you
 
02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
know do you have you seen play at
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
grounds that you do consider accessible
 
02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:29.270 align:start position:0%
grounds that you do consider accessible
and

02:40:29.270 --> 02:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
if you could just give us a general
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
description of how they differ from the
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of playgrounds that this bill
 
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
seems to be addressing
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
yeah of course so uh I actually worked
 
02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
at one point at the tuck Youth Camp in
 
02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
Hampton New Hampshire and a lot of times
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
we would go to playgrounds where there
 
02:40:50.809 --> 02:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
was mulch surfacing
 
02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh which people in wheelchairs are
 
02:40:55.849 --> 02:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
unable to get over
 
02:40:57.770 --> 02:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh but there are playgrounds throughout
 
02:40:59.929 --> 02:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
this state but not all playgrounds
 
02:41:03.050 --> 02:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that have more of a smooth
 
02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:04.250 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that have more of a smooth
surfacing

02:41:04.250 --> 02:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
surfacing
 
02:41:06.410 --> 02:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
that would that allows for uh people
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
mobility issues and people in
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs to be able to get across
 
02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:12.830 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs to be able to get across
them

02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:15.770 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:41:15.770 --> 02:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell what you're asking for is
 
02:41:27.070 --> 02:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
an inclusionary playground where any
 
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
individual with any level of
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities can participate socially
 
02:41:36.710 --> 02:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
yes we believe that inclusion at a young
 
02:41:38.570 --> 02:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
age and learning inclusion of people
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
with different abilities would greatly
 
02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
Aid in the feeling of inclusion as they
 
02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:48.170 align:start position:0%
Aid in the feeling of inclusion as they
age

02:41:48.170 --> 02:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
02:41:52.250 --> 02:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:41:53.630 --> 02:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:41:53.640 --> 02:41:55.130 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
do you believe that
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
is it your opinion that the playground
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
could have a
 
02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
surface for accessibility but not have a
 
02:42:07.969 --> 02:42:07.979 align:start position:0%
complete port in place surface that
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
covers the entire area
 
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
just trying to which it which is
 
02:42:14.170 --> 02:42:14.180 align:start position:0%
permitted through the Ada
 
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
and do you believe that that's okay
 
02:42:20.270 --> 02:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
we would prefer that all areas were
 
02:42:23.270 --> 02:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
accessible to uh people with mobility
 
02:42:27.050 --> 02:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
issues and different abilities uh but I
 
02:42:28.370 --> 02:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
could get back to you on that and what
 
02:42:31.490 --> 02:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
the council believes thank you
 
02:42:33.770 --> 02:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
see no more quite representative priest
 
02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
could we wait I see the prime sponsors
 
02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
here and I know she has issues so with
 
02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:42.889 align:start position:0%
here and I know she has issues so with
scheduling

02:42:42.889 --> 02:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
02:42:44.929 --> 02:42:44.939 align:start position:0%
actually this is a question for the
 
02:42:46.670 --> 02:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
disability okay go ahead
 
02:42:48.770 --> 02:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking this
 
02:42:50.690 --> 02:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
quick question and thank you for taking
 
02:42:51.889 --> 02:42:51.899 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
with people with disabilities
 
02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between the
 
02:43:01.270 --> 02:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
surface materials concrete asphalt
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
rubberized surfaces as to how they give
 
02:43:08.570 --> 02:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
if there is an accident and the patient
 
02:43:11.570 --> 02:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
falls or the visitor Falls onto their
 
02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:13.610 align:start position:0%
falls or the visitor Falls onto their
ground

02:43:13.610 --> 02:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
ground
 
02:43:16.490 --> 02:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
I don't have much knowledge on the
 
02:43:19.010 --> 02:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
physics of uh injuries when someone
 
02:43:20.929 --> 02:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
Falls onto a surface I'm sure that
 
02:43:23.570 --> 02:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
cement is much harder and rubber has a
 
02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
little bit more give uh when some if
 
02:43:28.610 --> 02:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
someone were to fall onto it but I can
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
try to get back to you on that if
 
02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:33.230 align:start position:0%
try to get back to you on that if
possible

02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:35.210 --> 02:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony uh
 
02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony uh
representative

02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:43:47.809 --> 02:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:47.819 --> 02:44:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:06.230 --> 02:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
scheduling issues I had exact session so
 
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
House Bill 467
 
02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
seeks to make new playgrounds accessible
 
02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
only on the pathways to get to the
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
equipment and I do want to clarify that
 
02:44:21.590 --> 02:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is a federal law and it has been
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the last 11 years
 
02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.790 align:start position:0%
for the last 11 years
however

02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
the federal law points to an ASTM
 
02:44:33.550 --> 02:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
standard which defines that in order for
 
02:44:36.290 --> 02:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
the path to be considered handicap
 
02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:38.090 align:start position:0%
the path to be considered handicap
accessible

02:44:38.090 --> 02:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:44:40.610 --> 02:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
you have to exert more no more than
 
02:44:44.389 --> 02:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
seven percent more Force as you would if
 
02:44:48.349 --> 02:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
you were on a flat surface and so
 
02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
Danny of you know how to measure that
 
02:44:51.170 --> 02:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
because I certainly don't it doesn't
 
02:44:53.570 --> 02:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
give an actual answer for which
 
02:44:55.130 --> 02:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
piece of material that you need to
 
02:44:57.530 --> 02:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
accomplish that and so towns are
 
02:44:57.540 --> 02:44:58.490 align:start position:0%
accomplish that and so towns are
building

02:44:58.490 --> 02:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:45:00.170 --> 02:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
what they think will work they're
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
getting quotes and then it turns out
 
02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
that it's not handicap accessible and
 
02:45:06.889 --> 02:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
then they're required to fix it because
 
02:45:09.050 --> 02:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
they didn't meet the federal law so in
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
my town in Windham we're doing that at
 
02:45:13.070 --> 02:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
two of our different playgrounds and our
 
02:45:15.050 --> 02:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
elementary school is estimated to be
 
02:45:17.450 --> 02:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
fixed at a cost of a half million
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and it was just built a few
 
02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
years ago if we had gotten it right the
 
02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
first time we wouldn't be having to do
 
02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
that and those kids would have been able
 
02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
to use the playground
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
I do want to mention that the analysis
 
02:45:33.170 --> 02:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
although it says that it's for
 
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
playgrounds in use on or after that's
 
02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
incorrect it is only for for playgrounds
 
02:45:42.290 --> 02:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
that are constructed after the date
 
02:45:44.690 --> 02:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I did speak to OLS about it they
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
said that it doesn't affect the the bill
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
at all that's just their blurb the
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
person who wrote it has since retired
 
02:45:53.330 --> 02:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
they didn't think that it it doesn't
 
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
affect the actual bill itself so there
 
02:45:55.849 --> 02:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
was no reason for me to make an
 
02:45:58.849 --> 02:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
amendment to to clarify that
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the bill does allow for
 
02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:04.849 align:start position:0%
um the bill does allow for
other

02:46:04.849 --> 02:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:46:04.859 --> 02:46:05.870 align:start position:0%
other
um

02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:07.790 --> 02:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
similar surface material that's not
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
loose fell so I know there was a
 
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
question about cheaper materials that's
 
02:46:13.190 --> 02:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
certainly allowed I know that rap
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
priests had a question about fall
 
02:46:18.889 --> 02:46:18.899 align:start position:0%
attenuation and that is covered by some
 
02:46:21.349 --> 02:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the standards so in a fall zone where
 
02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
you might be falling off of a swing or a
 
02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
slide or something like that there are
 
02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
requirements that it has to have a
 
02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:30.050 align:start position:0%
requirements that it has to have a
certain

02:46:30.050 --> 02:46:30.060 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:46:31.849 --> 02:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
attenuation to the child is not going to
 
02:46:34.670 --> 02:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
get hurt and so what I'm really looking
 
02:46:37.309 --> 02:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
to do is to basically clarify
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can understand what's the
 
02:46:41.330 --> 02:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
intent behind the federal law so that we
 
02:46:43.250 --> 02:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
don't keep making mistakes and having
 
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
kids that can't use the playground and B
 
02:46:49.010 --> 02:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
having to pay to fix that afterwards
 
02:46:51.410 --> 02:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of you know when we're
 
02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
asking the town a lot of towns will put
 
02:46:55.370 --> 02:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
on a warrant article you know the cost
 
02:46:57.170 --> 02:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
to build a playground and the voters
 
02:46:59.330 --> 02:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
vote for it and then they come back
 
02:47:01.250 --> 02:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
afterwards and they say well now we're
 
02:47:03.050 --> 02:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
legally obligated under federal law to
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
fix it because we we messed up and we
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.250 --> 02:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is
 
02:47:19.730 --> 02:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
um when a municipality decides to
 
02:47:21.650 --> 02:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
install a playground
 
02:47:23.870 --> 02:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
who does the design of the playground
 
02:47:26.929 --> 02:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
and is there someone designing this
 
02:47:29.469 --> 02:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
playground to be
 
02:47:31.969 --> 02:47:31.979 align:start position:0%
compliant with this the federal law
 
02:47:34.490 --> 02:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's been referenced
 
02:47:36.170 --> 02:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
they a lot of times will get different
 
02:47:39.290 --> 02:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
quotes and the thing is is that while
 
02:47:41.090 --> 02:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
you may have a material that when it's
 
02:47:43.610 --> 02:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
first put on will pass the standard and
 
02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper so they're putting that out
 
02:47:47.929 --> 02:47:47.939 align:start position:0%
there because it's a cheaper bed they
 
02:47:49.790 --> 02:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
want to get the bid on the playground
 
02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
in New England as you know we have you
 
02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
know lots of unpredictable weather and
 
02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
so unless you have maintenance staff to
 
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
literally break it flat every single day
 
02:48:03.469 --> 02:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
um like the engineering wood fiber for
 
02:48:03.479 --> 02:48:04.849 align:start position:0%
um like the engineering wood fiber for
example

02:48:04.849 --> 02:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
you can't it doesn't meet this
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
requirement and so most people don't
 
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
staff in their towns to literally have
 
02:48:16.010 --> 02:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
it flattened out that and it also that
 
02:48:17.510 --> 02:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
breaks down quite a bit because of our
 
02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
New England weather it disintegrates
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and so yes they they do have people
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
putting it out there
 
02:48:28.490 --> 02:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
um in terms of quotes but I don't think
 
02:48:30.230 --> 02:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not pointing out to
 
02:48:32.570 --> 02:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
the town like hey by the way if you
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
choose this option you're going to have
 
02:48:36.050 --> 02:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
to keep breaking it like at our
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
elementary school if they wanted to use
 
02:48:39.410 --> 02:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
like the engineering wood fiber for
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
example they would literally have to
 
02:48:42.650 --> 02:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
rake it after every recess because it
 
02:48:48.410 --> 02:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:48:52.550 --> 02:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative it's nice to see you and
 
02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
hear you explain
 
02:48:57.530 --> 02:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
um although the gentleman before you did
 
02:48:59.630 --> 02:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
well I'm wondering if you all thought
 
02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
about considering speaking to a physical
 
02:49:04.429 --> 02:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
therapist or someone who works with
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
folks who use adaptive materials to hone
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
in on this seven percent more accessible
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
power use I know that ski areas have
 
02:49:18.170 --> 02:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
adaptive skiing and they may be able to
 
02:49:19.730 --> 02:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
answer that kind of a question I wonder
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
if you considered that
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
so I I did speak with several in the
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
disability community and it's not that
 
02:49:29.090 --> 02:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
you can't make somebody else adapt their
 
02:49:30.889 --> 02:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
device to meet that your playground has
 
02:49:33.050 --> 02:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
to meet that criteria and so I suggested
 
02:49:35.870 --> 02:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
materials that do meet that criteria but
 
02:49:38.929 --> 02:49:38.939 align:start position:0%
then I did also say or a similar solid
 
02:49:40.910 --> 02:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
surf material surface material so if
 
02:49:42.290 --> 02:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's something better like I know the
 
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
town of Exeter came out and told me that
 
02:49:46.370 --> 02:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
they were using these mats which were
 
02:49:49.490 --> 02:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
pretty cheap that were interlock mats
 
02:49:50.929 --> 02:49:50.939 align:start position:0%
they put them up on their on their
 
02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
playground and they were able to fix it
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
in that way so there certainly are many
 
02:49:57.230 --> 02:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
alternatives to this available that can
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
be economical thank you
 
02:50:03.469 --> 02:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie next
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:07.070 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

02:50:07.070 --> 02:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:50:09.349 --> 02:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern would you believe
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
that my biggest concern about this that
 
02:50:14.929 --> 02:50:14.939 align:start position:0%
we may have regulated ourselves to the
 
02:50:17.750 --> 02:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
point we're going to have an unintended
 
02:50:20.990 --> 02:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
consequence and not build playgrounds
 
02:50:25.309 --> 02:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.889 --> 02:50:27.899 align:start position:0%
so no because I believe right now we
 
02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
have the unintended consequence that
 
02:50:31.730 --> 02:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
we're having to fix the playgrounds that
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
we do build because they don't meet the
 
02:50:35.809 --> 02:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
requirements and so then taxpayers are
 
02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
forced to then fund to fix it and so I
 
02:50:39.889 --> 02:50:39.899 align:start position:0%
think we already have the unintended
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
consequence and I think we need to keep
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
in mind that it's it's also not even
 
02:50:46.190 --> 02:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
just children it can be caretakers of
 
02:50:48.170 --> 02:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
children that are trying to take their
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
kids out to the playground and they may
 
02:50:51.530 --> 02:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
have a wheelchair themselves or a walker
 
02:50:53.389 --> 02:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
and they also can't navigate in these
 
02:50:54.950 --> 02:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
environments so it's not even just the
 
02:50:57.770 --> 02:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
kids but it's just you know a complete
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
inaccessibility issue and so I think
 
02:51:02.090 --> 02:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
with the amount of times that it's being
 
02:51:04.490 --> 02:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
raised I think we already have an
 
02:51:06.950 --> 02:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence that
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
towns are voting these playgrounds in
 
02:51:10.490 --> 02:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
and then the taxpayers are paying to fix
 
02:51:10.500 --> 02:51:13.570 align:start position:0%
and then the taxpayers are paying to fix
them

02:51:13.570 --> 02:51:13.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
based on that then uh
 
02:51:19.610 --> 02:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
if we already have the unintended
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
consequence this does not solve it just
 
02:51:25.849 --> 02:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
just identifies it and makes it to a
 
02:51:28.610 --> 02:51:28.620 align:start position:0%
point where now everybody knows what the
 
02:51:31.550 --> 02:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
rules are and the rules are so regulated
 
02:51:35.230 --> 02:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
do you believe that we can that as the
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
I'm unintended kind of consequences
 
02:51:41.929 --> 02:51:41.939 align:start position:0%
classic words of let's not build any
 
02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
more playgrounds because they're too
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
expensive and we want to have only
 
02:51:52.250 --> 02:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
playgrounds that are very limited in
 
02:51:56.269 --> 02:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
size and so in uh builds just separate
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
for those people who are handicapped no
 
02:52:01.370 --> 02:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so because the town of
 
02:52:02.990 --> 02:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
Concord is upgrading their playground
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
right now to be accessible on the town
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
of Exeter just upgraded upgraded theirs
 
02:52:10.010 --> 02:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
there are certain requirements for
 
02:52:12.650 --> 02:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
schools for example to have outdoor play
 
02:52:14.990 --> 02:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
areas for the kids and so I don't think
 
02:52:16.250 --> 02:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
that schools just aren't going to have
 
02:52:19.130 --> 02:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
playgrounds as a result so I don't know
 
02:52:20.510 --> 02:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that will happen and I
 
02:52:21.469 --> 02:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
believe that there are many
 
02:52:23.570 --> 02:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
cost-effective options and this doesn't
 
02:52:25.490 --> 02:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
seek to make the entire playground
 
02:52:28.370 --> 02:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
handicap accessible this this states
 
02:52:31.969 --> 02:52:31.979 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be Pathways
 
02:52:35.090 --> 02:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
um from the entry into the pieces of the
 
02:52:36.650 --> 02:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
playground equipment but you may have
 
02:52:38.990 --> 02:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know a huge area of playground but
 
02:52:41.210 --> 02:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
you're not required to make each piece
 
02:52:43.849 --> 02:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
this material it's just that the piece
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
is leading up the child needs to have a
 
02:52:48.290 --> 02:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
pathway representative thank you thank
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank thank you Mr chair
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I'm
 
02:52:53.450 --> 02:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
still trying to wrap my head around how
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
this dovetails with the Ada
 
02:52:59.210 --> 02:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
and in the language of the bill
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
in line five it says in addition to
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
meeting general safety standards in Ada
 
02:53:05.279 --> 02:53:06.650 align:start position:0%
meeting general safety standards in Ada
standards

02:53:06.650 --> 02:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:08.090 align:start position:0%
standards
so

02:53:08.090 --> 02:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
are the things that you're outlining in
 
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
this bill on top of what the Ada already
 
02:53:16.370 --> 02:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
requires and if that's the case then
 
02:53:18.710 --> 02:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
what specifically are those things that
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
the Ada doesn't require but this bill
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
proposes to require
 
02:53:26.090 --> 02:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
so the Ada requires that you have to
 
02:53:29.929 --> 02:53:29.939 align:start position:0%
have the accessible Pathways it just
 
02:53:32.450 --> 02:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define what that material that
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that pathway has to be made out of and
 
02:53:35.809 --> 02:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
in different areas of the country
 
02:53:38.809 --> 02:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
different things may work in our area of
 
02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
the country it's basically been shown
 
02:53:43.010 --> 02:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
this is the solution to make it work
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
this is what our municipalities and what
 
02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
our schools are up updating their
 
02:53:49.490 --> 02:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
playgrounds to be
 
02:53:51.290 --> 02:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful representative
 
02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:52.550 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful representative

Cahill
 
02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:53:55.849 --> 02:53:55.859 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:53:59.330 --> 02:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
I I have a good friend who became a
 
02:54:01.490 --> 02:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
paraplegic who was a skateboarder
 
02:54:03.110 --> 02:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
he still skateboards he has a special
 
02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:04.670 align:start position:0%
he still skateboards he has a special
wheelchair

02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
wheelchair
 
02:54:07.190 --> 02:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
I kind of want to know does playground
 
02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
include skate parks stuff like that
 
02:54:12.469 --> 02:54:12.479 align:start position:0%
because that has to be a
 
02:54:14.750 --> 02:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
hard material
 
02:54:17.330 --> 02:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
no because it's specifying playground
 
02:54:20.750 --> 02:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
specifically so no it would it's just a
 
02:54:22.610 --> 02:54:22.620 align:start position:0%
public playground and so this also
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to private playground
 
02:54:28.190 --> 02:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
areas in terms of if your development
 
02:54:30.590 --> 02:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
has a homeowners association that has
 
02:54:33.050 --> 02:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
built their own private playground this
 
02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to that this applies only
 
02:54:39.710 --> 02:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:41.870 --> 02:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
02:54:43.550 --> 02:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:54:45.290 --> 02:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:47.210 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:50.690 --> 02:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
a lot of towns have impact fees for
 
02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
development that go into a recreation
 
02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
revolving fund as well as
 
02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:57.230 align:start position:0%
revolving fund as well as
um

02:54:57.230 --> 02:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
just Parks and Rec funds that
 
02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:02.210 align:start position:0%
just Parks and Rec funds that
um

02:55:02.210 --> 02:55:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:04.969 --> 02:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
fees go into to do just this kind of
 
02:55:06.889 --> 02:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
thing is that something you've commonly
 
02:55:10.010 --> 02:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
seen that it doesn't take the taxpayers
 
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
money it takes the who is using the
 
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
place to fund new new projects like this
 
02:55:22.450 --> 02:55:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
so in my looking it's typically a warned
 
02:55:27.230 --> 02:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
article on the ballot and they'll
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
usually specify where the funds may or
 
02:55:32.450 --> 02:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
may not be coming from so yes they
 
02:55:35.570 --> 02:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
certainly could use those funds to apply
 
02:55:36.830 --> 02:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
to this if that's what they had them
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:46.849 --> 02:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I was wondering
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
if I was blacklisted Mr chair thank you
 
02:55:53.570 --> 02:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
for giving me an opportunity yeah
 
02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:54.650 align:start position:0%
for giving me an opportunity yeah
um

02:55:54.650 --> 02:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:56:01.130 --> 02:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
by increasing the safety of the
 
02:56:04.429 --> 02:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
playground whether it is for people with
 
02:56:07.870 --> 02:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
disability or adaptive equipment
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
that also increases the safety for
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
everybody that's using the playground
 
02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.610 --> 02:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct so it was also
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention that several
 
02:56:23.210 --> 02:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
preschools even with kids that are
 
02:56:24.769 --> 02:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
typical kids
 
02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
frequently have Falls tripping on other
 
02:56:29.630 --> 02:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
types of materials that
 
02:56:32.090 --> 02:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen nearly as regularly as
 
02:56:37.370 --> 02:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:37.380 --> 02:56:38.809 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:56:38.809 --> 02:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know our playgrounds
 
02:56:49.370 --> 02:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:52.010 --> 02:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge not not against the
 
02:56:52.020 --> 02:56:53.210 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge not not against the
the

02:56:53.210 --> 02:56:53.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:56:57.170 --> 02:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.150 --> 02:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:57:01.849 --> 02:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:57:03.889 --> 02:57:03.899 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious about the the timing and
 
02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
the dates the question is my thought is
 
02:57:08.570 --> 02:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
why not make it effective immediately
 
02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
and I ask that maybe this maybe this
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen but uh so many towns
 
02:57:15.889 --> 02:57:15.899 align:start position:0%
across the state have set their budgets
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
and they would go into effect after the
 
02:57:21.050 --> 02:57:21.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal year starts on July 1st they may
 
02:57:23.630 --> 02:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
be prepared only for what they have
 
02:57:25.849 --> 02:57:25.859 align:start position:0%
budgeted for which would not comply here
 
02:57:29.090 --> 02:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
but would still be compliant if they did
 
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
it in this fiscal in this calendar year
 
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious why not make it effective
 
02:57:35.870 --> 02:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
immediately was there any thought to
 
02:57:35.880 --> 02:57:37.969 align:start position:0%
immediately was there any thought to
that

02:57:37.969 --> 02:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:40.730 --> 02:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
so this says that constructed for use on
 
02:57:43.370 --> 02:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
or after January 1st 2024 the reason
 
02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I had put that out there was to
 
02:57:47.450 --> 02:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
give towns who maybe already had
 
02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:48.590 align:start position:0%
give towns who maybe already had
something

02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:48.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
going in although it's not compliant and
 
02:57:51.889 --> 02:57:51.899 align:start position:0%
they should probably switch up their
 
02:57:51.899 --> 02:57:52.849 align:start position:0%
they should probably switch up their
plans

02:57:52.849 --> 02:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
plans
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
um that it wouldn't mandate that they
 
02:57:56.809 --> 02:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
had to although yes like you suggested
 
02:57:58.790 --> 02:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
it would certainly behoove them to
 
02:57:59.809 --> 02:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
follow it the right way because they're
 
02:58:01.190 --> 02:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
only just going to end up having to fix
 
02:58:03.410 --> 02:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
it I'd be
 
02:58:06.650 --> 02:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know certainly in in support of of
 
02:58:08.330 --> 02:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
modifying the date if you feel that
 
02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:09.349 align:start position:0%
modifying the date if you feel that
that's

02:58:09.349 --> 02:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:58:13.130 --> 02:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:15.230 --> 02:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%

appreciate it call uh Jennifer Bertrand

um
 
02:58:56.090 --> 02:58:56.100 align:start position:0%
to hear my testimony today I am a mother
 
02:58:58.790 --> 02:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
of four children and my younger now
 
02:59:01.429 --> 02:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
adult daughter Chloe experiences a
 
02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
disability and when she was in Middle
 
02:59:06.349 --> 02:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
School she ended up needing a very
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
involved orthopedic surgery where she
 
02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
had to have her heel cords lengthened
 
02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
and her tendons transferred and for more
 
02:59:16.370 --> 02:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
than eight weeks she was in a long leg
 
02:59:18.969 --> 02:59:18.979 align:start position:0%
cast and had to use a wheelchair
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
and it was very difficult because during
 
02:59:24.050 --> 02:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
that time and it was only you know a
 
02:59:26.450 --> 02:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
little over eight weeks that she
 
02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
had to use the wheelchair to be mobile
 
02:59:30.969 --> 02:59:30.979 align:start position:0%
and get around
 
02:59:33.530 --> 02:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
there were no local playgrounds where we
 
02:59:36.830 --> 02:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
lived that would allow her access and
 
02:59:38.750 --> 02:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity at a time where she really
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
needed to get outside and be around kids
 
02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
and it really would have helped to
 
02:59:43.500 --> 02:59:44.330 align:start position:0%
and it really would have helped to
um

02:59:44.330 --> 02:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:46.130 --> 02:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
past that time that she went through
 
02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
this recovery process more quickly we'd
 
02:59:52.250 --> 02:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
have to drive down to South Nashua there
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
was a playground off of exit one near
 
02:59:57.769 --> 02:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
the sky metal Meadow Country Club and it
 
03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
had a design just like is outlined in
 
03:00:04.490 --> 03:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
this legislation where from the entrance
 
03:00:06.889 --> 03:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
around the perimeter of the playground
 
03:00:09.290 --> 03:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
into each piece of equipment there was a
 
03:00:12.170 --> 03:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
hard surface let me tell you it was very
 
03:00:14.210 --> 03:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
handy no pun intended or maybe pun
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
intended for me having one hand and
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
pushing her in the wheelchair to have
 
03:00:20.750 --> 03:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
that surface Not only was it important
 
03:00:23.690 --> 03:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
to her because it provided her a pathway
 
03:00:25.969 --> 03:00:25.979 align:start position:0%
to be able to access the playground with
 
03:00:28.849 --> 03:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
kids with and without disabilities but
 
03:00:30.769 --> 03:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
it also allowed me to be able to take
 
03:00:32.510 --> 03:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
her there and for her to enjoy that
 
03:00:34.849 --> 03:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
experience Chloe experiences an
 
03:00:36.050 --> 03:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
intellectual and developmental
 
03:00:38.450 --> 03:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
disability she loves swinging even today
 
03:00:40.090 --> 03:00:40.100 align:start position:0%
she's an adult
 
03:00:43.730 --> 03:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
and those opportunities to socialize
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
with kids in the playground it helped
 
03:00:47.929 --> 03:00:47.939 align:start position:0%
her to build her communication skills
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
her fine and gross motor skills her
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
coordination skills learn problem
 
03:00:55.309 --> 03:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
solving skills it's so important that we
 
03:00:57.950 --> 03:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
take a universal approach
 
03:01:00.190 --> 03:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
when we're designing public spaces
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't tax paying Citizens homeowners
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
that pay property taxes be able to
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
access the public spaces in their
 
03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.429 align:start position:0%
access the public spaces in their
communities

03:01:10.429 --> 03:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.349 --> 03:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like the feel-good side
 
03:01:14.510 --> 03:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
of this right but there's also a very
 
03:01:17.170 --> 03:01:17.180 align:start position:0%
important cost
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
consideration I know that representative
 
03:01:21.769 --> 03:01:21.779 align:start position:0%
Guthrie had expressed some concerns well
 
03:01:24.469 --> 03:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
if we pass this legislation we'll you
 
03:01:27.370 --> 03:01:27.380 align:start position:0%
know towns be reluctant to build
 
03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
playgrounds well it will that will this
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
passing this bill make it more expensive
 
03:01:34.370 --> 03:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
on the back of my testimony I don't know
 
03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
if you've noticed but
 
03:01:37.730 --> 03:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
I included some information about
 
03:01:40.490 --> 03:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
engineered wood fiber which is actually
 
03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
used at the Mont Vernon Village School
 
03:01:46.370 --> 03:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
playground right now if Chloe were still
 
03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
in a wheelchair she wouldn't be able to
 
03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
access the equipment or the swings or
 
03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
for other students who use wheelchairs
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to access it or
 
03:01:58.550 --> 03:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
veterans grandparents other adults that
 
03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
might experience disabilities it's not
 
03:02:03.050 --> 03:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
an exclusive Club any one of us could
 
03:02:04.849 --> 03:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
have an injury and an illness that
 
03:02:07.070 --> 03:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
require us to have an assistive device
 
03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:08.410 align:start position:0%
require us to have an assistive device
or

03:02:08.410 --> 03:02:08.420 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
you know need to use a wheelchair
 
03:02:15.170 --> 03:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
the engineered wood fiber
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
is very costly the um
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
dust that is emitted from the material
 
03:02:27.230 --> 03:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
can also be problem some to allergy
 
03:02:31.730 --> 03:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
sufferers and I like the way that the
 
03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
representatives outline this bill
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
leaving it sufficiently open to use an
 
03:02:40.250 --> 03:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
alternative material so this bill really
 
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
provides guidance to help towns to make
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
cost-effective decisions
 
03:02:48.170 --> 03:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
and it also gives towns the flexibility
 
03:02:51.769 --> 03:02:51.779 align:start position:0%
and choice to choose materials that are
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
most appropriate for their communities
 
03:02:59.929 --> 03:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to support HB 467 and let's
 
03:03:02.210 --> 03:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
work together to make our communities
 
03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone
 
03:03:04.680 --> 03:03:06.050 align:start position:0%
accessible to everyone
questions

03:03:06.050 --> 03:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:03:08.690 --> 03:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi
 
03:03:14.330 --> 03:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
my question I'll ask you again thank you
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's my constituents and that's my
 
03:03:21.889 --> 03:03:21.899 align:start position:0%
ward which you're talking Roby Park and
 
03:03:25.610 --> 03:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad that we have that and my
 
03:03:29.389 --> 03:03:29.399 align:start position:0%
question is again this will bring an
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
inclusionary public space for any
 
03:03:34.910 --> 03:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
ability any
 
03:03:37.010 --> 03:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
skill level
 
03:03:37.020 --> 03:03:39.050 align:start position:0%
skill level
quote

03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
quote
 
03:03:40.389 --> 03:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
03:03:43.490 --> 03:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
both for the children as well as the
 
03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
caregivers or the accompanying adult
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
correct it makes inclusionary for all
 
03:03:52.309 --> 03:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a Universal Design no matter
 
03:03:54.050 --> 03:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
what your abilities are and if you're a
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
mother who also has other children in a
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
baby stroller and you're trying to
 
03:03:59.929 --> 03:03:59.939 align:start position:0%
follow maybe your older child around and
 
03:04:01.490 --> 03:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
you have an infant that's napping in the
 
03:04:02.929 --> 03:04:02.939 align:start position:0%
stroller it certainly makes it more easy
 
03:04:06.170 --> 03:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
for moms or dads who bring their
 
03:04:07.910 --> 03:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
children to the playground or
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
grandparents who are you know caring and
 
03:04:11.870 --> 03:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
providing some child care for working
 
03:04:11.880 --> 03:04:13.130 align:start position:0%
providing some child care for working
parents

03:04:13.130 --> 03:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win for everyone and it's
 
03:04:17.870 --> 03:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
more cost effective I think sometimes
 
03:04:19.849 --> 03:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
when towns make the decision to use
 
03:04:21.769 --> 03:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
something like engineered wood fiber
 
03:04:23.929 --> 03:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
like Mont Vernon did and other towns
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
have done they don't realize the
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs and the fact that
 
03:04:30.650 --> 03:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
unless it is raked out you know in some
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
cases on a daily basis it's not
 
03:04:35.450 --> 03:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
accessible and they could face legal
 
03:04:37.730 --> 03:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
repercussions that could be far more
 
03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
costly down the road so let's take an
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
informed approach and this legislation
 
03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
will enable us to do that thank you you
 
03:04:46.610 --> 03:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
answered the question a while ago thank
 
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
03:04:50.330 --> 03:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh further questions seeing none thank
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh final speaker
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:02.150 --> 03:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and each crease for
 
03:05:03.650 --> 03:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association we are in
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
um as as already stated uh this is
 
03:05:09.410 --> 03:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
already federal law and I just want to
 
03:05:11.690 --> 03:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
point you to uh the Ada standards for
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
accessible design adopted in 2010 there
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
are three requirements for playgrounds
 
03:05:18.050 --> 03:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
they have to have an accessible path
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
from the building or parking lot to the
 
03:05:22.250 --> 03:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
edge of the play area they have to have
 
03:05:23.870 --> 03:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
an accessible path from the edge of the
 
03:05:25.870 --> 03:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
play area to the playground equipment
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
and surfaces have to comply with atsm
 
03:05:32.090 --> 03:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
1951 which is the surface systems for
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
under and around playground equipment
 
03:05:37.010 --> 03:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I want to thank representative kutab
 
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
for doing an incredible amount of
 
03:05:40.490 --> 03:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
research on this
 
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
um because as it happens not all of the
 
03:05:45.410 --> 03:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
surfacing materials contained within
 
03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
that atsm are actually appropriate for
 
03:05:50.809 --> 03:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or usable and
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
as a result municipalities are
 
03:05:55.010 --> 03:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
Contracting out to
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
either build new playgrounds or
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
substantially redesign
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
um and rebuild existing playgrounds
 
03:06:03.650 --> 03:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
relying on the representations provided
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
to them by contractors and those they
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
contract with to provide advice and as
 
03:06:12.290 --> 03:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
you've heard in in Windham and in other
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
locations uh the result is they're
 
03:06:15.950 --> 03:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
installing playgrounds that don't comply
 
03:06:17.929 --> 03:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
with the Ada they'll be notified that
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
they don't comply and then they're
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
having to go back and redo that in order
 
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
to avoid lawsuits so that's all I have
 
03:06:26.230 --> 03:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:06:28.610 --> 03:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:06:32.690 --> 03:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Grace so my
 
03:06:34.610 --> 03:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
question pertains to
 
03:06:36.969 --> 03:06:36.979 align:start position:0%
um the use the specification
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
specification of the use of resilient
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
rubber or urethane rubber calm composite
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
surfacing so my I'm wondering with
 
03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill are you aware of
 
03:06:52.250 --> 03:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
any research that was done that takes in
 
03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
that considers the environmental impacts
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
of the use of these materials and I
 
03:06:59.330 --> 03:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
asked that because in my town Brookline
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
there is a playground on a beach which
 
03:07:06.769 --> 03:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
is literally within feet of a lake so I
 
03:07:09.290 --> 03:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
have concerns with this and and those
 
03:07:12.230 --> 03:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
impacts so I actually called the sponsor
 
03:07:14.090 --> 03:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
and asked her a very similar question
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
and she pointed out that the line
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
continues or similar resilient solid
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
safe material so you could pick another
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
material other than those those were
 
03:07:24.530 --> 03:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
just her preference I also pointed out
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
that um the EPA and various
 
03:07:32.510 --> 03:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate federal agencies are doing
 
03:07:35.150 --> 03:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
an ongoing study on crumb rubber infill
 
03:07:38.330 --> 03:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
which is a type of surface material that
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
may be used that may have health impacts
 
03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
there's no result of that yet it's just
 
03:07:46.730 --> 03:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
an ongoing study so I I flagged that in
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note as well just to make
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
that aware but
 
03:07:53.450 --> 03:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's there's a positive
 
03:07:55.490 --> 03:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
and negatives with with any of these
 
03:07:58.250 --> 03:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.889 --> 03:08:00.899 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman um short
 
03:08:03.840 --> 03:08:04.929 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman um short
question

03:08:04.929 --> 03:08:04.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
do you think this is necessary
 
03:08:12.650 --> 03:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:15.889 --> 03:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
where Federal requirements are buried
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
within Federal rules and regulations so
 
03:08:21.769 --> 03:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
that it's hard for the average uh select
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
board member to find them I think that
 
03:08:25.250 --> 03:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to incorporate
 
03:08:28.010 --> 03:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
those into state law thank you
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly thank you thank you
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
for taking the question isn't
 
03:08:35.450 --> 03:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
um this law more restrictive than the
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines in that there are
 
03:08:40.910 --> 03:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
some things that would be loose
 
03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:42.349 align:start position:0%
some things that would be loose
um

03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:45.410 --> 03:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
like the engineer would products that
 
03:08:47.090 --> 03:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed under this because
 
03:08:50.090 --> 03:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
it's not loose in this this law is
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
requiring a solid surface
 
03:08:54.889 --> 03:08:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
under atsm 1951 as I understand it that
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
may be an appropriate surfacing material
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
but only in certain uses so it may be
 
03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
the case is in New Hampshire where our
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
weather affects how that material
 
03:09:12.110 --> 03:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
stays or comes together after initially
 
03:09:13.969 --> 03:09:13.979 align:start position:0%
constructed and requires ongoing
 
03:09:16.490 --> 03:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
maintenance that
 
03:09:20.150 --> 03:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
it may no longer be a qualified material
 
03:09:21.889 --> 03:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
under the federal guidelines which is
 
03:09:24.290 --> 03:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
where municipalities run into trouble as
 
03:09:29.450 --> 03:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
03:09:32.889 --> 03:09:32.899 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:09:37.250 --> 03:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh one further follow-up on the state
 
03:09:40.090 --> 03:09:40.100 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
03:09:42.650 --> 03:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
distinction so
 
03:09:42.660 --> 03:09:43.610 align:start position:0%
distinction so
um

03:09:43.610 --> 03:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
if the Americans with Disabilities Act
 
03:09:50.450 --> 03:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
Were Somehow repealed at the federal
 
03:09:54.830 --> 03:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
level this legislation would still take
 
03:09:59.750 --> 03:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
yes I believe that's the case
 
03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:07.309 --> 03:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
03:10:10.490 --> 03:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairs uh in the
 
03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
blue sheet I have three individuals
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
signed up looks like two out of the
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
three spoke in favor
 
03:10:18.769 --> 03:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
and with that will close the hearing on
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
HP 467 our next hearing begins in 15
 
03:26:07.190 --> 03:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:43.790 align:start position:0%
 
hmm

03:27:43.790 --> 03:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:45.469 --> 03:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
he's probably not to come up with it
 
03:27:49.370 --> 03:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah we have it we have it
 
03:27:51.650 --> 03:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back everybody I'm gonna
 
03:27:53.290 --> 03:27:53.300 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing
 
03:27:57.170 --> 03:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
hb335 relative to notice of tax lien on
 
03:27:58.250 --> 03:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
03:28:00.849 --> 03:28:00.859 align:start position:0%
subject to a lien for old age assistant
 
03:28:02.929 --> 03:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill welcome to
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County Government
 
03:28:07.490 --> 03:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman members
 
03:28:09.290 --> 03:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
of the committee I am representative
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
Michael Cahill of Newmarket I represent
 
03:28:15.769 --> 03:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 the towns of newfields and
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
Newmarket and it's uh nice to be here
 
03:28:20.809 --> 03:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
with you today uh this is this bill
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
we're here because uh in the last term a
 
03:28:26.570 --> 03:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
constituent asked me to file a bill to
 
03:28:29.330 --> 03:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline for the other lanes
 
03:28:31.809 --> 03:28:31.819 align:start position:0%
other liens covered by
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 80 colon 65 which we did this
 
03:28:37.550 --> 03:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
happened in the Judiciary but this year
 
03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
we're in Municipal but that's fine
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
and it sailed through without objection
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
and uh but apparently we missed one and
 
03:28:47.809 --> 03:28:47.819 align:start position:0%
that would be why we're here today to
 
03:28:51.469 --> 03:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
deal with RSA 80 colon 68.
 
03:28:54.410 --> 03:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
and this is the reason is the same in
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
that they are there are only a few
 
03:28:59.030 --> 03:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
people uh doing this sort of work and
 
03:29:00.650 --> 03:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
they need a bit more time so we were
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
asking you to extend the deadline on
 
03:29:05.750 --> 03:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
this particular one by the same 15 days
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
bringing it from 45 to 60. you have
 
03:29:11.929 --> 03:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
testimony from my constituent and I've
 
03:29:15.769 --> 03:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
also brought you the uh the bill from
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
last time and on the reverse side of
 
03:29:20.450 --> 03:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
that is the testimony and support of
 
03:29:22.910 --> 03:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
that bill from the municipal Association
 
03:29:25.250 --> 03:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
and uh perhaps explaining it more
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
thoroughly than I can the reason why
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
I see no questions representative Cahill
 
03:29:47.630 --> 03:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
very well uh I'm not going to push them
 
03:29:50.150 --> 03:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
out or anything I have no further pink
 
03:29:50.160 --> 03:29:53.870 align:start position:0%
out or anything I have no further pink
cards

03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet I have two individuals
 
03:29:59.450 --> 03:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HP 335 thank you
 
03:30:03.120 --> 03:30:26.750 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HP 335 thank you
sir

03:30:26.750 --> 03:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay we have 10 minutes until we begin
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.469 --> 03:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
Okay one minute warning folks
 
03:42:02.929 --> 03:42:02.939 align:start position:0%
before we get going uh I'm going to ask
 
03:42:05.870 --> 03:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
the anybody who's intending to testify
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
please limit your testimony to three
 
03:42:10.910 --> 03:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
minutes we have a lot of cards on this
 
03:42:10.920 --> 03:42:12.170 align:start position:0%
minutes we have a lot of cards on this
bill

03:42:12.170 --> 03:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:42:14.330 --> 03:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
if somebody before you makes the point
 
03:42:16.849 --> 03:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
please do not reiterate it
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
and other than that we will go ahead and
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on House Bill 423
 
03:42:25.849 --> 03:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
relative to accessory dwelling unit uses
 
03:42:29.450 --> 03:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
Allowed by right representative Reed
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
welcome back thank you Mr chair and
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
03:42:35.570 --> 03:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
committee once again for my for the
 
03:42:37.190 --> 03:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ellen Reed and I
 
03:42:39.050 --> 03:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 that's New
 
03:42:41.389 --> 03:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
Market in new fields and I do hope the
 
03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
chair will be kind with me about any
 
03:42:44.630 --> 03:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
three-minute limit because I'm
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill
 
03:42:48.530 --> 03:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you all obviously know what accessory
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
dwelling units are a few years back and
 
03:42:52.969 --> 03:42:52.979 align:start position:0%
I do believe it was a republican
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
sponsored Bill uh a bill passed and
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
became law saying that we have one Adu
 
03:43:01.490 --> 03:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
little kind of in-law apartment buy
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
right for every homeowner
 
03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
right for every homeowner
um

03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
my constituent reached out to me a few
 
03:43:11.570 --> 03:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
years ago he was attempting to build an
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
in-law unit in his detached garage
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
completely contained within the detached
 
03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:19.979 align:start position:0%
garage the law had allowed towns to
 
03:43:19.979 --> 03:43:21.130 align:start position:0%
garage the law had allowed towns to
limit

03:43:21.130 --> 03:43:21.140 align:start position:0%
limit
 
03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
the Adu that was allowed by Wright to
 
03:43:26.990 --> 03:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
being only attached and my town had done
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
so and interpreted that word attached to
 
03:43:31.790 --> 03:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
mean it had to actually be attached to
 
03:43:35.090 --> 03:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
the primary building and not contained
 
03:43:36.410 --> 03:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
within any other pre-existing building
 
03:43:38.210 --> 03:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
even though those buildings had already
 
03:43:40.250 --> 03:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
gotten approved by the town their
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
Footprints were there you're not adding
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
to the footprint and my constituent
 
03:43:46.250 --> 03:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
rightfully pointed out to me
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
um and everybody actually that in a
 
03:43:50.030 --> 03:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and this was several
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
years ago when the housing crisis was
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
nowhere near as severe as it is now that
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
we should not be limiting
 
03:43:58.729 --> 03:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
homeowners from creating what is in
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
essence affordable yet very frequently
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
high quality housing so rather than
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
being in a kind of large builder-grade
 
03:44:11.150 --> 03:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
low-income apartment building like we
 
03:44:13.250 --> 03:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
frequently talk about people building
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
this allows people to build onto their
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
own uh houses and those tend to be when
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
they're building on their own homes tend
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
to be higher quality and they maintain
 
03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
them better and usually those people are
 
03:44:26.330 --> 03:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
people who have a normal job and they're
 
03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
just working so why are we preventing
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
this kind of decentralized uh kind of
 
03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
victory garden approach to increasing
 
03:44:38.809 --> 03:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
affordable but high quality Supply that
 
03:44:42.290 --> 03:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
we desperately need so I went to my town
 
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
planner at the time who's no longer my
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
town planner and I may have said this in
 
03:44:48.290 --> 03:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony ball repeated
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
when I when I told her I didn't like the
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we were prohibiting this
 
03:44:53.929 --> 03:44:53.939 align:start position:0%
because this helps homeowners and it
 
03:44:55.729 --> 03:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
helps tenants and it's really one of
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
those rare moments that actually does
 
03:44:57.239 --> 03:44:58.429 align:start position:0%
those rare moments that actually does
that

03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
um she told me those people meaning
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
people who needed low-income housing
 
03:45:03.769 --> 03:45:03.779 align:start position:0%
those people we do enough for those
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
people they have the trailers and the
 
03:45:05.279 --> 03:45:06.590 align:start position:0%
people they have the trailers and the
apartments

03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
I told her that I was indeed one of
 
03:45:11.330 --> 03:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
those people
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
um the other thing about adus is that
 
03:45:16.610 --> 03:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
you can create adus and not impact rural
 
03:45:18.889 --> 03:45:18.899 align:start position:0%
character certainly my constituent
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
putting an Adu inside of a completely
 
03:45:24.590 --> 03:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
detached structure would not have been
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
obvious to anybody passing on the street
 
03:45:30.050 --> 03:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
that that was occupied by somebody you
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't know it just looks like a house
 
03:45:34.250 --> 03:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
with a garage on some land very lovely
 
03:45:35.809 --> 03:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
rural character that we talk about
 
03:45:35.819 --> 03:45:40.070 align:start position:0%
rural character that we talk about
preserving

03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:42.830 --> 03:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I do serve on the special housing
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee and one of the things that has
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
already become very apparent on that
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
committee is that the area that onerous
 
03:45:53.690 --> 03:45:53.700 align:start position:0%
Town restrictions that prevents
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
Solutions such as this
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
um they went after even I think things
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
that towns would have a harder time
 
03:46:04.729 --> 03:46:04.739 align:start position:0%
swallowing like lot minimums and what
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
have you but this is a really easy thing
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is simply extending uh the right we
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
have to 180u to two adus and it does a
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
couple other things too I did work with
 
03:46:17.150 --> 03:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
two different town planners the town
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
planner of my town of Newmarket as well
 
03:46:20.630 --> 03:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
as an adjoining town in a different
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
County Durham to draft this language
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I also worked with the municipal
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
Association to draft the language which
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
was the real hard get as you can imagine
 
03:46:35.090 --> 03:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
um so just to go through the bones of
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
the bill this does expand by right to
 
03:46:41.750 --> 03:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
two adus it does redefine what attach
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
means to include not just sharing a part
 
03:46:47.030 --> 03:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
of a wall with the primary resonance but
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
also completely contained within a
 
03:46:51.530 --> 03:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
pre-existing pre-approved structure
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
that's detached from the primary
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
structure so again if the town's already
 
03:46:56.690 --> 03:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
approved that footprint there's no
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
reason the town should be limiting
 
03:47:01.250 --> 03:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
people from having an apartment in that
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
in that structure
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
it uh it does remove the re the the
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
ability for the town to require on one
 
03:47:10.800 --> 03:47:11.809 align:start position:0%
ability for the town to require on one
unit

03:47:11.809 --> 03:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh that it be attached so if a person
 
03:47:16.969 --> 03:47:16.979 align:start position:0%
chooses to have one Adu it may be
 
03:47:19.610 --> 03:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
attached or detached but if it does
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
allow the town to require one unit be
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
attached if that person then has another
 
03:47:24.359 --> 03:47:25.309 align:start position:0%
attached if that person then has another
unit

03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
unit
 
03:47:28.190 --> 03:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I may end up saying second unit it
 
03:47:30.229 --> 03:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
just understand second unit doesn't mean
 
03:47:32.330 --> 03:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
chronologically the second unit it's not
 
03:47:34.010 --> 03:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
the second unit being built
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
chronologically it means if a person has
 
03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
two units one is allowed something and
 
03:47:40.190 --> 03:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
the other one is allowed to be
 
03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:41.690 align:start position:0%
the other one is allowed to be
restricted

03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
03:47:45.469 --> 03:47:45.479 align:start position:0%
it increases the existing square footage
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
the the amount that a town can restrict
 
03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
the square footage of an Adu down to so
 
03:47:53.809 --> 03:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
right now a town can restrict an huge um
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
to no no less no less than 750 square
 
03:48:00.349 --> 03:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
feet this raises that up to a thousand
 
03:48:02.269 --> 03:48:02.279 align:start position:0%
the reason that's important is because
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
what we're attempting to do is create
 
03:48:07.389 --> 03:48:07.399 align:start position:0%
supply of long-term sustainable housing
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
and you can't do that
 
03:48:12.769 --> 03:48:12.779 align:start position:0%
um for you know with just small
 
03:48:15.290 --> 03:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
apartments around a thousand square feet
 
03:48:17.330 --> 03:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
is when you can kind of have a small
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
family or a couple with a dog if you're
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
only restricting to 750 square feet that
 
03:48:25.550 --> 03:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
means you're basically limited to like
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
college kids or single people for as
 
03:48:29.990 --> 03:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
long as they're single you're looking at
 
03:48:32.090 --> 03:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
more short-term tenants that are only
 
03:48:33.290 --> 03:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
going to stay there for a year or two
 
03:48:35.690 --> 03:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
years rather than that longer term
 
03:48:37.490 --> 03:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
investment in that community that we're
 
03:48:39.769 --> 03:48:39.779 align:start position:0%
we're looking to achieve
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
it it brings that up to a thousand
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
square feet for one unit any other unit
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
may be restricted down to 850 square
 
03:48:47.399 --> 03:48:48.410 align:start position:0%
may be restricted down to 850 square
feet

03:48:48.410 --> 03:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
feet
 
03:48:50.269 --> 03:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
in the current existing long and I want
 
03:48:52.370 --> 03:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
I want to be very very clear nothing in
 
03:48:53.330 --> 03:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:48:56.809 --> 03:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh touches restricts the one Adu we have
 
03:48:58.729 --> 03:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
by right I was very adamant that we had
 
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
to leave every right that we have in
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
place for that first Adu in place if
 
03:49:05.809 --> 03:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
there is an additional Adu that this is
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
creating the right for there are a few
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
things that the town can restrict for
 
03:49:13.010 --> 03:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
the additional Adu but not the first Adu
 
03:49:14.030 --> 03:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's been allowed by right again
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's not chronological it's the number
 
03:49:18.830 --> 03:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
of Adas you have so for any additional
 
03:49:21.050 --> 03:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
it's 850 square feet that a town May
 
03:49:23.690 --> 03:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
restrict the size down to if you have
 
03:49:25.969 --> 03:49:25.979 align:start position:0%
more than one Adu these Town may require
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
that you have a lot minimum of no more
 
03:49:30.910 --> 03:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
than a half of an acre
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
and uh towns can uh the I already
 
03:49:37.429 --> 03:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
covered the attached piece so they can't
 
03:49:39.469 --> 03:49:39.479 align:start position:0%
require that one be attached but they
 
03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
can require if you have an additional
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
one that that be attached and then the
 
03:49:44.269 --> 03:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
last piece in the piece that I will say
 
03:49:45.769 --> 03:49:45.779 align:start position:0%
that the municipal Association was
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
particularly fond of if someone Builds
 
03:49:52.370 --> 03:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
an additional Adu then the town can
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
tell that uh just like they would with
 
03:49:57.170 --> 03:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
say like a an apartment building project
 
03:49:59.929 --> 03:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
they can say that one has to meet our
 
03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing formula and thereby
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
allow the towns to count that unit
 
03:50:06.530 --> 03:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
towards their Workforce housing
 
03:50:09.769 --> 03:50:09.779 align:start position:0%
requirement so that's kind of the bones
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the entire bill
 
03:50:15.530 --> 03:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
but I just to Circle back around to the
 
03:50:17.830 --> 03:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
importance of adus not only is it this
 
03:50:20.330 --> 03:50:20.340 align:start position:0%
decentralized kind of victory card and
 
03:50:22.370 --> 03:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
approach to creating Supply that ends up
 
03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
being way uh
 
03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
way better for land landowners because
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
it helps them buy or stay in their homes
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm the ideal the gold standard
 
03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
would be home ownership we want people
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to own homes because that
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
home ownership rates increased
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
homeownership rates uh improve basically
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
every metric of a town if you can have a
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
little apartment off to the side you can
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
get that rental income and afford to buy
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
a home and that's what towns ideally
 
03:50:52.510 --> 03:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
would like
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
but also so it helps people stay in
 
03:50:56.269 --> 03:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
their homes helps people buy homes but
 
03:50:59.389 --> 03:50:59.399 align:start position:0%
it really creates a really healthy much
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
healthier environment on average than
 
03:51:04.969 --> 03:51:04.979 align:start position:0%
large Builder grade apartment complexes
 
03:51:07.190 --> 03:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
as someone who's lived in apartments my
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
entire life I can tell you I know that
 
03:51:10.969 --> 03:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
there's people who don't want apartment
 
03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
complexes in their neighborhood I think
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
we do need to address density for sure
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you A lot of those places
 
03:51:20.570 --> 03:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
aren't a blast to live in either for
 
03:51:22.010 --> 03:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
most people you would rather live in
 
03:51:24.110 --> 03:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
someone's Adu because it's not kind of a
 
03:51:25.969 --> 03:51:25.979 align:start position:0%
corporate landlord it's just a you know
 
03:51:28.010 --> 03:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
a person with the job and you can use
 
03:51:30.290 --> 03:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
their backyard and maybe negotiate that
 
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
you can have a dog or you know a garden
 
03:51:35.210 --> 03:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
or whatever it just and fosters that
 
03:51:37.130 --> 03:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
personal relationship in that community
 
03:51:40.849 --> 03:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
and helps people be happier for longer
 
03:51:40.859 --> 03:51:41.450 align:start position:0%
and helps people be happier for longer
um

03:51:41.450 --> 03:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:45.950 --> 03:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative priest
 
03:51:51.469 --> 03:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just for
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you for taking my
 
03:51:55.490 --> 03:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
question of course representative
 
03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
um so let's pretend that we have a
 
03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
existing structure and under the current
 
03:52:05.690 --> 03:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
Adu law they
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
divided their house into two units
 
03:52:12.110 --> 03:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
and one was being the Adu right under
 
03:52:14.809 --> 03:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
this law would they be able to build
 
03:52:18.769 --> 03:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
another unit detached on their property
 
03:52:22.550 --> 03:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
so there would be three units correct
 
03:52:26.030 --> 03:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
okay so yes so um because in your
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
example you described a situation where
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
that current unit that they already had
 
03:52:34.250 --> 03:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
was already attached
 
03:52:37.309 --> 03:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
um this bill allows at least one of the
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
units to be detached and so they would
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
be allowed to have a detached unit
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
whether completely contained within well
 
03:52:46.610 --> 03:52:46.620 align:start position:0%
that counts as attached to but they
 
03:52:48.050 --> 03:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
could be contained within a detached
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
garage or built entirely separately
 
03:52:51.720 --> 03:52:53.990 align:start position:0%
garage or built entirely separately
yeah

03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.849 --> 03:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
03:52:59.450 --> 03:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
um so uh I let's suppose I didn't have I
 
03:53:03.170 --> 03:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
have a lot a house on say one acre lot I
 
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
didn't have the fourth saw forethought
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
or lock to have a detached garage uh
 
03:53:11.690 --> 03:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
currently by right I'm only allowed to
 
03:53:14.690 --> 03:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
do an attached Adu I would not be able
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
to do a a a detached Adu by right so my
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
question is why not just allow in this
 
03:53:26.210 --> 03:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
bill a detached Adu to be allowed by
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
right it is
 
03:53:31.630 --> 03:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
and if if it's not let me um sorry
 
03:53:34.729 --> 03:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
question follow-up so in other words I
 
03:53:36.889 --> 03:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
don't it appears under here that in
 
03:53:40.250 --> 03:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
order to have the detached Adu I have to
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
have a pre-existing structure so that
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
counts no that counts as attached now
 
03:53:48.590 --> 03:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
so previously completely contained
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
within a detached structure counted
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
apparently for most towns interpretation
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
as detached I am saying that that counts
 
03:53:58.670 --> 03:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
as attached and in addition you are
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
allowed by right one detached unit
 
03:54:05.150 --> 03:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
which would be a standalone unit
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
the questions representative majority
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:54:11.690 --> 03:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question we have a bill in
 
03:54:13.729 --> 03:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
this committee House Bill 44 which is
 
03:54:15.530 --> 03:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
the four Plex bill
 
03:54:19.969 --> 03:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
if that bill were to pass could we have
 
03:54:23.809 --> 03:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
could each one of those have an two ad
 
03:54:23.819 --> 03:54:25.010 align:start position:0%
could each one of those have an two ad
use

03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:54:27.290 --> 03:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
no I do not believe that's the case
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
because first of all the bills are
 
03:54:32.090 --> 03:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
substantively different in that that
 
03:54:34.490 --> 03:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
bill only impacts Municipal City and
 
03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
water this is for everyone and and
 
03:54:38.450 --> 03:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
obviously the more you get out of
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
Municipal and City Water you have larger
 
03:54:42.490 --> 03:54:42.500 align:start position:0%
Lots anyway
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that ability to
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
have a four Plex in one lot that that
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
would still count toward that this would
 
03:54:54.650 --> 03:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
be counted as that so it would increase
 
03:54:57.229 --> 03:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
that to four on those Municipal and City
 
03:54:59.090 --> 03:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
Water Lots
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
um instead of like three essentially is
 
03:55:03.110 --> 03:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here but that those
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
would essentially be counted as that if
 
03:55:07.370 --> 03:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
um if there's a different interpretation
 
03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
of law we can certainly address that in
 
03:55:11.929 --> 03:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
or the questions representative Kelly
 
03:55:18.170 --> 03:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you so my understanding of your
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
explanation was that adus the difference
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
between Adu and a separate unit kind of
 
03:55:26.929 --> 03:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
like a duplex versus the Adu is
 
03:55:31.010 --> 03:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
essentially the same and so you so if
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have a duplex and an Adu then you're
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
technically have three a kind of a three
 
03:55:40.969 --> 03:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
Plex is that your interpretation
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
so that the ID so adus are kind of
 
03:55:46.610 --> 03:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
subordinate whereas duplexes and and
 
03:55:48.410 --> 03:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
cottages and all of that are kind of
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
Standalone the Standalone is kind of
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
bigger and more onerous than an Adu and
 
03:55:56.389 --> 03:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
so if you're building one of those it's
 
03:55:59.210 --> 03:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
as if you've built an Adu plus right
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
kind of in a way to think about it so if
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
you're the threshold for building an Adu
 
03:56:07.969 --> 03:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
is lower so if you've jumped that up to
 
03:56:10.969 --> 03:56:10.979 align:start position:0%
you know a separate unit entirely like a
 
03:56:13.250 --> 03:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
cottage or whatever then it's not that
 
03:56:15.050 --> 03:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
each one of those gets their own the
 
03:56:16.969 --> 03:56:16.979 align:start position:0%
other piece of that is that on a lot of
 
03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
the municipal City and water lots that
 
03:56:23.349 --> 03:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
are being discussed in that other Bill
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
those lots will be under the half acre
 
03:56:31.010 --> 03:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
that towns are allowed to require in
 
03:56:34.189 --> 03:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
this bill so they towns could say no
 
03:56:37.910 --> 03:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
your lot is too small to allow an Adu
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
brother further questions
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative 11.
 
03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks uh
 
03:56:46.250 --> 03:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for coming to
 
03:56:46.260 --> 03:56:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for coming to
testify

03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm all about the Adu I got to tell you
 
03:56:52.010 --> 03:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to sound weird can an Adu be
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
attached to an Adu
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's a lot were you
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
not done I will expand and just yeah go
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
ahead so I have a single family home
 
03:57:08.090 --> 03:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
I build an Adu that's not attached
 
03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I want to build another Adu can I
 
03:57:11.809 --> 03:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
attach it to my Adu or do I have to
 
03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
attach it to my house
 
03:57:13.319 --> 03:57:15.229 align:start position:0%
attach it to my house
so

03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
it has to be oh I see so are you
 
03:57:19.490 --> 03:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
building like to
 
03:57:21.290 --> 03:57:21.300 align:start position:0%
um that would so that the town in that
 
03:57:23.990 --> 03:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
case would be allowed to require that it
 
03:57:27.769 --> 03:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
be attached to your primary dwelling the
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
second one in this bill again happy to
 
03:57:32.929 --> 03:57:32.939 align:start position:0%
address that I will just say I'm very
 
03:57:34.849 --> 03:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
happy to hear you're all about the adus
 
03:57:37.010 --> 03:57:37.020 align:start position:0%
because one of the things I forgot to
 
03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
mention was that they really are life
 
03:57:42.530 --> 03:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
cycle housing because as an adult you
 
03:57:44.510 --> 03:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
buy a house you decide in order to buy a
 
03:57:45.950 --> 03:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
house the only way you can afford is to
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
build an Adu so you build an Adu maybe
 
03:57:49.969 --> 03:57:49.979 align:start position:0%
you rent it out to or first you might
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
build it just for your elderly parent
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
but then when your elderly elderly
 
03:57:55.729 --> 03:57:55.739 align:start position:0%
parent moves on you might rent it out to
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
a college student then when your kids
 
03:57:58.969 --> 03:57:58.979 align:start position:0%
are old enough for college they might
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
rent it then you might move into your
 
03:58:03.170 --> 03:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
own you answered the question a long
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
time ago representative mangaputi
 
03:58:07.010 --> 03:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
lifecycle housing
 
03:58:10.010 --> 03:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the question is for you I'm one
 
03:58:11.870 --> 03:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
of the co-sponsors am I allowed to ask
 
03:58:14.809 --> 03:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
questions I'm not testifying so is I
 
03:58:16.969 --> 03:58:16.979 align:start position:0%
know it's either or you may ask
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
questions as long as you are not
 
03:58:21.170 --> 03:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
testifying thank you
 
03:58:23.689 --> 03:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for bringing this uh
 
03:58:26.640 --> 03:58:27.710 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for bringing this uh
bill

03:58:27.710 --> 03:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:58:29.630 --> 03:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
03:58:34.809 --> 03:58:34.819 align:start position:0%
how would this enhance the co-op
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity in terms of co-owning a
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
property so you know
 
03:58:43.490 --> 03:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
how would that enhance a building
 
03:58:46.130 --> 03:58:46.140 align:start position:0%
density as well as improving
 
03:58:48.530 --> 03:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
so I don't think you thank you for the
 
03:58:51.590 --> 03:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
question I don't see it legally like
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
addressing Co-op issues but socially
 
03:58:57.229 --> 03:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
speaking it provides more opportunities
 
03:58:59.210 --> 03:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
because if you have two adus on a
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
property now you've got two tenants
 
03:59:03.410 --> 03:59:03.420 align:start position:0%
maybe the the original owner wants to
 
03:59:05.330 --> 03:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
sell now you've got two tenants they're
 
03:59:07.790 --> 03:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
able to split the cost of buying that
 
03:59:10.610 --> 03:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
property together so and then maybe they
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
get a third person for the main unit or
 
03:59:14.450 --> 03:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
you know somehow work that out whereas
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
if you only have one Adu it's either
 
03:59:18.050 --> 03:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
that person can buy your entire property
 
03:59:20.090 --> 03:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
or they can't
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative ukella
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you you were talking about
 
03:59:26.809 --> 03:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
um kind of like Aging in place
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
essentially as far as like your your
 
03:59:32.269 --> 03:59:32.279 align:start position:0%
situation changing can you expand it
 
03:59:34.370 --> 03:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
more upon that thank you so much for the
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
question so as I was saying as you might
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
decide that you need to build an Adu for
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
your aging parent when they move on you
 
03:59:43.370 --> 03:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
might rent it out for your college
 
03:59:45.769 --> 03:59:45.779 align:start position:0%
student then when your kids become old
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
enough maybe transitionally in between
 
03:59:51.290 --> 03:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
moving out they rent your unit then they
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
move out you may decide as you're aging
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
you move into your own Adu for a smaller
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
space rent out for you know after you're
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
retired you have less income rent out
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
the main unit instead of renting out the
 
04:00:05.689 --> 04:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
Adu and it just kind of goes like that
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's it it it really plays
 
04:00:11.450 --> 04:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
into our natural life cycle to have kind
 
04:00:14.210 --> 04:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
of an accessory unit
 
04:00:19.610 --> 04:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:22.490 --> 04:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
if you were a child of us of the 60s
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
would you call that a commune
 
04:00:28.490 --> 04:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
so no
 
04:00:28.500 --> 04:00:29.210 align:start position:0%
so no
um

04:00:29.210 --> 04:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:31.670 --> 04:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm a child of children of the 60s
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
so any further questions you answered
 
04:00:37.370 --> 04:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
the question you said no representative
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:00:40.729 --> 04:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
um and thanks for the moment of levity
 
04:00:45.050 --> 04:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
are you aware of how many towns have
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
enacted a clear Adu ordinance in their
 
04:00:51.889 --> 04:00:51.899 align:start position:0%
town since the original Adu law was
 
04:00:55.670 --> 04:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
passed I ask because I discovered that
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
my town of Dover has a very unclear Adu
 
04:01:01.849 --> 04:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
and basically the only way you can get
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
one is getting a variance and it's
 
04:01:07.969 --> 04:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
annoying which uh thank you for the
 
04:01:07.979 --> 04:01:09.189 align:start position:0%
annoying which uh thank you for the
question

04:01:09.189 --> 04:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
comment and uh I was not aware that it
 
04:01:14.570 --> 04:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
sounds like from just your description
 
04:01:16.250 --> 04:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
Dover may not be doing it right because
 
04:01:19.010 --> 04:01:19.020 align:start position:0%
they are guaranteed by right
 
04:01:21.650 --> 04:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
um but anyhow other towns is really what
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
I'm interested so I don't know about
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
other towns I know about my town and
 
04:01:27.290 --> 04:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
that my town chose to take the state up
 
04:01:29.630 --> 04:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
on limiting to only attached and that
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
they've determined that for them
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
attachment not including completely
 
04:01:35.689 --> 04:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
contained within a pre-existing
 
04:01:37.969 --> 04:01:37.979 align:start position:0%
structure thank you further questions so
 
04:01:37.979 --> 04:01:39.710 align:start position:0%
structure thank you further questions so
representative

04:01:39.710 --> 04:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:01:46.070 --> 04:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
um with regard to adus is there anything
 
04:01:49.550 --> 04:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
in statute that restricts or limits the
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
the the occupants to be
 
04:01:54.170 --> 04:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
um family related
 
04:01:54.180 --> 04:01:55.490 align:start position:0%
um family related
currently

04:01:55.490 --> 04:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:01:58.670 --> 04:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh no in fact
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
04:02:03.889 --> 04:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
if I and this is a while ago since I
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
worked with OLS on this but there was
 
04:02:05.760 --> 04:02:07.130 align:start position:0%
worked with OLS on this but there was
some

04:02:07.130 --> 04:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
um reference to
 
04:02:13.010 --> 04:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
like family but it's not restricting it
 
04:02:17.630 --> 04:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Gilman
 
04:02:23.090 --> 04:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the source of the um
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
square footage that's adequate for uh
 
04:02:33.889 --> 04:02:33.899 align:start position:0%
size of demographics that you're looking
 
04:02:38.090 --> 04:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
to fit it was a compromise between me
 
04:02:40.130 --> 04:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
and the town planners and especially the
 
04:02:43.849 --> 04:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
town planner Durham thank you
 
04:02:46.370 --> 04:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Davis
 
04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
04:02:52.490 --> 04:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
and my apologies if this has been asked
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
and answered before
 
04:02:58.250 --> 04:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
but since this is not a bill dealing
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
with areas that are served by public
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
water and sewer
 
04:03:05.450 --> 04:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
presumably so if it passes some of these
 
04:03:09.650 --> 04:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
adus will be in areas served by septic
 
04:03:14.570 --> 04:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
what if the septic is inadequate to
 
04:03:17.450 --> 04:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
serve the additional adus thank you so
 
04:03:19.010 --> 04:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
much for the question that is actually
 
04:03:21.530 --> 04:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
addressed in in the existing RSA which I
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
did not change so the only way a town is
 
04:03:27.889 --> 04:03:27.899 align:start position:0%
allowed to deny an attached Adu under
 
04:03:31.250 --> 04:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
750 square feet at this moment is if it
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh the the existing water and
 
04:03:36.530 --> 04:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
septic is not up to what is necessary
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
for those that number of bedrooms so the
 
04:03:42.110 --> 04:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
person would have to improve their water
 
04:03:44.210 --> 04:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
and septic in order to build that's
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
currently the case for adus and we did
 
04:03:49.309 --> 04:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
not change that so if you're building
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
additional Adu your water and septic
 
04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
still need to to meet the requirement
 
04:03:57.469 --> 04:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
04:03:59.150 --> 04:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:04:01.130 --> 04:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
taking a second question
 
04:04:03.410 --> 04:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
um in uh I guess it's line 26 number
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
three there is a change to existing law
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
with the interior door went from a shell
 
04:04:10.490 --> 04:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
to a may I know you I know you said this
 
04:04:15.229 --> 04:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
but I'm not 100 clear on why that is now
 
04:04:18.170 --> 04:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
optional that was another request of the
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
Town planners they they themselves did
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
not think that in that requiring an
 
04:04:27.650 --> 04:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
interior door was necessary adus have
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
their own separate entrances so thank
 
04:04:31.620 --> 04:04:34.689 align:start position:0%
their own separate entrances so thank
you

04:04:34.689 --> 04:04:34.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you so much
 
04:04:50.269 --> 04:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:52.370 --> 04:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
hi so
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah most most of you should know me
 
04:05:00.290 --> 04:05:00.300 align:start position:0%
as representative Eric Gallagher um so I
 
04:05:00.300 --> 04:05:01.010 align:start position:0%
as representative Eric Gallagher um so I
um

04:05:01.010 --> 04:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:04.150 --> 04:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
I'm doing the opposite of Representative
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
mangaputi where I'm testifying instead
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
of asking questions
 
04:05:12.290 --> 04:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I think representative Reed did a
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
pretty good job covering the legal
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
aspects of the text of the bill so I
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
just kind of want to add a personal
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
story here
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'm currently in a long distance
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
relationship my fiance and I met online
 
04:05:30.479 --> 04:05:33.110 align:start position:0%
relationship my fiance and I met online
and

04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
um she lives in New Jersey I live here
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire and one of the
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
reasons we haven't been able to
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
move in together is just because
 
04:05:44.570 --> 04:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
housing is so hard to find
 
04:05:44.580 --> 04:05:48.410 align:start position:0%
housing is so hard to find
so

04:05:48.410 --> 04:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
um her her dream
 
04:05:50.880 --> 04:05:52.189 align:start position:0%
um her her dream
for

04:05:52.189 --> 04:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
dream house has always been to have
 
04:05:55.500 --> 04:05:56.090 align:start position:0%
dream house has always been to have
um

04:05:56.090 --> 04:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
a property with separate dwellings on it
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
for each of her close closest family
 
04:06:06.110 --> 04:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
members in other words 80 years so and
 
04:06:06.120 --> 04:06:07.910 align:start position:0%
members in other words 80 years so and
in

04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:06:09.530 --> 04:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
New Jersey
 
04:06:13.070 --> 04:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're actually they don't even have an
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
Adu law
 
04:06:15.359 --> 04:06:16.309 align:start position:0%
Adu law
um

04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
so they don't allow any adus by right
 
04:06:23.210 --> 04:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:06:25.490 --> 04:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think
 
04:06:27.050 --> 04:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
I think passing this here in New
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire she she still probably want to
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
live in New Jersey anyways since that's
 
04:06:35.689 --> 04:06:35.699 align:start position:0%
closer to where her family is
 
04:06:35.699 --> 04:06:36.229 align:start position:0%
closer to where her family is
um

04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:40.250 --> 04:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
but I I do think so yeah this wouldn't
 
04:06:42.650 --> 04:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
directly benefit us
 
04:06:45.170 --> 04:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
um but I think it could at least Inspire
 
04:06:47.809 --> 04:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
other states we have to be thinking
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
about how we're not the only state with
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis here and we have an
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show leadership us to
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
what is possible
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
with pro-housing legislation for other
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
states that are also experiencing their
 
04:07:09.410 --> 04:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
own housing crisis is
 
04:07:13.370 --> 04:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I think that is an important
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
reason to support this bill
 
04:07:19.849 --> 04:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.859 --> 04:07:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:07:22.250 --> 04:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for testifying um it
 
04:07:29.330 --> 04:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that your your story was
 
04:07:32.809 --> 04:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
essentially saying that you would
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
um be able to like if this passed that
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
it would be essentially an attractive
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
benefit of New Hampshire that might
 
04:07:42.610 --> 04:07:42.620 align:start position:0%
encourage people
 
04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
maybe your significant other maybe
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
others to move to New Hampshire because
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
of the way that they want to
 
04:07:52.250 --> 04:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
um you know age in place
 
04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah it'd be a factor to consider
 
04:07:59.030 --> 04:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
um a you know different different
 
04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
families could wait different
 
04:08:04.910 --> 04:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
um factors
 
04:08:07.130 --> 04:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
um different amounts so
 
04:08:09.889 --> 04:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
um while in my particular case the
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
wanting to be the close to family might
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
um overpower there might be other cases
 
04:08:18.170 --> 04:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
where that wouldn't necessarily be the
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
case and they would want to move here
 
04:08:25.090 --> 04:08:25.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.769 --> 04:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
representative man chapudi thank you Mr
 
04:08:30.110 --> 04:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh representative
 
04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
Gallagher for taking my question
 
04:08:33.060 --> 04:08:34.370 align:start position:0%
Gallagher for taking my question
um

04:08:34.370 --> 04:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
would you consider this would be a
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
benefit in terms of intergenerational
 
04:08:44.030 --> 04:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
living opportunities so Aging in place
 
04:08:48.050 --> 04:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.610 --> 04:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
um yeah definitely
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think
 
04:08:56.090 --> 04:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
having a separate space for
 
04:08:57.969 --> 04:08:57.979 align:start position:0%
different generations
 
04:09:02.050 --> 04:09:02.060 align:start position:0%
of uh think of a single family can be
 
04:09:05.809 --> 04:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
pretty important especially when say the
 
04:09:09.170 --> 04:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
children are adults and the parents are
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
older like when I when I moved back to
 
04:09:13.729 --> 04:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:09:13.739 --> 04:09:14.570 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

04:09:14.570 --> 04:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I I first moved back in with my
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
parents and
 
04:09:22.490 --> 04:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
um there were a lot of
 
04:09:26.570 --> 04:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
um conflicts between between us at just
 
04:09:29.150 --> 04:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
having to share the same living space
 
04:09:32.570 --> 04:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
again so I think yeah being able to
 
04:09:32.580 --> 04:09:33.170 align:start position:0%
again so I think yeah being able to
um

04:09:33.170 --> 04:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:37.150 --> 04:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
have separate Living Spaces could help
 
04:09:37.160 --> 04:09:38.689 align:start position:0%
have separate Living Spaces could help
resolve

04:09:38.689 --> 04:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
04:09:41.750 --> 04:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
help families live more harmoniously
 
04:09:41.760 --> 04:09:44.689 align:start position:0%
help families live more harmoniously
together

04:09:44.689 --> 04:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony next we're going
 
04:10:03.969 --> 04:10:03.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
there we go thank you Mr chair and
 
04:10:08.450 --> 04:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate the opportunity
 
04:10:11.450 --> 04:10:11.460 align:start position:0%
my name is Sarah Holland and I am a
 
04:10:13.010 --> 04:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
realtor and I'm the vice chair of the
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
public policy committee for the New
 
04:10:16.130 --> 04:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors and
 
04:10:17.570 --> 04:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
I'm there
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
um I am here on their behalf as well as
 
04:10:22.010 --> 04:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
my own I absolutely love this bill
 
04:10:22.020 --> 04:10:23.570 align:start position:0%
my own I absolutely love this bill
so

04:10:23.570 --> 04:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:26.450 --> 04:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire housing crisis is real
 
04:10:28.150 --> 04:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
we all know that I'm not going to
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
belabor the stats there
 
04:10:32.990 --> 04:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and I love the term life cycle
 
04:10:37.250 --> 04:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
housing because really that brings us to
 
04:10:39.170 --> 04:10:39.180 align:start position:0%
the stories the real life stories of
 
04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
people that we know and we love and the
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
plights that they have of finding
 
04:10:46.429 --> 04:10:46.439 align:start position:0%
housing in the event of well my my son
 
04:10:48.110 --> 04:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
is 21 when he's done with college
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
housing where does he go does he come
 
04:10:51.650 --> 04:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
home with me probably not a great idea
 
04:10:54.110 --> 04:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
but where is he going to go
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
um in the case of my parents who are
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
aging maybe it makes sense for them to
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
move closer to me or in with me or for
 
04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
folks who happen to have
 
04:11:09.290 --> 04:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
um a relationship that falls apart where
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
does one of those parties go all of
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
these are contributing to the housing
 
04:11:15.769 --> 04:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
crisis that we have in New Hampshire and
 
04:11:17.929 --> 04:11:17.939 align:start position:0%
we seem to be taking the existing
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
inventory that we have now and moving
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
around those those tortoise shells and
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't solve our problem it just
 
04:11:27.170 --> 04:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
shifts everything it looks like maybe
 
04:11:29.210 --> 04:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
we're doing something but we're not
 
04:11:29.220 --> 04:11:30.290 align:start position:0%
we're doing something but we're not
exactly

04:11:30.290 --> 04:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
04:11:31.849 --> 04:11:31.859 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
04:11:31.859 --> 04:11:33.170 align:start position:0%
so this bill
um

04:11:33.170 --> 04:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:36.170 --> 04:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
creates inventory it creates more
 
04:11:38.809 --> 04:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
inventory and it provides Clarity and
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
additional opportunity from the original
 
04:11:45.110 --> 04:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
Adu bill by allowing
 
04:11:45.120 --> 04:11:46.250 align:start position:0%
Adu bill by allowing
um

04:11:46.250 --> 04:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
additional adus in places that are fully
 
04:11:50.460 --> 04:11:51.969 align:start position:0%
additional adus in places that are fully
contained

04:11:51.969 --> 04:11:51.979 align:start position:0%
contained
 
04:11:56.210 --> 04:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
existing structures so for example my
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
situation I live in a small subdivision
 
04:12:02.750 --> 04:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
about 12 houses they were all built in
 
04:12:05.750 --> 04:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the 80s we're all on one acre lots and
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
all of the houses are exactly the same
 
04:12:09.530 --> 04:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
the only difference half of US have
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
attached garages the other ones they're
 
04:12:14.150 --> 04:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
detached garages the town that I live in
 
04:12:17.150 --> 04:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
in order to have an Adu and a detached
 
04:12:20.450 --> 04:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
garage or a detached structure I need to
 
04:12:24.110 --> 04:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
increase my one acre to five acres and I
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't know how I'm going to be able to
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
do that so this would really solve a
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
problem for me as all of our children
 
04:12:33.290 --> 04:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
are now you know they've been out in the
 
04:12:34.849 --> 04:12:34.859 align:start position:0%
world and they're going to come home for
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
a short time and land for a little bit
 
04:12:38.090 --> 04:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
figure out where their what their next
 
04:12:41.210 --> 04:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
step is in life and I don't want them in
 
04:12:42.729 --> 04:12:42.739 align:start position:0%
my space anymore
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
and also as we're aging and I am looking
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
to maybe downsize putting a smaller unit
 
04:12:52.610 --> 04:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
above my garage for provides an
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to live in a smaller
 
04:12:57.229 --> 04:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
space without living moving from the
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
place that I have called home for so
 
04:13:01.610 --> 04:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
long but allowing my children and maybe
 
04:13:03.889 --> 04:13:03.899 align:start position:0%
their spouse and their children to come
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
home and occupy the additional space
 
04:13:09.889 --> 04:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
that we we currently reside in in
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
addition to that there I have numerous
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
stories and numerous clients and
 
04:13:17.090 --> 04:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
consumer consumers that I talk with on a
 
04:13:19.969 --> 04:13:19.979 align:start position:0%
daily basis that
 
04:13:23.570 --> 04:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
really need some temporary housing in
 
04:13:25.729 --> 04:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
between situations
 
04:13:27.530 --> 04:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
um maybe they just graduated from
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
college they want to stay in their
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
current job they can't yet afford to
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
purchase a home or where they're moving
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
next there's some sort of Gap in time
 
04:13:37.010 --> 04:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
that they need to cover we have family
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
friends whose kids are still residing in
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
their home they want them to move on
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
they can't because there is no place for
 
04:13:46.610 --> 04:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
them to go my apartment over my garage
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
which is not yet built but will be
 
04:13:51.410 --> 04:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
thanks to your passing of this bill
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
um will allow them to come to that safe
 
04:13:55.969 --> 04:13:55.979 align:start position:0%
space as well
 
04:13:57.769 --> 04:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
so I think that there are some really
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
great opportunities with this bill to
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
create the much needed inventory in a
 
04:14:07.610 --> 04:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
very safe space as well
 
04:14:07.620 --> 04:14:08.389 align:start position:0%
very safe space as well
um

04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
and we've seen with the current
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
accessory unit dwelling unit law that
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2016. a lot of the
 
04:14:17.929 --> 04:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised there really
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
have not materialized and we know that
 
04:14:24.469 --> 04:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
local control is super important and
 
04:14:27.110 --> 04:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
everyone takes it seriously however it's
 
04:14:30.110 --> 04:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
important to remember that the state has
 
04:14:32.570 --> 04:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
mandated numerous items on communities
 
04:14:35.330 --> 04:14:35.340 align:start position:0%
besides adus
 
04:14:35.340 --> 04:14:37.990 align:start position:0%
besides adus
yes

04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.170 --> 04:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
well over the oh sorry a lot of time I'm
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
pretty sure we understand where you're
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
going with this anybody have any
 
04:14:48.110 --> 04:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative Gilman thank
 
04:14:49.670 --> 04:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:14:52.210 --> 04:14:52.220 align:start position:0%
question uh I have with this bill
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for being on
 
04:14:58.130 --> 04:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
Municipal and water and sewer so this
 
04:15:00.650 --> 04:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
can expand out from the middle of town
 
04:15:02.990 --> 04:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
so if you have a compact
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh center of town and as you get further
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
out there's more space in rural
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
character do you think that this bill
 
04:15:13.130 --> 04:15:13.140 align:start position:0%
would start to fill in those places and
 
04:15:15.170 --> 04:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
the rural character of a community would
 
04:15:18.950 --> 04:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
would become less desirable
 
04:15:23.090 --> 04:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
I would say I would say no so I actually
 
04:15:24.950 --> 04:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
come from an area of the state where
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
Community sewer and water are fairly
 
04:15:28.439 --> 04:15:29.929 align:start position:0%
Community sewer and water are fairly
non-existent

04:15:29.929 --> 04:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
non-existent
 
04:15:31.610 --> 04:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so this would provide an opportunity
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
we we are all very much part of this
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
housing crisis and folks just want to be
 
04:15:39.469 --> 04:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
in safe living situations
 
04:15:41.870 --> 04:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
um and feel part of a community so if
 
04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
you can do that by adding an additional
 
04:15:46.969 --> 04:15:46.979 align:start position:0%
unit to your existing house or two
 
04:15:48.790 --> 04:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
additional units to your existing house
 
04:15:52.250 --> 04:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
I think that they're um
 
04:15:54.050 --> 04:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
thought there is a huge need for that
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I think that that wouldn't become an
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
issue relative to the sewer and water
 
04:16:00.110 --> 04:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
there is Provisions in here as
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
previously stated by representative
 
04:16:01.680 --> 04:16:03.830 align:start position:0%
previously stated by representative
reach

04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
reach
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
I will ask those testifying to please
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
try to remain on to the question asked
 
04:16:12.769 --> 04:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
please representative majority
 
04:16:14.210 --> 04:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
taking this question we we have a
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we passed a bill to allow
 
04:16:22.729 --> 04:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
an Adu so my question is how did passage
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
of that bill help our housing crisis in
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
so much as how will increasing it from
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
one to two help our housing crisis and I
 
04:16:31.610 --> 04:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a stat on that that's why
 
04:16:32.929 --> 04:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
I'm asking the question yeah absolutely
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
so only from my personal experience and
 
04:16:37.250 --> 04:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
I also do not have a stat relative to
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
that however
 
04:16:42.769 --> 04:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
it didn't help my situation and I'm
 
04:16:44.929 --> 04:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
hoping that this language change will
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
help my situation
 
04:16:51.170 --> 04:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative representative yokella
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know thank you for taking the
 
04:16:56.640 --> 04:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
you know thank you for taking the
question

04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:58.560 --> 04:16:59.389 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:01.849 --> 04:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
under the current law
 
04:17:06.650 --> 04:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
um they defined attached very narrowly
 
04:17:10.370 --> 04:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
to actually being attached with the with
 
04:17:13.010 --> 04:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
the main structure and not
 
04:17:15.769 --> 04:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
um in existing structures that you
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
already inhabit and
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
um can you talk a little bit about how
 
04:17:24.290 --> 04:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
maybe that might not be appropriate for
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
every situation and and how existing
 
04:17:32.030 --> 04:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
um transforming an existing structure
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't really
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't necessarily change the
 
04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
character of the uh Community thanks
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely so with my own personal
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
example so we do have an existing
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
structure we have our detached garage so
 
04:17:48.590 --> 04:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
nothing would change there and if you're
 
04:17:51.110 --> 04:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
thinking about the dynamic of the people
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
that are already on my property it just
 
04:17:55.309 --> 04:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
kind of spreads us out a little bit so
 
04:17:57.889 --> 04:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
the the rural nature the character of
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
our community utilizing these structures
 
04:18:03.050 --> 04:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
that may become much better maintained
 
04:18:05.929 --> 04:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
because they are now being inhabited by
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else I think is is a benefit
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative hit
 
04:18:14.090 --> 04:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:18:15.650 --> 04:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
the question so some of our
 
04:18:17.450 --> 04:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities are struggling with
 
04:18:19.090 --> 04:18:19.100 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals
 
04:18:22.790 --> 04:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
in your experience in your profession
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
do you see that this is a potential
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
problem that somebody will
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
build an Adu and rent it out to one of
 
04:18:32.090 --> 04:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
those companies it is possible if there
 
04:18:33.650 --> 04:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
are no restrictions in place and I know
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that's definitely something that's
 
04:18:35.040 --> 04:18:36.650 align:start position:0%
that that's definitely something that's
being

04:18:36.650 --> 04:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes it's um relative to the workforce
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
housing associated with that third unit
 
04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
then there are some restrictions that
 
04:18:46.490 --> 04:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
are in place for that
 
04:18:46.500 --> 04:18:47.570 align:start position:0%
are in place for that
um but

04:18:47.570 --> 04:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:18:49.729 --> 04:18:49.739 align:start position:0%
yeah the towns would have the ability to
 
04:18:52.849 --> 04:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
to create representative
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
my question and I'm going to shift
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
towards not building more housing to
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
address the crisis how would this impact
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
the revenue in terms of taxes to the
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
Townsend municipalities yeah they would
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
be additional living spaces so it would
 
04:19:13.370 --> 04:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
be a benefit for the town and I know
 
04:19:16.370 --> 04:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
that there is some concern on the the
 
04:19:18.950 --> 04:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
part of the town for them to be to add
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
additional draws on the municipal
 
04:19:23.570 --> 04:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
resources but that would be compensated
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
by the taxation of those units
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you know more questions thank
 
04:19:30.349 --> 04:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony next
 
04:19:42.910 --> 04:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good afternoon

housing
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
it was my pleasure in 2016 to work with
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the development of the
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
now existing accessory dwelling unit law
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
and it's my pleasure to be before you
 
04:20:03.060 --> 04:20:03.910 align:start position:0%
and it's my pleasure to be before you
again

04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
the term housing crisis has been invoked
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
here to put a finer point on it New
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing will publish this
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
month a Statewide housing needs
 
04:20:16.729 --> 04:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
assessment that estimates that New
 
04:20:18.170 --> 04:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will need to produce over the
 
04:20:20.510 --> 04:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
next 20 years something on the order of
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
80 to 100
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
000 housing units
 
04:20:27.769 --> 04:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
to meet growth and changes in household
 
04:20:27.779 --> 04:20:29.389 align:start position:0%
to meet growth and changes in household
composition

04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
composition
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of Housing and we're not
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
building at that rate right now
 
04:20:36.110 --> 04:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
the existing accessory dwelling unit law
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
was an incremental step forward and
 
04:20:41.870 --> 04:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 423 also presents an
 
04:20:43.610 --> 04:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
incremental step forward
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
it will not solve the problem alone but
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
as part of
 
04:20:50.809 --> 04:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
a much broader Suite of solutions so I
 
04:20:52.490 --> 04:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
encourage your your consideration of
 
04:20:52.500 --> 04:20:54.110 align:start position:0%
encourage your your consideration of
this

04:20:54.110 --> 04:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
um what it does really is
 
04:21:00.650 --> 04:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
enable Property Owners to use their
 
04:21:00.660 --> 04:21:01.729 align:start position:0%
enable Property Owners to use their
property

04:21:01.729 --> 04:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
more broadly than they currently can
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
it gives them greater right to use their
 
04:21:11.450 --> 04:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
property as they see fit Within
 
04:21:13.849 --> 04:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions exercised by
 
04:21:13.859 --> 04:21:15.469 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions exercised by
municipalities

04:21:15.469 --> 04:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it does this without a single penny
 
04:21:21.769 --> 04:21:21.779 align:start position:0%
of public subsidy and this is something
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
really important to bear in mind as the
 
04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
legislature is considering a great
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
variety of Appropriations relative to
 
04:21:31.490 --> 04:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
housing this session
 
04:21:35.150 --> 04:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
this is a a solution that does not
 
04:21:38.570 --> 04:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
require Public Funding simply relies on
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
04:21:42.229 --> 04:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
to do what they want with their
 
04:21:45.170 --> 04:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
properties within the bounds of their
 
04:21:47.450 --> 04:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
local regulations
 
04:21:49.250 --> 04:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions Mr
 
04:21:49.260 --> 04:21:51.650 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions Mr
chairman

Mr chair and thank you Mr Frost for
 
04:21:57.590 --> 04:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
I have a question about wording in the
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
bill and in line 13 on page one of the
 
04:22:05.220 --> 04:22:06.290 align:start position:0%
bill and in line 13 on page one of the
bill

04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
it says two accessory dwelling units
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed without additional
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and then if you go to the
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
next page to line 34 there's a reference
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
to two or more accessory drilling units
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
I'm confused by that
 
04:22:26.809 --> 04:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
if this is only allowing two why would
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
it say two or more well if they want to
 
04:22:32.929 --> 04:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
allow more than two uh with House Bill
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
423 would require them to allow two a
 
04:22:38.269 --> 04:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
municipality may choose to do more than
 
04:22:38.279 --> 04:22:41.150 align:start position:0%
municipality may choose to do more than
that

04:22:41.150 --> 04:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.450 --> 04:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.729 --> 04:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative man chapudi
 
04:22:48.889 --> 04:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr T thank you for taking my
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
question how would this address the
 
04:22:54.849 --> 04:22:54.859 align:start position:0%
current waiting list for senior housing
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know other demographic there's a
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
long waiting list for housing because
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
there's no inventory how would this
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
address at least partially I know it's
 
04:23:08.330 --> 04:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
not a solution do you think it would
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
well that's a great question
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester at the as I
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
said and I'll I'll repeat what I said
 
04:23:18.610 --> 04:23:18.620 align:start position:0%
seven years ago
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
the bill then and the bill now would not
 
04:23:26.689 --> 04:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
in my estimation create a tidal wave of
 
04:23:30.189 --> 04:23:30.199 align:start position:0%
development but rather we would see very
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
incremental development and in fact that
 
04:23:36.110 --> 04:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
has been the response to the accessory
 
04:23:37.790 --> 04:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit law adopted by the
 
04:23:40.370 --> 04:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
legislature and enacted in 2016. it's
 
04:23:44.870 --> 04:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
been lot by lot here and there and I
 
04:23:47.630 --> 04:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
know there was one question
 
04:23:50.210 --> 04:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
and I forget who asked it about the the
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
representative imaginary might have been
 
04:23:55.969 --> 04:23:55.979 align:start position:0%
you the number of units produced there's
 
04:23:55.979 --> 04:23:57.050 align:start position:0%
you the number of units produced there's
no

04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:23:59.290 --> 04:23:59.300 align:start position:0%
real clear measure of that because
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
there's no one keeping track of that
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
you'd have to go to each municipality
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
and go through the building permit
 
04:24:07.729 --> 04:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
records to get to how many have been
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
produced I think
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen now I will tell you
 
04:24:14.210 --> 04:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I talked with the planners
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth and Merrimack and they see
 
04:24:19.490 --> 04:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
a dozen here a dozen they're not a huge
 
04:24:22.370 --> 04:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
number of of units produced but
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
incremental development further
 
04:24:23.939 --> 04:24:25.250 align:start position:0%
incremental development further
questions

04:24:25.250 --> 04:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
04:24:30.290 --> 04:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh next we have uh Nate
 
04:24:30.300 --> 04:24:34.790 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh next we have uh Nate
Grace

04:24:34.790 --> 04:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.769 --> 04:24:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and H craze for the
 
04:24:39.050 --> 04:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we do oppose this
 
04:24:40.969 --> 04:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
bill I do want to thank the sponsor for
 
04:24:42.650 --> 04:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
reaching out and accommodating some of
 
04:24:44.570 --> 04:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
our suggestions to moderate the bill but
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's still a Statewide zoning mandate
 
04:24:50.570 --> 04:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
and we oppose Statewide zoning mandates
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
um we are obviously concerned that this
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
would decrease the ability of
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate the type of
 
04:25:00.410 --> 04:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
growth that occurs
 
04:25:02.750 --> 04:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
um within their boundaries and regulate
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
their type of character and therefore we
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
would oppose this bill and have to take
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
any questions that the community may
 
04:25:08.640 --> 04:25:09.769 align:start position:0%
any questions that the community may
have

04:25:09.769 --> 04:25:09.779 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:25:11.450 --> 04:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any further
 
04:25:11.460 --> 04:25:12.610 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any further
questions

04:25:12.610 --> 04:25:12.620 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:25:17.150 --> 04:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.490 --> 04:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you as the previous fake speaker
 
04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
spoke about how people were
 
04:25:22.380 --> 04:25:22.929 align:start position:0%
spoke about how people were
um

04:25:22.929 --> 04:25:22.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:26.450 --> 04:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh wanting to use their property and be
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
have this flexibility
 
04:25:29.100 --> 04:25:30.189 align:start position:0%
have this flexibility
um

04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
and it's not a tidal wave but but
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
incremental of each individual person
 
04:25:39.170 --> 04:25:39.180 align:start position:0%
giving giving uh kind of their consent
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
to say use their property in the way
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
04:25:46.849 --> 04:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
um how do you feel that it is the um
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the restricting of municipalities
 
04:25:52.189 --> 04:25:52.199 align:start position:0%
on those people's property
 
04:25:54.410 --> 04:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
um rights is is
 
04:25:54.420 --> 04:25:56.050 align:start position:0%
um rights is is
um

04:25:56.050 --> 04:25:56.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
contributing I guess to the housing
 
04:25:58.620 --> 04:25:59.570 align:start position:0%
contributing I guess to the housing
crisis

04:25:59.570 --> 04:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
04:26:02.330 --> 04:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
that that we that the state is facing
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I I don't think that's the
 
04:26:06.649 --> 04:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
major driving Factor but I I don't think
 
04:26:08.809 --> 04:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's relevant to the build language so
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that your chair is going to
 
04:26:14.990 --> 04:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
further questions representative got
 
04:26:20.750 --> 04:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:26:23.570 --> 04:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you see
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh could you would you comment please on
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences that this
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
bill would result in particularly the
 
04:26:34.849 --> 04:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
impact it might have on the overall
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
zoning in each community
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
04:26:41.929 --> 04:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
sure so uh
 
04:26:45.649 --> 04:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
if so property rights are really uh
 
04:26:47.809 --> 04:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
often described in the law as a bundle
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
of sticks where you have different
 
04:26:51.170 --> 04:26:51.180 align:start position:0%
rights that are kind of in this this
 
04:26:55.250 --> 04:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
pile and we give up some of those uh
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
under planning and zoning laws so that
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
we can come together as a community and
 
04:27:01.610 --> 04:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
plan collectively
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and so part of the unintended
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
consequences that would occur for this
 
04:27:09.170 --> 04:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
is we'd have less ability for something
 
04:27:11.929 --> 04:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
like the master plan to help direct what
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
the what the growth is of the community
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
it would be more an individual
 
04:27:19.389 --> 04:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
individual lot by lot basis which would
 
04:27:22.130 --> 04:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh make it more difficult for the
 
04:27:24.170 --> 04:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
municipality to anticipate what kinds of
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
needs will occur in the future
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
hey thank you Mr chairman representative
 
04:27:29.880 --> 04:27:31.370 align:start position:0%
hey thank you Mr chairman representative
priest

04:27:31.370 --> 04:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
priest
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm confused
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
um because I I don't see any mandates
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
that a property owner has to do this so
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
by saying that this is an unfended
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
mandate I I don't see it can you uh
 
04:27:49.849 --> 04:27:49.859 align:start position:0%
enlighten me
 
04:27:52.370 --> 04:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
well it's a land use mandate because it
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
would restrict the
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities ability to adopt or
 
04:28:00.170 --> 04:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
continue to have a zoning code that
 
04:28:03.769 --> 04:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
would limit the number of units dwelling
 
04:28:06.050 --> 04:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
units on a on a property by mandating
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they have allow up to two instead
 
04:28:10.809 --> 04:28:10.819 align:start position:0%
of just one as current
 
04:28:14.689 --> 04:28:14.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:16.910 --> 04:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
I hope that made sense but you're
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
looking more confused
 
04:28:21.530 --> 04:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up as a follow-up go
 
04:28:24.410 --> 04:28:24.420 align:start position:0%
ahead do you believe that the existing
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
zoning that restricts the number of
 
04:28:31.729 --> 04:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
units per lot is basically
 
04:28:33.290 --> 04:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
04:28:35.330 --> 04:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
um discriminatory because you're
 
04:28:35.340 --> 04:28:36.969 align:start position:0%
um discriminatory because you're
basically

04:28:36.969 --> 04:28:36.979 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
limiting the use of those lots and
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
um you're taking away the rights of the
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
04:28:52.729 --> 04:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.530 --> 04:28:54.540 align:start position:0%
I think there was a question in there
 
04:28:55.849 --> 04:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
there was a question
 
04:29:01.130 --> 04:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:06.050 --> 04:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
the last pink card I have on this bill
 
04:29:16.689 --> 04:29:16.699 align:start position:0%

severe housing crisis thank you for

is in strong support of this bill
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
um many of the key points have been made
 
04:30:03.769 --> 04:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
by prior testifiers
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
um what I thought I would do is just
 
04:30:07.010 --> 04:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
share with you our perspective we were
 
04:30:09.649 --> 04:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
one of the many organizations who came
 
04:30:14.330 --> 04:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
together in 2015 and 2016 to pass SB 146
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
and it was a real coming together many
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
folks were very concerned about property
 
04:30:24.410 --> 04:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
rights and had been battling often at
 
04:30:26.689 --> 04:30:26.699 align:start position:0%
the local level about how to address
 
04:30:30.410 --> 04:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
family needs particularly around caring
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
for aging parents and dealing with adult
 
04:30:36.410 --> 04:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities in fact our
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
governor at the time who signed this Adu
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
law in in the ad SB 146 into law had
 
04:30:47.450 --> 04:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
experienced that herself right she had
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
to find a town that would accommodate
 
04:30:54.170 --> 04:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
her to to provide housing for her adult
 
04:30:57.170 --> 04:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
son with disabilities so we had come
 
04:31:00.110 --> 04:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
together with AARP and the DD council at
 
04:31:01.070 --> 04:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
and property rights organizations to
 
04:31:06.889 --> 04:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
make the arguments that created the Adu
 
04:31:06.899 --> 04:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
make the arguments that created the Adu
law

04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:31:12.769 --> 04:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
and it even despite very low interest
 
04:31:16.610 --> 04:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
rates and essentially easy access to
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
funds we have seen a sprinkling of adus
 
04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
kind of throughout the state where it
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
made sense at this point we don't have
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
conclusive data on what the impact was
 
04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
but I know that the concerns that were
 
04:31:33.469 --> 04:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
raised at the time during you know the
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtful debate that we had that would
 
04:31:38.769 --> 04:31:38.779 align:start position:0%
be we would create an Airbnb disaster
 
04:31:41.530 --> 04:31:41.540 align:start position:0%
particularly in the Taurus regions never
 
04:31:44.450 --> 04:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
never materialized I live in the city of
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth I can just tell you
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
anecdotally my neighbor wanted to
 
04:31:50.809 --> 04:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
convert her Barn it was detached she was
 
04:31:54.769 --> 04:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
denied by the city after Adu law passed
 
04:31:59.210 --> 04:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
it she was successful and provided a
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
home for her aging dad her dad has
 
04:32:04.490 --> 04:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
recently passed away and a neighbor's
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
parent is now living in the converted
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
barn and so I urge you to support the
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
expansion of our very successful Adu law
 
04:32:15.349 --> 04:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
04:32:15.359 --> 04:32:18.590 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
you

04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.469 --> 04:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative majority thank you Mr
 
04:32:22.610 --> 04:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:32:25.010 --> 04:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
question uh we've heard from a previous
 
04:32:27.410 --> 04:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
a witness and now I've heard again from
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
you we have a sprinkling of adus I'm
 
04:32:33.610 --> 04:32:33.620 align:start position:0%
again trying to get to how how does
 
04:32:37.969 --> 04:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
increasing to two help us and I'm
 
04:32:40.010 --> 04:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
wondering then if you might think that
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
what we'll have is multiple units on
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
those multiple Lots rather than a
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
proliferation throughout the state does
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
that make any sense I I do I mean I I
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can really anticipate
 
04:32:55.250 --> 04:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
that right it's really depends on what
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
the what a family's needs are and
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
um and and what they decide to build and
 
04:33:04.490 --> 04:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
so far we haven't seen kind of a mass
 
04:33:06.650 --> 04:33:06.660 align:start position:0%
build out I will say from housing action
 
04:33:08.150 --> 04:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's point of view I mean
 
04:33:09.949 --> 04:33:09.959 align:start position:0%
most of our members are multi-family
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
developers you know we don't see this as
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
the magic solution for dealing with the
 
04:33:16.730 --> 04:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
80 to 100
 
04:33:18.289 --> 04:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
000 you know units that the state's
 
04:33:20.810 --> 04:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
going to need over the next 20 years but
 
04:33:24.890 --> 04:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
we do think it's gentle density we do
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
think that it is
 
04:33:27.719 --> 04:33:28.490 align:start position:0%
think that it is
um

04:33:28.490 --> 04:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
it's a way for communities to really
 
04:33:30.959 --> 04:33:32.949 align:start position:0%
it's a way for communities to really
Embrace

04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
Embrace
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
providing this housing and particularly
 
04:33:38.510 --> 04:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
you know one of our challenges really as
 
04:33:40.609 --> 04:33:40.619 align:start position:0%
an affordable housing Coalition is some
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the adus that are developed are not
 
04:33:44.449 --> 04:33:44.459 align:start position:0%
affordable right I mean they're they're
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
market rate or more but they take the
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
pressure off of the market in a way so
 
04:33:53.689 --> 04:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
say for example your family with means
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
and you have an adult child with
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities and you don't want to put
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
them in the system you can provide
 
04:34:03.051 --> 04:34:03.061 align:start position:0%
at-home care and uh you know and and
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
keep them on your property and care for
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
them instead of um you know putting them
 
04:34:10.490 --> 04:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
in a system with you know in some kind
 
04:34:12.410 --> 04:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
of a group service scenario and then
 
04:34:14.449 --> 04:34:14.459 align:start position:0%
that leaves room for other folks who
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.000 --> 04:34:20.209 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
 
04:34:22.320 --> 04:34:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
question

04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:34:23.520 --> 04:34:26.869 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
um do you think that uh some of the
 
04:34:32.810 --> 04:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
reason that there's only a sprinkling
 
04:34:35.631 --> 04:34:35.641 align:start position:0%
um might have to do with this detect
 
04:34:38.209 --> 04:34:38.219 align:start position:0%
this definition of attached which is now
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
get going to be more uh allowing for the
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
people that previous like the people
 
04:34:46.730 --> 04:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
that previously testified about they
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
have a structure that is that um that is
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
existing that they may uh be able to put
 
04:34:56.209 --> 04:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
someone in
 
04:34:58.189 --> 04:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
um that may not be attached because they
 
04:34:59.570 --> 04:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
don't want to share a wall maybe
 
04:35:01.849 --> 04:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
necessarily but they have you know a
 
04:35:04.369 --> 04:35:04.379 align:start position:0%
garage and so that would open up the
 
04:35:07.250 --> 04:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
um this law to maybe a wider audience
 
04:35:10.010 --> 04:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
than than the current existing law I see
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:35:12.890 --> 04:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative I think I understand your
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is when we
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
passed SB 146 you know uh the the state
 
04:35:21.769 --> 04:35:21.779 align:start position:0%
said that a municipalities ordinance
 
04:35:24.650 --> 04:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
must at least provide for an attached
 
04:35:27.051 --> 04:35:27.061 align:start position:0%
but if the municipality wanted to they
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
could do detached and for example in the
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
city of Portsmouth they do allow for
 
04:35:32.689 --> 04:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
detached and they're I think
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically yes I mean if the state
 
04:35:39.709 --> 04:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
enhances the current statute to say the
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
municipality must also allow for
 
04:35:45.051 --> 04:35:45.061 align:start position:0%
detached you would be freeing up the
 
04:35:47.330 --> 04:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
property owner and their rights to do
 
04:35:49.010 --> 04:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
with what they want with their property
 
04:35:51.650 --> 04:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
to you know and maybe that flexibility
 
04:35:53.689 --> 04:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
would be more of an incentive for them
 
04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie thank you Mr
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
chairman for letting me have a question
 
04:36:03.719 --> 04:36:04.789 align:start position:0%
chairman for letting me have a question
again

04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:36:07.490 --> 04:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think I missed something and maybe you
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
can help me with
 
04:36:12.410 --> 04:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh water and sewer
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
did I miss that did we just
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
what impact does this do in communities
 
04:36:20.631 --> 04:36:20.641 align:start position:0%
that don't have
 
04:36:20.641 --> 04:36:21.709 align:start position:0%
that don't have
water

04:36:21.709 --> 04:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
and have septic systems and you're
 
04:36:25.320 --> 04:36:27.170 align:start position:0%
and have septic systems and you're
doubling

04:36:27.170 --> 04:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
doubling
 
04:36:30.410 --> 04:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
the size of the home was on the lot
 
04:36:33.051 --> 04:36:33.061 align:start position:0%
but and originally it was probably
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
brought in into account that was weighed
 
04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
in to their ability to build
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
and now you're just saying hey doesn't
 
04:36:41.810 --> 04:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
mean any different make any difference
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
we can double that
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't think you
 
04:36:49.250 --> 04:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
missed it and I I I probably am not the
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
right witness to really testify as to
 
04:36:53.929 --> 04:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
the technical aspects but I think when
 
04:36:56.689 --> 04:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
this came up in 2015 and 2016 it's kind
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
of no different than if your aunt came
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
to live within your home or you had a
 
04:37:04.010 --> 04:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
new baby or you know you're adding just
 
04:37:06.410 --> 04:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
like it's a very gentle density so I
 
04:37:08.209 --> 04:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
think that the consensus at the time was
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's not very taxing
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
um on if you have septic or or you know
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
the current water sewer infrastructure
 
04:37:17.631 --> 04:37:17.641 align:start position:0%
that I think that that helps a lot thank
 
04:37:21.289 --> 04:37:21.299 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you representative
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
second Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:37:26.090 --> 04:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
question would this help the sandwich
 
04:37:29.150 --> 04:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
generation where you're caring for your
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
children maybe in a child with
 
04:37:34.209 --> 04:37:34.219 align:start position:0%
disability as well as the aging parent
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to navigate to this would
 
04:37:39.890 --> 04:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
give an opportunity for a sandwich
 
04:37:43.369 --> 04:37:43.379 align:start position:0%
generation to have that ability to live
 
04:37:45.890 --> 04:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
in one place with adus you thank you for
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
the question representative um indeed
 
04:37:50.810 --> 04:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
the much of the political momentum in
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
2015 and 2016 was this coming together
 
04:37:57.310 --> 04:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
of both this concern this human concern
 
04:38:01.970 --> 04:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
for caring for uh for folks given how
 
04:38:03.650 --> 04:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
few choices we have in the state around
 
04:38:07.609 --> 04:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
housing and the desire to do what one
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
wants to do with their own property I
 
04:38:11.929 --> 04:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
will say that I believe some water sewer
 
04:38:14.510 --> 04:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
languages is in the in the bill at the
 
04:38:17.330 --> 04:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
top of page two and so I'll just refer
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
you to that representative Guthrie
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
04:38:22.199 --> 04:38:24.230 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank

04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
last pink card we have on that bill I
 
04:38:29.570 --> 04:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
have the blue sign up sheet I have uh
 
04:38:31.789 --> 04:38:31.799 align:start position:0%
let's see six people who signed in four
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
against and two four
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the hearing on
 
04:38:39.289 --> 04:38:39.299 align:start position:0%
HB 423
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
I will be introducing the next bill so
 
04:38:44.689 --> 04:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
represent Vice chair power will be the

04:38:51.420 --> 04:39:28.849 align:start position:0%
 
oops

04:39:28.849 --> 04:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
well I see a dog with
 
04:39:46.130 --> 04:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
I do I see a Scotty
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
the time is 2 43 and I will open the
 
04:39:57.770 --> 04:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 270 relative to
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
the election of Stratford County
 
04:39:59.640 --> 04:40:01.070 align:start position:0%
the election of Stratford County
Commissioners

04:40:01.070 --> 04:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the prime sponsor
 
04:40:05.570 --> 04:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte to introduce the
 
04:40:05.580 --> 04:40:06.590 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte to introduce the
bill

04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:40:09.050 --> 04:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair indeed
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Len turcotte current
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative for Stratford County
 
04:40:16.910 --> 04:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
District 4 which are the towns of
 
04:40:20.330 --> 04:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
Barrington and Stratford currently in my
 
04:40:23.090 --> 04:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
fourth term I served three terms on
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
labor last year I served on labor
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
finance and more importantly the special
 
04:40:31.670 --> 04:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting that happens
 
04:40:35.330 --> 04:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.368 --> 04:40:40.378 align:start position:0%
I've passed out a handout I would have
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
loved to have it for you in color it
 
04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
makes it a lot easier to read
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they won't reproduce that
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
here so
 
04:40:50.208 --> 04:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
I different Shades of Gray for you I'll
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
get into those a little bit later along
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
with the attach sheet which is a little
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
bit of data I'll explain that as I go
 
04:40:56.878 --> 04:40:58.190 align:start position:0%
bit of data I'll explain that as I go
along

04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
along
 
04:41:00.850 --> 04:41:00.860 align:start position:0%
so Stratford county is the only County
 
04:41:03.170 --> 04:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
within the state there are 10 counties
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
it's the only County where we elect
 
04:41:10.208 --> 04:41:10.218 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners at large rather than
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
electing them by commissioner districts
 
04:41:17.810 --> 04:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:41:22.250 --> 04:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
RSA that talks about that 662-4 and it
 
04:41:24.170 --> 04:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
says except for Stratford County where
 
04:41:26.090 --> 04:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners shall be elected at
 
04:41:28.910 --> 04:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
large for the purpose of choosing County
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the county shall be
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
divided into districts and follows as
 
04:41:34.970 --> 04:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
follows and that goes into a list of
 
04:41:37.208 --> 04:41:37.218 align:start position:0%
each individual County
 
04:41:39.830 --> 04:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
and how they those commissioner
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.410 --> 04:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
as I said last term I served on the
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
special committee for redistricting and
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
we had actually intended and discussed
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
including this in the 10-year
 
04:42:02.570 --> 04:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan but we thought that
 
04:42:04.788 --> 04:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
it might kind of throw a little bit of
 
04:42:07.490 --> 04:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
too much into the process many of you
 
04:42:11.510 --> 04:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
might have known the data came into us
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
about six seven months later than it was
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to due to the covid so we were
 
04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
kind of rushed and we just didn't want
 
04:42:21.170 --> 04:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
this interfering with the redistricting
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
process that that we had to deal with
 
04:42:24.540 --> 04:42:25.730 align:start position:0%
process that that we had to deal with
already

04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:42:28.730 --> 04:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we decided we'd wait
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
and introduce it this term
 
04:42:35.930 --> 04:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
what we did during redistricting last
 
04:42:39.050 --> 04:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
time is we actually went around
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
to every County and held what we called
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
listening sessions where we took
 
04:42:47.510 --> 04:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
comments from the public every County we
 
04:42:49.610 --> 04:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
just we went to their counties and
 
04:42:49.620 --> 04:42:50.750 align:start position:0%
just we went to their counties and
listened

04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
listened
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
and almost unanimously I think I was
 
04:42:56.570 --> 04:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
able to attend eight of the 10 hearings
 
04:43:00.050 --> 04:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
and the the one issue we heard over and
 
04:43:02.810 --> 04:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
over and over is and we were there
 
04:43:07.128 --> 04:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
mainly for uh redistricting of uh County
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
State reps but also for the
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners but everybody the one
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
thing that we wrote down time after time
 
04:43:16.730 --> 04:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
was fairness they wanted to see maps
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
that were Fair
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
I think in at least in terms of the
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
current State Rep
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
distribution of 201 to 198 I I'm not
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
sure we could have drawn maps that were
 
04:43:32.690 --> 04:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
much more fair
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
but what we have in Stratford county is
 
04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
just the opposite of that we do not have
 
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh fairness in our County and the reason
 
04:43:41.040 --> 04:43:42.530 align:start position:0%
uh fairness in our County and the reason
is

04:43:42.530 --> 04:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
when you elect
 
04:43:47.810 --> 04:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
at large in a County
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:43:51.650 --> 04:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
for sake of argument I'll give you the
 
04:43:57.410 --> 04:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
exact numbers later but 60 40 Democrat
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners that come out of
 
04:44:02.208 --> 04:44:02.218 align:start position:0%
that election every two years are three
 
04:44:02.218 --> 04:44:03.708 align:start position:0%
that election every two years are three
Democrats

04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
Democrats
 
04:44:06.530 --> 04:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
and as long as I've been around the
 
04:44:08.448 --> 04:44:08.458 align:start position:0%
majority of those have come from the
 
04:44:11.448 --> 04:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
cities of Dover Rochester
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
and Somersworth
 
04:44:18.110 --> 04:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
so not only does this disenfranchise and
 
04:44:19.788 --> 04:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
in this case in the in the case of
 
04:44:22.368 --> 04:44:22.378 align:start position:0%
fairness for the Republic for the lack
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
of Republicans on the commissioners
 
04:44:25.320 --> 04:44:26.150 align:start position:0%
of Republicans on the commissioners
um

04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the commissioner's office and also
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises the voters
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:38.570 --> 04:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
in our County we have Durham Madbury Lee
 
04:44:40.010 --> 04:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
Barrington Stratford New Durham
 
04:44:42.288 --> 04:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
Farmington Middleton and Milton
 
04:44:45.010 --> 04:44:45.020 align:start position:0%
that becomes second thoughts
 
04:44:49.368 --> 04:44:49.378 align:start position:0%
when dealing with County issues
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
I believe there are going to be some
 
04:44:53.330 --> 04:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
testifying today that are going to speak
 
04:44:55.330 --> 04:44:55.340 align:start position:0%
more to that point so I'm not going to
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
get into
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
some of those reasonings and let them do
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:06.890 --> 04:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
so now I want to talk a little bit about
 
04:45:10.128 --> 04:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
the the data well actually first
 
04:45:13.610 --> 04:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
um yeah let's talk about the data first
 
04:45:17.448 --> 04:45:17.458 align:start position:0%
so on the current map that that I handed
 
04:45:19.730 --> 04:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
out uh that when you look at that map
 
04:45:23.330 --> 04:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
it'll say D1 D2 D3 those are the
 
04:45:25.850 --> 04:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
districts that are being proposed in
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.530 --> 04:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
the current map is based on
 
04:45:35.288 --> 04:45:35.298 align:start position:0%
of course the
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
2020 census data
 
04:45:39.480 --> 04:45:41.750 align:start position:0%
2020 census data
and

04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:45.770 --> 04:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
this map here would have resulted based
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
on the 2022 election in a roughly 60 40
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
split if you go to the data page
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
and you look in the lower right hand
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
district one it says total r
 
04:46:08.090 --> 04:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
there were 20
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
based on the 22 2022 election
 
04:46:18.170 --> 04:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
there were 23 589 R's in District One
 
04:46:21.948 --> 04:46:21.958 align:start position:0%
there were 22 276 votes cast for
 
04:46:26.890 --> 04:46:26.900 align:start position:0%
democrats for a split of 51.4 to
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
48.6 So based on the 2022 election you
 
04:46:34.368 --> 04:46:34.378 align:start position:0%
would have had a republican win district
 
04:46:34.378 --> 04:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
would have had a republican win district
one

04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
by roughly 3 percent
 
04:46:43.368 --> 04:46:43.378 align:start position:0%
if you go to District 2 which that's the
 
04:46:45.470 --> 04:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
one that's kind of highlighted in the
 
04:46:45.480 --> 04:46:47.930 align:start position:0%
one that's kind of highlighted in the
the

04:46:47.930 --> 04:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.350 --> 04:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
the the thick line there
 
04:46:51.360 --> 04:46:52.070 align:start position:0%
the the thick line there
um

04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:53.650 --> 04:46:53.660 align:start position:0%
in that District
 
04:46:57.010 --> 04:46:57.020 align:start position:0%
15057 our votes 38
 
04:47:00.650 --> 04:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
167 D Depot so you can see in that uh
 
04:47:02.868 --> 04:47:02.878 align:start position:0%
District if that would have existed in
 
04:47:06.470 --> 04:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
2022 that would actually been a 28.3
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
percent Republican 71.7 percent uh
 
04:47:11.810 --> 04:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
Democrats so that would have been a
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
Democrat seat and then in the final
 
04:47:16.490 --> 04:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
District three uh again I won't read the
 
04:47:19.070 --> 04:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
exact numbers but it was a 45 to 54
 
04:47:21.830 --> 04:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
split that would have also been a
 
04:47:26.570 --> 04:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
Democrat seat so based on 2022 election
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
data you would have ended up with to
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
Democrat Commissioners and one
 
04:47:38.890 --> 04:47:38.900 align:start position:0%
Republican which again uh is more
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative of the actual County of
 
04:47:44.030 --> 04:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
Stratford you look down that the last
 
04:47:45.170 --> 04:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
number below there you'll see
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
county-wide the county-wide vote totals
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
were 41.3 Republican and 58.7 for the
 
04:47:52.680 --> 04:47:59.810 align:start position:0%
were 41.3 Republican and 58.7 for the
Democrats

04:47:59.810 --> 04:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:04.490 --> 04:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
now in drawing the the map itself
 
04:48:07.010 --> 04:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
as I said I was on the redistricting
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee my main focus last time around
 
04:48:12.288 --> 04:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
was on the House of Representatives
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
districts there were other individuals
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
that their main um
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
Focus was the Commissioners but on this
 
04:48:21.120 --> 04:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
Focus was the Commissioners but on this
one

04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:48:26.750 --> 04:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll notice that
 
04:48:29.708 --> 04:48:29.718 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
when you draw any kind of a map there's
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
certain things that you have to maintain
 
04:48:39.170 --> 04:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh to make to make sure that they meet a
 
04:48:43.250 --> 04:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh U.S constitutional New
 
04:48:46.010 --> 04:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitutional and other rules
 
04:48:48.530 --> 04:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
that are set up for districts
 
04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
so you will see for instance uh let me
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
go back one of the the prime absolute
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
requirement when drawing districts is uh
 
04:48:58.080 --> 04:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
requirement when drawing districts is uh
deviation

04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
04:49:01.730 --> 04:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay the U.S Constitution is very very
 
04:49:04.250 --> 04:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
very very clear and every time there's
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
been a case it it is the the main issue
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
that you have to conform to and that's
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
the one person one vote issue
 
04:49:15.530 --> 04:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
um and the U.S Constitution has set that
 
04:49:18.650 --> 04:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
an allowable deviation at 10 so in other
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
words when we draw draw Maps you try to
 
04:49:23.990 --> 04:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
get minus five to plus five so you have
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
no more than a ten percent deviation if
 
04:49:27.770 --> 04:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
you go over 10 percent deviation it's an
 
04:49:30.350 --> 04:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
automatic go into court it's it's it's
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
found illegal
 
04:49:34.570 --> 04:49:34.580 align:start position:0%
so for drawing Stratford County
 
04:49:38.208 --> 04:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.208 --> 04:49:41.218 align:start position:0%
um there are different ways to do it
 
04:49:45.288 --> 04:49:45.298 align:start position:0%
the way this map is drawn actually is
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
with a total deviation you look at that
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
data sheet now on the upper left hand
 
04:49:56.330 --> 04:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
side and you'll see the deviation total
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the for the county is 4.13 that's
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
extremely low that was the lowest uh
 
04:50:06.288 --> 04:50:06.298 align:start position:0%
deviation I could come up with
 
04:50:06.298 --> 04:50:09.170 align:start position:0%
deviation I could come up with
um

04:50:09.170 --> 04:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
and what were the other points I had on
 
04:50:12.120 --> 04:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
and what were the other points I had on
that

04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:14.160 --> 04:50:15.650 align:start position:0%
that
okay

04:50:15.650 --> 04:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
um yeah of course another big one they
 
04:50:19.550 --> 04:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
have to be contiguous you know you can't
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
you can't for instance pair Durham with
 
04:50:26.090 --> 04:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh New Durham they they have to touch
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
their border so when you're drawing the
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
maps they have to be contiguous
 
04:50:30.000 --> 04:50:33.050 align:start position:0%
maps they have to be contiguous
so

04:50:33.050 --> 04:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I anticipate may
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
come up
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
is why couldn't you keep the cities
 
04:50:43.550 --> 04:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
together in a County
 
04:50:46.128 --> 04:50:46.138 align:start position:0%
two two responses to that one currently
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
you have an entire County that
 
04:50:50.410 --> 04:50:50.420 align:start position:0%
encompasses everything so it's it's
 
04:50:53.090 --> 04:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
you're kind of already doing that but
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
the main reason is there is no
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
possible way to draw
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Commissioners District
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
without taking Awards and combining them
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
with towns if you go to the upper right
 
04:51:10.670 --> 04:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
hand corner of that data sheet I gave
 
04:51:10.680 --> 04:51:11.868 align:start position:0%
hand corner of that data sheet I gave
you

04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:51:14.448 --> 04:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
that number there
 
04:51:17.628 --> 04:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
I attempted to draw Maps keeping the
 
04:51:21.230 --> 04:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
cities together the lowest
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
total County deviation I could come up
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
with and that anybody can come up with
 
04:51:29.810 --> 04:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.150 --> 04:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
and again I said 10 that's the maximum
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
you go into court you're going to lose
 
04:51:38.270 --> 04:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
it it's just it's it's automatic
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
so you say well are there any other
 
04:51:41.510 --> 04:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
counties like that yeah matter of fact
 
04:51:44.208 --> 04:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of the counties that for
 
04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
the state reps that we drew it's uh very
 
04:51:48.770 --> 04:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
similar uh three or four counties we've
 
04:51:50.448 --> 04:51:50.458 align:start position:0%
had to do that and in fact one of the
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
Commissioners districts Belknap County
 
04:51:55.128 --> 04:51:55.138 align:start position:0%
also does that and again it's because
 
04:51:57.050 --> 04:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
you have to keep your numbers within
 
04:52:01.070 --> 04:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
that deviation range and
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
um bellnap includes for instance their
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
District three
 
04:52:09.890 --> 04:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
they have Alton Barnstead Guilford
 
04:52:13.550 --> 04:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
and Laconia Ward 2 only
 
04:52:15.890 --> 04:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
and you have to drag that Ward 2 in
 
04:52:18.050 --> 04:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
there to get the the numbers to balance
 
04:52:20.150 --> 04:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
out in the in the county the one person
 
04:52:23.208 --> 04:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
so I know there's a lot of other people
 
04:52:27.170 --> 04:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
who are going to testify for this so I
 
04:52:29.330 --> 04:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
will leave that at there I'd be happy to
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
answer any questions anybody has
 
04:52:33.770 --> 04:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turcotte for
 
04:52:36.050 --> 04:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
your bill introduction so I see some
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
hands for questions Representatives
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
Davis is acknowledged
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:52:45.050 --> 04:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a little bit
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
like the question I asked of the tax
 
04:52:49.730 --> 04:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
assessor can you explain this to me like
 
04:52:53.448 --> 04:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.368 --> 04:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm kind of lost in the
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
statistics and I
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
think I understand
 
04:53:04.128 --> 04:53:04.138 align:start position:0%
but I'm actually not sure I understand
 
04:53:06.770 --> 04:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
so I need you know the the dummies
 
04:53:10.750 --> 04:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
version sure which part of it which part
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
I I guess I guess the part of it
 
04:53:18.350 --> 04:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
that you characterize as unfair yep
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
unfair in that for the last few decades
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
I think with the exception of one term
 
04:53:28.270 --> 04:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
the county has elected uh three Democrat
 
04:53:31.730 --> 04:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioners every time
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
in a county that is representative
 
04:53:38.930 --> 04:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
the word is democratic not Democrat I'm
 
04:53:41.208 --> 04:53:41.218 align:start position:0%
sorry to interrupt you
 
04:53:44.330 --> 04:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative 11 you were not
 
04:53:47.330 --> 04:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by the chair and please
 
04:53:50.208 --> 04:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
please follow that rule
 
04:53:52.850 --> 04:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's what you what you end
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
up is with it all Commissioners are
 
04:53:56.040 --> 04:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
up is with it all Commissioners are
Democrats

04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
in a democrat in a commit in a county
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
that is 60 percent Democrat 40 percent
 
04:54:06.718 --> 04:54:08.570 align:start position:0%
that is 60 percent Democrat 40 percent
Republican

04:54:08.570 --> 04:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
Republican
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
so by going to like every other County
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
does where you have districts this would
 
04:54:18.410 --> 04:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
the the data that I showed you on there
 
04:54:20.990 --> 04:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
from uh 2022
 
04:54:24.410 --> 04:54:24.420 align:start position:0%
it would have produced two Democrats
 
04:54:26.750 --> 04:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
and one Republican
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's the fairness issue the fairness
 
04:54:30.770 --> 04:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
issue that I spoke of is when we went
 
04:54:32.330 --> 04:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
around to all the counties when we were
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
doing redistricting
 
04:54:33.958 --> 04:54:35.410 align:start position:0%
doing redistricting
was

04:54:35.410 --> 04:54:35.420 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:54:38.530 --> 04:54:38.540 align:start position:0%
at the time as you know it was a
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
republican-controlled house
 
04:54:43.250 --> 04:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
and Time After Time After Time we heard
 
04:54:43.260 --> 04:54:45.708 align:start position:0%
and Time After Time After Time we heard
repetitively

04:54:45.708 --> 04:54:45.718 align:start position:0%
repetitively
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
we want fairness in the maps that that
 
04:54:50.990 --> 04:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
are being drawn
 
04:54:54.128 --> 04:54:54.138 align:start position:0%
that's the fairness issue
 
04:54:57.170 --> 04:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative yokela is acknowledged
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for transporting
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
this committee to election law
 
04:55:02.160 --> 04:55:03.350 align:start position:0%
this committee to election law
um

04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:03.360 --> 04:55:05.090 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:55:05.090 --> 04:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
04:55:11.330 --> 04:55:11.340 align:start position:0%
um how does this uh
 
04:55:11.340 --> 04:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
um how does this uh
law

04:55:13.910 --> 04:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
go in why doesn't this law go into
 
04:55:18.650 --> 04:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
effect in the next election and why does
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
it go in in 60 days and how is that
 
04:55:24.590 --> 04:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
um going the bill
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
to be the bill itself takes effect 60
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
days but it would actually be on the
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:36.350 --> 04:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
does it say that in the bill
 
04:55:45.650 --> 04:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think it says that specifically
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
but that's the inference that you I mean
 
04:55:53.208 --> 04:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
it's not the bill isn't there to take
 
04:55:56.410 --> 04:55:56.420 align:start position:0%
the current Commissioners out of there
 
04:55:58.670 --> 04:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
their current position it's going
 
04:55:58.680 --> 04:56:03.410 align:start position:0%
their current position it's going
forward

04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.690 --> 04:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:56:05.700 --> 04:56:07.490 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
mangaputi

04:56:07.490 --> 04:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
mangaputi
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:56:11.510 --> 04:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative turcott for taking my
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
question my question is fairness on
 
04:56:17.510 --> 04:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
question of fairness
 
04:56:20.150 --> 04:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
I come from Hillsborough County
 
04:56:23.570 --> 04:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
when we are looking at Commissioners are
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
we looking at Commissioners or
 
04:56:31.970 --> 04:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
republican or democrat or are the voters
 
04:56:33.830 --> 04:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
electing Commissioners who have been
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
effective or what their platform is this
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
should be a non-partisan
 
04:56:46.430 --> 04:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
representation so how would this make it
 
04:56:49.810 --> 04:56:49.820 align:start position:0%
fair and
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I think I've
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
explained that a couple times it says
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
the question is you have a and I I don't
 
04:57:01.910 --> 04:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
know what your commissioner's situation
 
04:57:07.190 --> 04:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
but if you elect at large three
 
04:57:12.890 --> 04:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
individuals three commissioners
 
04:57:15.410 --> 04:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
at large which means the entire County
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
votes on those three commissioners
 
04:57:22.510 --> 04:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
and the county is 60 percent
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats and 40 percent Republicans
 
04:57:30.650 --> 04:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
the result is going to be what I am
 
04:57:32.448 --> 04:57:32.458 align:start position:0%
saying and what many people have
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the past an unfair result
 
04:57:40.128 --> 04:57:40.138 align:start position:0%
of three Democrats being elected
 
04:57:42.050 --> 04:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
04:57:43.730 --> 04:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
true fairness
 
04:57:48.530 --> 04:57:48.540 align:start position:0%
if that's what we're going to go for
 
04:57:50.570 --> 04:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
much like our House of Representatives
 
04:57:56.448 --> 04:57:56.458 align:start position:0%
is 201 to 190 whatever at 7 or 98.
 
04:57:58.128 --> 04:57:58.138 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think you can get much more
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
fair division of Democrats and
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans than that in our County it's
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
the only County where we re elect at
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
large if you go to what I've produced
 
04:58:08.760 --> 04:58:09.590 align:start position:0%
large if you go to what I've produced
here

04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:58:13.610 --> 04:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
based on the 2022 results you would end
 
04:58:16.490 --> 04:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
up with two Democrat Commissioners and
 
04:58:17.810 --> 04:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
one Republican
 
04:58:19.250 --> 04:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
that to me is
 
04:58:23.890 --> 04:58:23.900 align:start position:0%
Fair unfairness would be the ability
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
of a county with 40 percent Republicans
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
saddled with three
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
democrats for decades
 
04:58:39.530 --> 04:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up Madam chair
 
04:58:41.510 --> 04:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
I will not allow that at this time those
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
other Representatives that would like to
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
ask initial questions and I can Circle
 
04:58:47.570 --> 04:58:47.580 align:start position:0%
back to you
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill is acknowledged
 
04:58:53.448 --> 04:58:53.458 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:58:57.650 --> 04:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:01.010 --> 04:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
in the last say 10 elections do you know
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
how many Commissioners actually came
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
from this Northern District that you're
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.890 --> 04:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:14.810 --> 04:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not going to be able to
 
04:59:16.250 --> 04:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
give you an answer I can give you an
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
answer in terms of
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the county the number of Republicans
 
04:59:24.650 --> 04:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
that have been a republic a commission
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was one from Dover
 
04:59:29.810 --> 04:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
years ago but other than that for
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
decades that there's been one
 
04:59:34.368 --> 04:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
but it's specifically to that I no I
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:41.208 --> 04:59:41.218 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:59:41.218 --> 04:59:45.250 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
Gallagher

04:59:45.250 --> 04:59:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.310 --> 04:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.320 --> 04:59:56.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:56.638 --> 04:59:58.850 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:59:58.850 --> 04:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just looking at the map and um
 
05:00:07.610 --> 05:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh I'm noticing it gets
 
05:00:11.930 --> 05:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
a very the second district gets very
 
05:00:17.690 --> 05:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
narrow between the point of Madbury and
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the border with Rockingham County I'm
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could tell us what
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the distance is there at its
 
05:00:27.110 --> 05:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
narrowest point
 
05:00:30.410 --> 05:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
no I don't know the actual distance alls
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
I do know is they are contiguous and no
 
05:00:38.930 --> 05:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
not different than uh some of the the
 
05:00:43.490 --> 05:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
maps uh I'd have to think back about the
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
House of Representative Maps I'm I'm not
 
05:00:52.030 --> 05:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
sure but the the rules for
 
05:00:55.128 --> 05:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
redistricting or districting in this
 
05:00:58.730 --> 05:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
case is that the towns and or the wards
 
05:01:01.070 --> 05:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
have to be contiguous
 
05:01:01.080 --> 05:01:03.590 align:start position:0%
have to be contiguous
look

05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
look
 
05:01:03.600 --> 05:01:06.948 align:start position:0%
look
yes

05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
okay so on the topic of contiguity uh do
 
05:01:12.890 --> 05:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
you believe that point contiguity
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
satisfies the contiguity Criterion
 
05:01:19.490 --> 05:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
not only do I believe that but the uh
 
05:01:21.890 --> 05:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
the district the Supreme Court of New
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has said that is the case
 
05:01:24.770 --> 05:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
matter of fact
 
05:01:28.208 --> 05:01:28.218 align:start position:0%
um that was a subject of the Manchester
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
2003 redistricting case there was a
 
05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
point in Stratford County where that
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
happened that was between Stratford and
 
05:01:38.208 --> 05:01:38.218 align:start position:0%
New Durham that also occurs in the
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
latest redistricting map in 20 that we
 
05:01:45.310 --> 05:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
passed last year in this house the
 
05:01:48.530 --> 05:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
map that was suggested by the Democrats
 
05:01:50.690 --> 05:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
on our redistricting Committee in
 
05:01:52.730 --> 05:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County in fact did that exact
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
same thing and yet so long long-winded
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
answer to your question but yeah that
 
05:02:00.530 --> 05:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
has been found uh to be uh
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay in the U.S Supreme Court
 
05:02:06.170 --> 05:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh in the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:02:08.100 --> 05:02:10.010 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
majority

05:02:10.010 --> 05:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
majority
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I know in in my
 
05:02:15.770 --> 05:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
history on this uh in this committee
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
we've had at least one representative
 
05:02:20.090 --> 05:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
has tried to find consistency among the
 
05:02:21.650 --> 05:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
counties for any number of different
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
issues and I'll apologize first for not
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
doing the homework that I should have
 
05:02:27.530 --> 05:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
done and putting you on the spot for
 
05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
this but
 
05:02:32.510 --> 05:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
why in the current language is it except
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
for Stratford County that you do it this
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
way do we have the history of of why I
 
05:02:41.810 --> 05:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
actually I didn't know but I I believe
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
you will hear I I think at one time uh
 
05:02:47.448 --> 05:02:47.458 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who's going to test
 
05:02:49.128 --> 05:02:49.138 align:start position:0%
another rep who's going to testify today
 
05:02:50.628 --> 05:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
I think he may actually have the answer
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
for that I believe this the the history
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
is at one time it might have been all
 
05:02:59.868 --> 05:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
counties were elected at large and over
 
05:03:01.490 --> 05:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
the years
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
we've been I believe he will he'll back
 
05:03:06.910 --> 05:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
me up on this I think it's been since
 
05:03:10.670 --> 05:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
1979. we have been the only County like
 
05:03:10.680 --> 05:03:11.510 align:start position:0%
1979. we have been the only County like
this

05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:03:12.770 --> 05:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
05:03:16.368 --> 05:03:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.288 --> 05:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Representatives
 
05:03:18.298 --> 05:03:20.510 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Representatives
Davis

05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
05:03:25.850 --> 05:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
I get how there are more Democrats than
 
05:03:28.740 --> 05:03:30.170 align:start position:0%
I get how there are more Democrats than
Republicans

05:03:30.170 --> 05:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
Republicans
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these places
 
05:03:35.570 --> 05:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
I don't get how that's not fair I mean
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it your job as
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
Republicans to convert Democrats to
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
Republicans and our job to do vice versa
 
05:03:46.910 --> 05:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
I mean how how is it not fair that the
 
05:03:46.920 --> 05:03:48.890 align:start position:0%
I mean how how is it not fair that the
populations

05:03:48.890 --> 05:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
populations
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
just happen to be this way that's
 
05:03:51.840 --> 05:03:55.208 align:start position:0%
just happen to be this way that's
politics

05:03:55.208 --> 05:03:55.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.670 --> 05:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
no well yes and no I mean if you want to
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
talk about by the district I would agree
 
05:04:03.890 --> 05:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
with you absolutely but when you talk
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
about a county who elects at large in a
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
county that's 60 40. to me that's
 
05:04:13.730 --> 05:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
anything but fair that's the actually
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
the opposite of the the term fair when
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
every other County does it
 
05:04:22.490 --> 05:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
as you just said you know here's your
 
05:04:24.050 --> 05:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
district there are Republicans and
 
05:04:25.970 --> 05:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
Democrats that live in it here's a
 
05:04:28.030 --> 05:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
district Republicans and Democrats live
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
in it
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
and we ended up for our state reps I
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
keep saying at 201 to 197.
 
05:04:38.810 --> 05:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
this is a case and again I if you went
 
05:04:40.850 --> 05:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
back and looked at the commissioner's
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
results and all the other counties I
 
05:04:44.570 --> 05:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
don't know what the results was because
 
05:04:46.610 --> 05:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a it wasn't a focus of mine
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
but I think you would find you wouldn't
 
05:04:55.368 --> 05:04:55.378 align:start position:0%
find an argument from me on what you
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
just said the argument in this for
 
05:05:02.570 --> 05:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
fairness is the county we do it as a
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
whole at large like no other County and
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
because the county as a whole without
 
05:05:15.070 --> 05:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
districts is 60 40 we will not have any
 
05:05:17.270 --> 05:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
Republican representation in the
 
05:05:17.280 --> 05:05:18.530 align:start position:0%
Republican representation in the
commissioners

05:05:18.530 --> 05:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
05:05:18.540 --> 05:05:21.170 align:start position:0%
commissioners
yes

05:05:21.170 --> 05:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:05:23.090 --> 05:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
taking this ball
 
05:05:28.070 --> 05:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying why not just change it to
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
not at large I I didn't hear you the
 
05:05:33.410 --> 05:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
question why not just change the
 
05:05:36.050 --> 05:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
elections to not be at large wouldn't
 
05:05:39.708 --> 05:05:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.050 --> 05:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
yes and the only way to do that is to
 
05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
have districts thank you
 
05:05:44.520 --> 05:05:46.670 align:start position:0%
have districts thank you
yes

05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:05:49.310 --> 05:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
the chair rep the chair recognizes
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
05:05:52.670 --> 05:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:52.680 --> 05:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:05:55.670 --> 05:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:55.680 --> 05:05:57.170 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:05:57.170 --> 05:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
is there so there's in the Constitution
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
there is some requirement to try and get
 
05:06:06.350 --> 05:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
um kind of as small as like each town is
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
able to have their own you know State
 
05:06:11.090 --> 05:06:11.100 align:start position:0%
reps and stuff like that is there no
 
05:06:14.510 --> 05:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
requirement uh for a county that it try
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
and be as as compact as possible and not
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
do what you know uh you know because
 
05:06:23.330 --> 05:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
there's it wouldn't be allowed right now
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
to elect
 
05:06:28.628 --> 05:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
the entire County delegation at large
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
right so is there's no such requirement
 
05:06:36.650 --> 05:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
at the county level to be have a a
 
05:06:39.110 --> 05:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
smaller uh District
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
I know you were you were a little bit
 
05:06:46.850 --> 05:06:46.860 align:start position:0%
involved with the the the uh State Rep
 
05:06:46.860 --> 05:06:48.050 align:start position:0%
involved with the the the uh State Rep
so

05:06:48.050 --> 05:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:55.368 --> 05:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
38 Representatives into Stratford County
 
05:06:58.430 --> 05:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
that's a lot more difficult to do to
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
make the numbers work and with districts
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
than it is
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
to come up with three representatives
 
05:07:07.850 --> 05:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
does that make sense so no that although
 
05:07:10.208 --> 05:07:10.218 align:start position:0%
there are that the main U.S
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional rule of
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know that plus plus or minus five
 
05:07:17.448 --> 05:07:17.458 align:start position:0%
percent ten percent is firm and if you
 
05:07:20.930 --> 05:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
go over it you you always try to get
 
05:07:20.940 --> 05:07:22.788 align:start position:0%
go over it you you always try to get
your

05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:07:25.128 --> 05:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
um deviation down as low as possible
 
05:07:28.010 --> 05:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
because that tells you that the counties
 
05:07:31.250 --> 05:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
are balanced as close to pot uh equal
 
05:07:34.730 --> 05:07:34.740 align:start position:0%
population as possible but the the rules
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:07:39.170 --> 05:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
let's just say there when we when we
 
05:07:41.090 --> 05:07:41.100 align:start position:0%
started redistricting we started with a
 
05:07:43.368 --> 05:07:43.378 align:start position:0%
book that was this big by this big by
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
that thick with all the
 
05:07:46.200 --> 05:07:47.270 align:start position:0%
that thick with all the
um

05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
legal rulings in the United States plus
 
05:07:52.610 --> 05:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
we had things for New Hampshire
 
05:07:56.570 --> 05:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
the majority of them were U.S House reps
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
and state reps because those are the
 
05:08:00.770 --> 05:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
places where you're trying to compact
 
05:08:04.250 --> 05:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
things into smaller this year I don't
 
05:08:06.288 --> 05:08:06.298 align:start position:0%
even know if I remember seeing
 
05:08:09.890 --> 05:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
a a case on commissioners
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:16.250 --> 05:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
next the chair recognizes representative
 
05:08:16.260 --> 05:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
next the chair recognizes representative
Cahill

05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
Cahill
 
05:08:18.770 --> 05:08:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:08:20.810 --> 05:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
taking a second question
 
05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
do you think it would be fair if say the
 
05:08:26.810 --> 05:08:26.820 align:start position:0%
state representative from Dover was
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
really representing Milton and never
 
05:08:31.010 --> 05:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
giving them people of Milton a voice
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
could you say that one again do you
 
05:08:35.810 --> 05:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
think it would be fair if if
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
the representatives say representing
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
Dover w-3 ward 3
 
05:08:44.930 --> 05:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
was was representing Milton at Large
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and that's the purpose of
 
05:08:47.520 --> 05:08:48.650 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and that's the purpose of
this

05:08:48.650 --> 05:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:55.128 --> 05:08:55.138 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:08:55.138 --> 05:08:56.628 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
mangaputi

05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
mangaputi
 
05:08:58.730 --> 05:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and this is a
 
05:09:00.590 --> 05:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up to my question thank you for
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing me
 
05:09:02.400 --> 05:09:03.230 align:start position:0%
recognizing me
um

05:09:03.230 --> 05:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:05.090 --> 05:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
you have
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
voters as Democrats and Republicans in
 
05:09:16.250 --> 05:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.610 --> 05:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
part of Republican Democrat and majority
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
of the middle is Undeclared you mean to
 
05:09:26.570 --> 05:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
tell me that Stafford County has no
 
05:09:29.570 --> 05:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
Undeclared voters
 
05:09:33.050 --> 05:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if you when I
 
05:09:36.170 --> 05:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
was testifying I specified that these
 
05:09:38.570 --> 05:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
numbers were the voting results from
 
05:09:43.550 --> 05:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
2022 elections so I don't know
 
05:09:46.310 --> 05:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
how many of the R's or D's in any of
 
05:09:47.570 --> 05:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
those numbers I gave you are
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
Independence but that's irrelevant these
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
were the actual results of
 
05:09:58.610 --> 05:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
the election of 2022. I put those there
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
for you to see so you could see what the
 
05:10:07.010 --> 05:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
result of this map would have produced
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
can I have a follow-up mine yes you may
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so going this yes you cannot
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
stay Undeclared when you vote you can't
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
vote as an Undeclared I get it and this
 
05:10:23.810 --> 05:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
is the voting record for 2022 but if
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
you're changing the map to elect
 
05:10:31.550 --> 05:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
of a commissioner by District
 
05:10:35.330 --> 05:10:35.340 align:start position:0%
and trying to base it on the voting
 
05:10:38.868 --> 05:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
records of 21 election
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
you're not taking the demographics of
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
the voters
 
05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
in a static non-election so how do you
 
05:10:50.208 --> 05:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
predict it might change next 2024 there
 
05:10:52.730 --> 05:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
might be more Republican on Undeclared
 
05:10:56.270 --> 05:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
voting as Republican but to to be clear
 
05:10:56.280 --> 05:10:58.910 align:start position:0%
voting as Republican but to to be clear
when

05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:11:02.208 --> 05:11:02.218 align:start position:0%
when we drew or when I
 
05:11:06.110 --> 05:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
Drew these commissioner's map
 
05:11:09.170 --> 05:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
I didn't take into account
 
05:11:12.110 --> 05:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the results that I showed you on the
 
05:11:13.490 --> 05:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
bottom of that right hand side of the
 
05:11:16.490 --> 05:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
page I drew the district and then I said
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay one of the things they're going to
 
05:11:21.430 --> 05:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
wonder when I present this bill is
 
05:11:23.708 --> 05:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
how what would have been the results
 
05:11:27.170 --> 05:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
coming out of the last election if this
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
map would have been
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
in place if we would have been electing
 
05:11:31.560 --> 05:11:33.410 align:start position:0%
in place if we would have been electing
commissioners

05:11:33.410 --> 05:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
05:11:35.930 --> 05:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
by districts that's all those numbers do
 
05:11:39.970 --> 05:11:39.980 align:start position:0%
I I'm not saying how many Democratic
 
05:11:42.410 --> 05:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
democrat or republican or independent
 
05:11:45.288 --> 05:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
voters there are and and that that's not
 
05:11:47.868 --> 05:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
what I did I simply took the map I drew
 
05:11:49.970 --> 05:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
and said here's what it would have come
 
05:11:51.530 --> 05:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
out of that you would have had one
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
Republican who barely would have carried
 
05:11:56.930 --> 05:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
and you would have had two Democrat
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that's all it is that's
 
05:12:01.010 --> 05:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
all those numbers are
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
05:12:04.740 --> 05:12:08.990 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
Gilman

05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:12:13.250 --> 05:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
question this goes along the lines of
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
why not just do this for All Counties
 
05:12:19.448 --> 05:12:19.458 align:start position:0%
and I agree that each County needs to be
 
05:12:22.550 --> 05:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
delineated by which town they rep are
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
represented by Which counties being
 
05:12:28.490 --> 05:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
represented separately but the first
 
05:12:31.788 --> 05:12:31.798 align:start position:0%
half of the bill could be changed to All
 
05:12:34.490 --> 05:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
Counties because there's only two this
 
05:12:37.128 --> 05:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
is uh 653 colon one
 
05:12:41.570 --> 05:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
comma 9 Roman numerals 6c
 
05:12:41.580 --> 05:12:42.530 align:start position:0%
comma 9 Roman numerals 6c
um

05:12:42.530 --> 05:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
that can be changed to All Counties
 
05:12:47.090 --> 05:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
because right now only Carol and
 
05:12:49.368 --> 05:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
Sullivan if we make this change only
 
05:12:51.050 --> 05:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
Carol and Sullivan would be the ones
 
05:12:54.128 --> 05:12:54.138 align:start position:0%
that are elected at Large
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
no there's only one County right now
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:04.368 --> 05:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
because we because we in 2020 the the
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
redistricting we drew All Counties with
 
05:13:07.798 --> 05:13:09.288 align:start position:0%
redistricting we drew All Counties with
commissioners

05:13:09.288 --> 05:13:09.298 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
05:13:13.250 --> 05:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
well right now it says what was the what
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
was the RSA 6 6 53 colon one elected for
 
05:13:20.030 --> 05:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
two-year terms
 
05:13:22.788 --> 05:13:22.798 align:start position:0%
and it says Carroll County one
 
05:13:24.590 --> 05:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
County Commissioner from each County
 
05:13:27.050 --> 05:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioner District by all voters of
 
05:13:29.750 --> 05:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying I'd have I'd have to
 
05:13:34.128 --> 05:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
go back and look at that particular one
 
05:13:36.708 --> 05:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
okay look at that in Sullivan
 
05:13:38.930 --> 05:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:13:38.940 --> 05:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
Gallagher

05:13:43.430 --> 05:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
um yeah so
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
um going so kind of uh continuing on the
 
05:13:53.750 --> 05:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
um theme of how count different counties
 
05:13:56.570 --> 05:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
do things differently
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
so in Merrimack County
 
05:14:03.948 --> 05:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
um the majority of our voters are
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
Democrats except um
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
and yet our accounting Commissioners the
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
way our districts are drawn um we have
 
05:14:17.030 --> 05:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
two Republican County Commissioners and
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
one Democratic County Commissioner so
 
05:14:23.090 --> 05:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
would you say that that meets your
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
Criterion of fairness between the
 
05:14:26.400 --> 05:14:27.770 align:start position:0%
Criterion of fairness between the
parties

05:14:27.770 --> 05:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
parties
 
05:14:30.410 --> 05:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
I what I would say to that is I I don't
 
05:14:32.810 --> 05:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with your particular
 
05:14:36.170 --> 05:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
County but if it's if it has three
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
districts I would say yes that's fair
 
05:14:42.288 --> 05:14:42.298 align:start position:0%
what I would say was not fair
 
05:14:44.990 --> 05:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
is if you've got two Republicans and one
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
Democrat uh Commissioners in your County
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
right now my guess would be is if that
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
County elected their Commissioners at
 
05:14:56.810 --> 05:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
large in other words you your entire
 
05:14:58.850 --> 05:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
County elected
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
the three Commissioners like Stratford
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
does you'd have three Republican
 
05:15:02.878 --> 05:15:07.970 align:start position:0%
does you'd have three Republican
commissioners

05:15:07.970 --> 05:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:09.770 --> 05:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair would like to
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
remind committee members that if you
 
05:15:12.948 --> 05:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
would like to be acknowledged to speak
 
05:15:16.070 --> 05:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand and try to obtain
 
05:15:19.310 --> 05:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
my eye contact I do scan the committee
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
table from left to right and I try to
 
05:15:24.890 --> 05:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
alternate and if you don't have your
 
05:15:27.410 --> 05:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
hand raised and I don't see it then I do
 
05:15:30.050 --> 05:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
not know that you would like to speak so
 
05:15:33.770 --> 05:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
I did get some eye contact from
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Tatro earlier so the
 
05:15:39.470 --> 05:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Tatro
 
05:15:39.480 --> 05:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Tatro
first

05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:44.810 --> 05:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:15:44.820 --> 05:15:46.910 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
I

05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:15:49.610 --> 05:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm looking at this rather
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.330 --> 05:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
you've got the county of Stratford
 
05:15:59.330 --> 05:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
everybody voted
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
for commissioners
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
and the Democrats came out on top
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
why would you try to negate
 
05:16:12.050 --> 05:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
what the what the voters
 
05:16:15.770 --> 05:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
have voted I mean how can you
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
we are not trying to negate what
 
05:16:20.810 --> 05:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
happened in 2022 what we're trying to do
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
is going forward
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.050 --> 05:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
our County elect Commissioners based on
 
05:16:33.830 --> 05:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
districts like every other County
 
05:16:36.128 --> 05:16:36.138 align:start position:0%
and by doing that you are not
 
05:16:38.690 --> 05:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising 40 percent of our
 
05:16:38.700 --> 05:16:39.948 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising 40 percent of our
counties

05:16:39.948 --> 05:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
counties
 
05:16:39.958 --> 05:16:43.610 align:start position:0%
counties
citizens

05:16:43.610 --> 05:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:45.890 --> 05:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
by when you only have 40 percent
 
05:16:50.930 --> 05:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.690 --> 05:16:53.700 align:start position:0%
kind of to Representatives Gallagher's
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
question in Reverse if it's a 60 40
 
05:16:59.208 --> 05:16:59.218 align:start position:0%
split and you your county elects three
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
individuals by the county
 
05:17:04.610 --> 05:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
and it's 60 40 you're going to end up
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
with whatever that 60 percent is whether
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
it's Democrats or Republicans that's
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
what happens in Stratford County it's
 
05:17:14.448 --> 05:17:14.458 align:start position:0%
the only County where we do it so what
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm what this bill would do is bring our
 
05:17:18.830 --> 05:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
County in line with all the other
 
05:17:18.840 --> 05:17:20.390 align:start position:0%
County in line with all the other
accountants

05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
accountants
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:17:25.788 --> 05:17:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:25.798 --> 05:17:28.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
I

05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.490 --> 05:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.410 --> 05:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
like you're trying to move things around
 
05:17:39.050 --> 05:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
so that you end up so the Republicans
 
05:17:40.850 --> 05:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
come out on top
 
05:17:44.570 --> 05:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
no what it would do is it would
 
05:17:44.580 --> 05:17:45.890 align:start position:0%
no what it would do is it would
create

05:17:45.890 --> 05:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
create
 
05:17:49.970 --> 05:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
a county with two Democrat commissioners
 
05:17:49.980 --> 05:17:51.430 align:start position:0%
a county with two Democrat commissioners
and

05:17:51.430 --> 05:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:54.530 --> 05:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
one Republican commissioner instead of
 
05:17:54.540 --> 05:17:55.550 align:start position:0%
one Republican commissioner instead of
three

05:17:55.550 --> 05:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:17:58.368 --> 05:17:58.378 align:start position:0%
and if if that's what the voters voted
 
05:18:01.368 --> 05:18:01.378 align:start position:0%
why isn't that
 
05:18:01.378 --> 05:18:07.730 align:start position:0%
why isn't that
good

05:18:07.730 --> 05:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:09.708 --> 05:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:18:09.718 --> 05:18:15.708 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative

05:18:15.708 --> 05:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:17.990 --> 05:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
am I to understand that you think a
 
05:18:20.330 --> 05:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
republican never voted for a Democratic
 
05:18:22.490 --> 05:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
candidate in the
 
05:18:24.890 --> 05:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
County of Stratford in the state of New
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the last 50 years
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative true 11 I would have no
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
idea if that's ever happened
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up Madam chair
 
05:18:37.368 --> 05:18:37.378 align:start position:0%
yes you may follow up
 
05:18:46.368 --> 05:18:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:48.890 --> 05:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
sister Republican will automatically
 
05:18:51.170 --> 05:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
vote for another person who is running
 
05:18:55.250 --> 05:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
on the Republican ticket versus making
 
05:18:57.230 --> 05:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
their own choice
 
05:19:00.050 --> 05:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
as a republican to vote for the person
 
05:19:02.208 --> 05:19:02.218 align:start position:0%
they think is best for the job whether
 
05:19:05.810 --> 05:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
they be a Democrat or a Republican
 
05:19:08.090 --> 05:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
I am not
 
05:19:08.100 --> 05:19:08.990 align:start position:0%
I am not
um

05:19:08.990 --> 05:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:11.628 --> 05:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
making those hypothetical hypothetical
 
05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
assumptions my assumptions are strictly
 
05:19:18.650 --> 05:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
based on the data that's all it is well
 
05:19:21.110 --> 05:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right I disagree with you
 
05:19:23.090 --> 05:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%

05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking one more question which I
 
05:19:29.208 --> 05:19:29.218 align:start position:0%
think will be a quick and easy one on on
 
05:19:31.730 --> 05:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
the page with the data yes sir and on
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
the lower right where it's County Wide
 
05:19:36.288 --> 05:19:36.298 align:start position:0%
correct do I understand correctly that
 
05:19:39.410 --> 05:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
is that is as is no districts drawn
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
that's what the total numbers are were
 
05:19:46.490 --> 05:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
in 2022 correct and Madam chair one
 
05:19:48.350 --> 05:19:48.360 align:start position:0%

or can you tell me where I can get
history

05:19:54.410 --> 05:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
history

05:20:15.110 --> 05:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:20:16.610 --> 05:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:20:18.650 --> 05:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
05:20:21.530 --> 05:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
the whole objective
 
05:20:21.540 --> 05:20:23.510 align:start position:0%
the whole objective
of

05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:20:23.520 --> 05:20:25.330 align:start position:0%
of
non

05:20:25.330 --> 05:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
non
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
at large districts
 
05:20:30.948 --> 05:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
is to make people
 
05:20:34.250 --> 05:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
feel that they have a franchise that
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
they're not disenfranchised and let me
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
expand on that a minute there are Parts
 
05:20:42.368 --> 05:20:42.378 align:start position:0%
in this country where we have at large
 
05:20:45.430 --> 05:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
elections by states
 
05:20:49.310 --> 05:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
where if you're of the non-majority
 
05:20:52.128 --> 05:20:52.138 align:start position:0%
party you have a feeling that your vote
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't count
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
do you see what I'm saying
 
05:21:00.050 --> 05:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
I understand and that was part of one of
 
05:21:02.750 --> 05:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
the I I think I've used that actual word
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
and part of my testimony about 40
 
05:21:07.868 --> 05:21:07.878 align:start position:0%
percent or whatever the number is being
 
05:21:10.368 --> 05:21:10.378 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised in our County in terms
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
of being able to elect uh a commissioner
 
05:21:16.010 --> 05:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
05:21:18.350 --> 05:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions from the
 
05:21:20.570 --> 05:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
committee members for the prime sponsor
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%

Davis
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
I think this will be a quick one
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you used you used the
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
phrase saddled with a Democrat
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner can you enlarge upon that
 
05:21:40.850 --> 05:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
um our County other than like I said
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
other than
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
I think one term one individual that I
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
can think of in the last few decades has
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
been a republican so yeah we have had
 
05:21:58.070 --> 05:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
I I think you'll get a flavor maybe for
 
05:22:00.530 --> 05:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
that response um
 
05:22:02.570 --> 05:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
there will be other individuals who will
 
05:22:04.490 --> 05:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
be testifying today and they may might
 
05:22:10.128 --> 05:22:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for introducing
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%

05:22:38.990 --> 05:22:39.000 align:start position:0%

so next different different microphone
 
05:22:47.810 --> 05:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
next the chair would like to acknowledge
 
05:22:50.090 --> 05:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
um representative Michael Granger to
 
05:22:50.100 --> 05:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
um representative Michael Granger to
testify

05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
05:23:06.770 --> 05:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee my name is representative
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
Michael Granger I represent Stratford
 
05:23:10.070 --> 05:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
District Two that includes Rochester
 
05:23:13.010 --> 05:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
Ward 5 Milton and Milton Mills it's a
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
small one we've got to include Milton
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mills this bill would separate Stratford
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
County into three separate districts uh
 
05:23:19.550 --> 05:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
you may be wondering why this is
 
05:23:19.560 --> 05:23:20.570 align:start position:0%
you may be wondering why this is
necessary

05:23:20.570 --> 05:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:23:22.730 --> 05:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
there are several reasons but the most
 
05:23:25.190 --> 05:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
important by far is the simple reality
 
05:23:26.448 --> 05:23:26.458 align:start position:0%
that the County Commission routinely
 
05:23:29.090 --> 05:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
ignores people in the towns people in
 
05:23:30.288 --> 05:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
the rural parts of Stratford County
 
05:23:32.090 --> 05:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
should not be treated as second-class
 
05:23:34.010 --> 05:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
voters and this legislation would fix
 
05:23:34.020 --> 05:23:35.150 align:start position:0%
voters and this legislation would fix
that

05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:37.250 --> 05:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
for example we had a recent Stratford
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
County delegation meeting we heard a
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
brief overview of the proposed budget
 
05:23:42.410 --> 05:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
from the County Commissioners they
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that all tax increases would
 
05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
be below that of Rochester Somersworth
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
and dover's respective tax caps
 
05:23:50.930 --> 05:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
when it was pointed out that Milton and
 
05:23:52.730 --> 05:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
Middleton both have tax caps of their
 
05:23:56.090 --> 05:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
own the response was and I quote oh I
 
05:23:57.230 --> 05:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
didn't know that
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
end quote no further questions on the
 
05:24:01.850 --> 05:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
matter were asked no inquiry into what
 
05:24:04.128 --> 05:24:04.138 align:start position:0%
the tax cap in those towns even was just
 
05:24:06.050 --> 05:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
a simple statement followed by a
 
05:24:07.730 --> 05:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
continuation of what was apparently much
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
more important business
 
05:24:11.628 --> 05:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
this isn't a one-off event it is very
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
clear to the people in my district as
 
05:24:15.050 --> 05:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
well as among those who are nearby towns
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
that the county officials down south in
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
Dover don't even consider them at all
 
05:24:20.810 --> 05:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
when it comes to decision making Dover
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
Rochester and Somersworth have priority
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere else is a tertiary thought I
 
05:24:26.810 --> 05:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
have friends in the smaller towns down
 
05:24:28.490 --> 05:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
south as well places like Barrington and
 
05:24:30.110 --> 05:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
Farmington and Madbury and they report
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
the same thing
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing isn't new it isn't
 
05:24:36.288 --> 05:24:36.298 align:start position:0%
radical it is precedented in every other
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
County in New Hampshire
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
I can get to your history questions as
 
05:24:42.890 --> 05:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
well since 1979 it has only been
 
05:24:45.050 --> 05:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
Stratford County that has had at-large
 
05:24:46.368 --> 05:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
opponents to this might point out that
 
05:24:49.730 --> 05:24:49.740 align:start position:0%
Stratford county is the smallest county
 
05:24:52.010 --> 05:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire this may be true but
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
Belknap County which is a beautiful area
 
05:24:55.970 --> 05:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
with wonderful people has only about 40
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
more square miles of land area and a
 
05:25:00.050 --> 05:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
population of sixty three thousand seven
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
hundred and five that's less than half
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
the population of Stratford County and
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
it gets to have three separate districts
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
the gorgeous and remote kowas county has
 
05:25:10.030 --> 05:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
a population of 31
 
05:25:12.350 --> 05:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
268. there's about a quarter of the
 
05:25:14.030 --> 05:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
population of Stratford County but it
 
05:25:16.250 --> 05:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
has three districts
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's been over 40 years since Belknap
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
co-as and every other County decided
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
that the problems that are inherent in
 
05:25:24.230 --> 05:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
having at large County Commissioners
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
were Troublesome enough to justify
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to fix it we've been dealing
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
with the same problems every other
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
County faced and it's high time we
 
05:25:32.990 --> 05:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
finally did the same thing for Stratford
 
05:25:33.000 --> 05:25:33.948 align:start position:0%
finally did the same thing for Stratford
County

05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
County
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote OTP on HB 270 thank
 
05:25:38.810 --> 05:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
you for your time I'd like to thank Mila
 
05:25:40.128 --> 05:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
Patton and the legislative services for
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
helping with research on this and I am
 
05:25:45.610 --> 05:25:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:48.890 --> 05:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do we have any
 
05:25:50.750 --> 05:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative mandraputi thank you
 
05:25:55.128 --> 05:25:55.138 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative for
 
05:25:58.250 --> 05:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
taking my question so Stafford County is
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
the only County that's electing
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at Large
 
05:26:06.050 --> 05:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
and uh you just said and there are two
 
05:26:08.868 --> 05:26:08.878 align:start position:0%
other counties from our quick research
 
05:26:11.930 --> 05:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
here says that there's two other that is
 
05:26:13.550 --> 05:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
doing at Large
 
05:26:13.560 --> 05:26:15.470 align:start position:0%
doing at Large
and

05:26:15.470 --> 05:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:17.570 --> 05:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
uh that's so the two counties that I
 
05:26:18.890 --> 05:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned I brought up for two reasons
 
05:26:20.690 --> 05:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
uh Belknap County I brought up because
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
it is in similar size to Stratford
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
County it's a little bit larger but a
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
lot of that is Lake and uh you know it
 
05:26:29.090 --> 05:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
it is larger but it's only if you
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
actually only count land area it's only
 
05:26:33.170 --> 05:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
40 square miles larger so it's basically
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
the same size in regards to livable area
 
05:26:37.490 --> 05:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and this and it also has half the
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
population I brought up koas County
 
05:26:41.448 --> 05:26:41.458 align:start position:0%
because koas county has as far as I know
 
05:26:43.788 --> 05:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
the lowest population and it has three
 
05:26:45.770 --> 05:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
uh three districts so both of those
 
05:26:46.970 --> 05:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
counties that I mentioned they have
 
05:26:48.590 --> 05:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
District uh voting for County
 
05:26:51.890 --> 05:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
Commissioners uh follow Madame chair I
 
05:26:54.170 --> 05:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
didn't get to my question ah yes you may
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so would it be considered Fair
 
05:27:01.850 --> 05:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
after its District three districts in
 
05:27:04.610 --> 05:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
Stratford County and yet voters elected
 
05:27:06.650 --> 05:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
three Democrats
 
05:27:09.170 --> 05:27:09.180 align:start position:0%
as Commissioners would it be considered
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
fair at that time I if if we broke it
 
05:27:15.170 --> 05:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
into district and the voters chose three
 
05:27:17.930 --> 05:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
Democrats then hey that's how that's
 
05:27:23.150 --> 05:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.410 --> 05:27:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:27:31.670 --> 05:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony
 
05:27:33.770 --> 05:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
um I do I it it wasn't part of my
 
05:27:35.690 --> 05:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I skipped it but uh
 
05:27:37.250 --> 05:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
I do you mind me answering some
 
05:27:40.670 --> 05:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
do you have that written
 
05:27:44.690 --> 05:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
um I have I have some revised statutes
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
from uh previous years if anyone is
 
05:27:47.930 --> 05:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
interested in it um if we don't want to
 
05:27:49.610 --> 05:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
take committee time on it I can provide
 
05:27:53.930 --> 05:27:53.940 align:start position:0%

so next the chair would like to
 
05:28:02.868 --> 05:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Cliff Newton
 
05:28:05.510 --> 05:28:05.520 align:start position:0%

in three cities
uh

05:28:59.090 --> 05:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:01.970 --> 05:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
the approximate tax rate proportion
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
is the the three cities and Durham pay
 
05:29:09.170 --> 05:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
22.7 million towards the tax bill for
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
the Stratford County
 
05:29:14.030 --> 05:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
and the other nine towns pay 11 and a
 
05:29:17.208 --> 05:29:17.218 align:start position:0%
half million so these four pay
 
05:29:20.150 --> 05:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh two-thirds and the other nine pay
 
05:29:20.160 --> 05:29:22.310 align:start position:0%
uh two-thirds and the other nine pay
one-third

05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
one-third
 
05:29:25.070 --> 05:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
how did how that matters and where the
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
fairness comes in because this is at
 
05:29:28.080 --> 05:29:28.930 align:start position:0%
fairness comes in because this is at
Large

05:29:28.930 --> 05:29:28.940 align:start position:0%
Large
 
05:29:32.930 --> 05:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
there are uh the Dover Somersworth in
 
05:29:36.410 --> 05:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
Durham just those three two cities in
 
05:29:39.708 --> 05:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
one town out of the 13
 
05:29:42.368 --> 05:29:42.378 align:start position:0%
gave one party
 
05:29:46.190 --> 05:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
eight thousand nine hundred and seventy
 
05:29:46.200 --> 05:29:47.570 align:start position:0%
eight thousand nine hundred and seventy
seven

05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
seven
 
05:29:51.110 --> 05:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
more votes than the other party that's
 
05:29:54.650 --> 05:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
two town to one town and two cities gave
 
05:29:58.430 --> 05:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
them a cushion of nine thousand votes
 
05:30:01.250 --> 05:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
now you add the city of Rochester to
 
05:30:01.260 --> 05:30:02.330 align:start position:0%
now you add the city of Rochester to
that

05:30:02.330 --> 05:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
in Rochester the old the question from
 
05:30:09.170 --> 05:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
Rochester was 48 votes a 48 volt
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
difference between one party and the
 
05:30:13.550 --> 05:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
other so what you've got is you've got
 
05:30:17.448 --> 05:30:17.458 align:start position:0%
two cities in a town that are giving one
 
05:30:21.410 --> 05:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
Party 9 000 votes cushion
 
05:30:25.910 --> 05:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
in this County now you go to uh the
 
05:30:28.490 --> 05:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
other towns the nine other towns and
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
they all matter because they're all part
 
05:30:31.850 --> 05:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
of the county
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
you take the vote difference from one
 
05:30:36.470 --> 05:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
part of the other or nine other towns
 
05:30:40.910 --> 05:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a 60 volt difference
 
05:30:44.570 --> 05:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
now that's mind-boggling what you've got
 
05:30:46.930 --> 05:30:46.940 align:start position:0%
is you've got two cities in a town
 
05:30:51.288 --> 05:30:51.298 align:start position:0%
providing nine thousand volt cushion to
 
05:30:53.208 --> 05:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
who gets elected and the other towns
 
05:30:55.670 --> 05:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's less than 100 volts
 
05:30:58.610 --> 05:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
there is your unfairness
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
and there is why they run at large and
 
05:31:04.250 --> 05:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
these people that run the commissioners
 
05:31:07.490 --> 05:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
of the executive committee where the uh
 
05:31:11.570 --> 05:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee and there's
 
05:31:13.670 --> 05:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
three executive committee members per
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
each County
 
05:31:18.530 --> 05:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
so that is the unfairness there so if
 
05:31:20.690 --> 05:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
you're exact if you're a council a
 
05:31:23.270 --> 05:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner and you know where your
 
05:31:26.030 --> 05:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
bread is buttered with 9 000 votes
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
cushion who are you going to cater to
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
and that's what's happening here and I'm
 
05:31:33.890 --> 05:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
going to tell you what I've seen and
 
05:31:35.868 --> 05:31:35.878 align:start position:0%
this is what I've Vision what I've seen
 
05:31:37.368 --> 05:31:37.378 align:start position:0%
and what I know
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I know that the other surrounding
 
05:31:42.610 --> 05:31:42.620 align:start position:0%
towns which I'm not one of I'm Rochester
 
05:31:45.948 --> 05:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
being treated very badly and ignored and
 
05:31:48.470 --> 05:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a couple examples
 
05:31:51.650 --> 05:31:51.660 align:start position:0%
one of the example is there's a what was
 
05:31:54.350 --> 05:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
brought forward was a three-legged stool
 
05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
and that was going to bring homeless
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
shelter to the city to the county it was
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to bring a new nursing home to the
 
05:32:04.970 --> 05:32:04.980 align:start position:0%
county and it was going to bring a solar
 
05:32:07.850 --> 05:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
farm to the county now
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
the homeless shelter was discussed with
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
Somersworth with Rochester and with
 
05:32:13.680 --> 05:32:15.050 align:start position:0%
Somersworth with Rochester and with
Dover

05:32:15.050 --> 05:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
Dover
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
I don't believe any other County any of
 
05:32:20.150 --> 05:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
the towns the Commissioners went to
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
those towns and talked to them about
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
this but there is a commissioner here
 
05:32:25.970 --> 05:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
and if you want to ask him because I've
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
been trying to find out you want to ask
 
05:32:31.250 --> 05:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
him what towns they've been to and what
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
dates of those meetings so I can
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
research it myself when they went to
 
05:32:38.690 --> 05:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
every town and discussed that now
 
05:32:40.730 --> 05:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
they again they went to Rochester
 
05:32:43.970 --> 05:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
Somersworth and Dover now when they
 
05:32:46.910 --> 05:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
talked about the new nursing home the
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
first proposal was 170 million dollars
 
05:32:54.110 --> 05:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
and that had to be born that had to be
 
05:32:56.750 --> 05:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
bonded we had to have a public hearing
 
05:33:00.170 --> 05:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
for that bonding well guess what
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
one of the towns the state law says 21A
 
05:33:05.690 --> 05:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
supplemental appropriation says the
 
05:33:07.730 --> 05:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
clerk of the convention shall deliver or
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
mail to each member of the County
 
05:33:11.448 --> 05:33:11.458 align:start position:0%
Convention will be in office on the date
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the convention vote in the proposed
 
05:33:16.250 --> 05:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
supplement approach appropriation and to
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
the chairperson
 
05:33:20.810 --> 05:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
of the board of Selectmen in each town
 
05:33:24.110 --> 05:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
and the mayor in each City within the
 
05:33:26.810 --> 05:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
county and to the Secretary of State a
 
05:33:28.190 --> 05:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
statement including the amount of
 
05:33:29.868 --> 05:33:29.878 align:start position:0%
proposed supplemental appropriation
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
meaning what you're going to have to pay
 
05:33:34.970 --> 05:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
and the objects for which your money is
 
05:33:38.090 --> 05:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
required the witness shall suspend can
 
05:33:40.810 --> 05:33:40.820 align:start position:0%
you able to wrap this up
 
05:33:43.788 --> 05:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
yeah I've got one page thank you so the
 
05:33:46.250 --> 05:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
point is
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
the town of Farmington was never
 
05:33:48.240 --> 05:33:50.510 align:start position:0%
the town of Farmington was never
notified

05:33:50.510 --> 05:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
notified
 
05:33:52.490 --> 05:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state was never
 
05:33:52.500 --> 05:33:53.930 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state was never
notified

05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
notified
 
05:33:55.788 --> 05:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
you know they know they don't care about
 
05:33:57.530 --> 05:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
these other towns
 
05:34:02.270 --> 05:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:05.930 --> 05:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's troubling is very often I've seen
 
05:34:07.490 --> 05:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
I've witnessed it firsthand with the
 
05:34:10.430 --> 05:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
other towns aren't even considered as
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
long as they take care of Nova
 
05:34:12.718 --> 05:34:14.090 align:start position:0%
long as they take care of Nova
Somersworth

05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
Somersworth
 
05:34:18.350 --> 05:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
in in Rochester and Durham now the this
 
05:34:20.390 --> 05:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I know this because it
 
05:34:22.490 --> 05:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
was in the paper that's the only way I
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
know because information is very
 
05:34:27.530 --> 05:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
difficult to get from the county
 
05:34:30.110 --> 05:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners at least the chair of
 
05:34:31.730 --> 05:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
the commission went to
 
05:34:31.740 --> 05:34:33.230 align:start position:0%
the commission went to
Rochester

05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
he went to Dover he went to Somersworth
 
05:34:39.350 --> 05:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
and he went to Durham and he gave a
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
presentation on the new nursing home and
 
05:34:45.050 --> 05:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
what he was proposing I don't believe he
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
went to any of the other nine towns and
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
discussed with them what they were
 
05:34:53.570 --> 05:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
proposing so this is the fairness this
 
05:34:56.868 --> 05:34:56.878 align:start position:0%
is why we need to have a change is it
 
05:35:00.050 --> 05:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
fair this bill absolutely is it is it
 
05:35:02.690 --> 05:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do absolutely
 
05:35:04.850 --> 05:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
and these are just a couple of examples
 
05:35:06.770 --> 05:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot more in the four years
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
that I've been there recently and I
 
05:35:11.390 --> 05:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for talking loud but I'm hard
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
of hearing so I want to make sure
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
everybody can hear me and I think I've
 
05:35:18.050 --> 05:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
had one page on this and my my
 
05:35:20.150 --> 05:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
information came from the Secretary of
 
05:35:22.190 --> 05:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
State's office and I will provide you
 
05:35:24.890 --> 05:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
one copy of that and answer any
 
05:35:27.110 --> 05:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
questions if you have any thank you

the committee have questions for the
 
05:35:31.620 --> 05:35:35.868 align:start position:0%
the committee have questions for the
witness

05:35:35.868 --> 05:35:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:38.270 --> 05:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you well thank you you
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
made it easy I just might testify again
 
05:35:49.628 --> 05:35:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.050 --> 05:35:53.060 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:36:05.810 --> 05:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:07.550 --> 05:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:36:07.560 --> 05:36:10.570 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
committee

05:36:10.570 --> 05:36:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:13.010 --> 05:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Burnham and I
 
05:36:15.850 --> 05:36:15.860 align:start position:0%
represent District 2 which is Milton
 
05:36:18.650 --> 05:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
Milton Mills I have to say that even
 
05:36:20.330 --> 05:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
though as I'm part of the official name
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
but also Rochester Ward 5.
 
05:36:24.120 --> 05:36:25.010 align:start position:0%
but also Rochester Ward 5.
yeah

05:36:25.010 --> 05:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:36:27.410 --> 05:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
as a current chair of the Milton Board
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen and tax paying resident of
 
05:36:34.010 --> 05:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
Milton for 27 years I have many reasons
 
05:36:36.650 --> 05:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
why I think this bill should be voted
 
05:36:38.090 --> 05:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
05:36:40.970 --> 05:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
Milton and Milton Mills Villages are
 
05:36:45.250 --> 05:36:45.260 align:start position:0%
combined as small as a small town of
 
05:36:49.868 --> 05:36:49.878 align:start position:0%
4482 residents providing about
 
05:36:53.390 --> 05:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
277 taxpayers
 
05:36:56.288 --> 05:36:56.298 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 the Milton voters
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly voted in a petition
 
05:37:01.490 --> 05:37:01.500 align:start position:0%

05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
sensor 2021 budget our budget committee
 
05:37:13.128 --> 05:37:13.138 align:start position:0%
and select board have worked endlessly
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
to honor our residents with reducing our
 
05:37:16.680 --> 05:37:18.288 align:start position:0%
to honor our residents with reducing our
budget

05:37:18.288 --> 05:37:18.298 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:37:21.770 --> 05:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
returning 1.4 million dollars of
 
05:37:23.750 --> 05:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
unassigned fund balance
 
05:37:26.810 --> 05:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
through the reduction of our tax rate
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining our dra
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations of 5 to 16 percent of
 
05:37:33.890 --> 05:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
our operating budget for unanticipated
 
05:37:33.900 --> 05:37:35.628 align:start position:0%
our operating budget for unanticipated
emergencies

05:37:35.628 --> 05:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
in 2021 Milton's County tax was in the
 
05:37:42.650 --> 05:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
amount of 1 million two hundred three
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
thousand three hundred and sixty four
 
05:37:48.050 --> 05:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
dollars which is about 21 of our
 
05:37:49.730 --> 05:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
05:37:52.550 --> 05:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be added to our own tax rate
 
05:37:55.490 --> 05:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
as Milton continued to streamline their
 
05:37:57.230 --> 05:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
2022 budget
 
05:37:59.990 --> 05:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
keeping under the two percent tax cap
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
during an inflationary fiscal year
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
the board and budget committee were
 
05:38:09.650 --> 05:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
horrified to receive in October the new
 
05:38:13.250 --> 05:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
County amount of 1 million four hundred
 
05:38:15.350 --> 05:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand seven hundred and
 
05:38:18.410 --> 05:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
ninety seven dollars to be paid by
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
December 17 2022
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
this was an increase of 247
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
433 dollars or the rate of 21 more than
 
05:38:32.868 --> 05:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
the previous year
 
05:38:35.810 --> 05:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
this tax bill was three times higher
 
05:38:38.930 --> 05:38:38.940 align:start position:0%
than any previous increase and placed
 
05:38:41.330 --> 05:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
our town office on high alert
 
05:38:43.490 --> 05:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
in the last days of our fiscal year
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
trying to set the tax rate getting it
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
approved by the dra and finally finally
 
05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
issuing the tax bills to the residents
 
05:38:55.010 --> 05:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
and homestead tax revenue would flow
 
05:38:57.470 --> 05:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
quickly before the county tax payment
 
05:38:57.480 --> 05:38:59.330 align:start position:0%
quickly before the county tax payment
deadline

05:38:59.330 --> 05:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
as a small town the select board are
 
05:39:04.730 --> 05:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible for the town budget
 
05:39:08.090 --> 05:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
and retaining our staff with that budget
 
05:39:10.550 --> 05:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
however with further increases proposed
 
05:39:12.110 --> 05:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
by the Stratford County Commissioners
 
05:39:14.810 --> 05:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
Milton and other small towns will be
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
forced to exceed their tax cap to offset
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
these proposed amounts which are set
 
05:39:23.330 --> 05:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
after sb2 fiscal year budgets
 
05:39:25.550 --> 05:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
that are voted in
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
how much should small towns anticipate
 
05:39:30.590 --> 05:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
County tax increases when the county
 
05:39:33.530 --> 05:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
does not honor small town tax caps
 
05:39:35.690 --> 05:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
at a recent Stratford County delegation
 
05:39:37.730 --> 05:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
public hearing and meeting
 
05:39:40.010 --> 05:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
a commissioner had stated
 
05:39:42.410 --> 05:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
for the 14th year in a row the proposed
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
budget is below the tax caps of three
 
05:39:46.570 --> 05:39:46.580 align:start position:0%
Stratford County cities of Dover
 
05:39:49.250 --> 05:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
Somersworth and Rochester
 
05:39:51.530 --> 05:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
I personally asked the commissioner what
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
happened to the tax cap of Milton
 
05:39:56.030 --> 05:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
and he answered that because of the
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
increase of value in Milton is why there
 
05:40:01.128 --> 05:40:01.138 align:start position:0%
is an increase in the county tax amount
 
05:40:02.990 --> 05:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what type of financial
 
05:40:05.448 --> 05:40:05.458 align:start position:0%
principles are used in this method
 
05:40:07.730 --> 05:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
but I am certain it is not in the best
 
05:40:10.550 --> 05:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
interest of Milton's residence
 
05:40:13.610 --> 05:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
HB 270 gives Milton other small towns in
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
Stratford County an opportunity to have
 
05:40:18.890 --> 05:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
a voice that speaks for them regardless
 
05:40:20.570 --> 05:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
of party
 
05:40:23.810 --> 05:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
and a face to which a voter can feel
 
05:40:26.690 --> 05:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
confident in electing thank you for your
 
05:40:26.700 --> 05:40:28.970 align:start position:0%

thank you representative other questions
 
05:40:37.610 --> 05:40:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.948 --> 05:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none I do have a copy if you'd
 
05:40:41.170 --> 05:40:41.180 align:start position:0%
like for the record
 
05:40:52.128 --> 05:40:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:54.590 --> 05:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
next the chair would like to recognize
 
05:41:11.448 --> 05:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:13.310 --> 05:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for the
 
05:41:15.230 --> 05:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
time to testify my name is
 
05:41:17.570 --> 05:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly butenza I represent
 
05:41:20.448 --> 05:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
Stratford District district 19. that's
 
05:41:22.610 --> 05:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
Rochester's Awards one two three four
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
and six
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm a newly elected State Rep so all
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the stuff is is um is new for me so
 
05:41:34.730 --> 05:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
everything from of course uh coming to
 
05:41:36.890 --> 05:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
community hearings and and
 
05:41:39.288 --> 05:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
um and being on a committee but also the
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state delegation so
 
05:41:44.690 --> 05:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
um just in in kind of what I've what
 
05:41:46.730 --> 05:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
I've witnessed and what you've already
 
05:41:49.788 --> 05:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
heard this is really it has nothing to
 
05:41:52.850 --> 05:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
do with party and um I was kind of upset
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
to hear that because if this changes
 
05:41:58.610 --> 05:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
which every single other
 
05:42:01.128 --> 05:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
County in the entire State and I have it
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
right here up on my phone it is only
 
05:42:05.650 --> 05:42:05.660 align:start position:0%
Stratford County that is truly being
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised and if they all elect it
 
05:42:10.010 --> 05:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter who they elect
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
Democrat Republican it's it's really not
 
05:42:14.208 --> 05:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
about that it's having representation
 
05:42:17.448 --> 05:42:17.458 align:start position:0%
it's having a voice which was already
 
05:42:21.470 --> 05:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
said and the example of the budget going
 
05:42:23.868 --> 05:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
to that last delegation meeting it's
 
05:42:23.878 --> 05:42:24.770 align:start position:0%
to that last delegation meeting it's
clear

05:42:24.770 --> 05:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
clear
 
05:42:28.610 --> 05:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
the focus is on Dover Rochester in
 
05:42:31.270 --> 05:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
Somersworth and all of these other towns
 
05:42:35.330 --> 05:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
Barrington Durham Lee Middleton New
 
05:42:38.350 --> 05:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
Durham Rollinsford Stratford Farmington
 
05:42:41.510 --> 05:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
Madbury and Milton are left out in the
 
05:42:41.520 --> 05:42:42.410 align:start position:0%
Madbury and Milton are left out in the
dust

05:42:42.410 --> 05:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
dust
 
05:42:43.788 --> 05:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's clear
 
05:42:47.510 --> 05:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you can watch the zooms it's it's
 
05:42:50.448 --> 05:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear so the example of the
 
05:42:50.458 --> 05:42:51.650 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear so the example of the
budget

05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
budget
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
um was also concerning because I didn't
 
05:42:53.878 --> 05:42:54.770 align:start position:0%
um was also concerning because I didn't
know

05:42:54.770 --> 05:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:42:56.690 --> 05:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
um with tax caps and understanding that
 
05:42:58.610 --> 05:42:58.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that we should be
 
05:43:02.090 --> 05:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
bragging about how people aren't are you
 
05:43:03.770 --> 05:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
know they're saving money or they're
 
05:43:05.690 --> 05:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
going to be underneath but Rochester
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
every single person that I'm talking to
 
05:43:09.770 --> 05:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
in my Wards is paying more in their
 
05:43:12.350 --> 05:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
taxes so I'm not really sure and I'm not
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
an expert on the budget so hence why I
 
05:43:14.878 --> 05:43:15.590 align:start position:0%
an expert on the budget so hence why I
want

05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
want
 
05:43:18.170 --> 05:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
um you know five years to compare it to
 
05:43:21.170 --> 05:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
so Eli I can be a good Steward for my
 
05:43:23.090 --> 05:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
constituents and I think that's what we
 
05:43:24.470 --> 05:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
want to be good stewards for our
 
05:43:24.480 --> 05:43:25.670 align:start position:0%
want to be good stewards for our
constituents

05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
05:43:28.190 --> 05:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
so I strongly support this and I hope
 
05:43:30.230 --> 05:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
that you all do as well this isn't about
 
05:43:32.690 --> 05:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
party this is about exactly what's
 
05:43:35.448 --> 05:43:35.458 align:start position:0%
happening in every other county in the
 
05:43:35.458 --> 05:43:36.590 align:start position:0%
happening in every other county in the
state

05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:43:40.610 --> 05:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
05:43:44.810 --> 05:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair recognizes
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
05:43:55.010 --> 05:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
so you said this is not about party
 
05:43:57.650 --> 05:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
but the prime sponsor says it is about
 
05:44:00.650 --> 05:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
party I'm confused
 
05:44:05.770 --> 05:44:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:09.110 --> 05:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
well I'm actually I don't think he meant
 
05:44:10.610 --> 05:44:10.620 align:start position:0%
it that way I think he was talking about
 
05:44:13.730 --> 05:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
representation so he's he's saying 60
 
05:44:16.250 --> 05:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
40. if you look at Stratford County in
 
05:44:20.270 --> 05:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
60 40 is 60 Democrat and Republican and
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
those are you know it that's party right
 
05:44:25.788 --> 05:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
um but for example we have a we have an
 
05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
election a special election coming up in
 
05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
in Ward everybody knows about it right
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
in Ward four of Rochester right now his
 
05:44:35.930 --> 05:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
name's David Walker the the leading
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
long-standing icon
 
05:44:41.150 --> 05:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
um Democrat that's is actually sending
 
05:44:42.890 --> 05:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
out a an endorsement letter for Mr
 
05:44:44.208 --> 05:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
Walker because he's fiscally
 
05:44:46.010 --> 05:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
conservative so I don't think it's about
 
05:44:47.208 --> 05:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
that I think he was talking about
 
05:44:49.010 --> 05:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
representation and unfortunately
 
05:44:50.090 --> 05:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you're talking about
 
05:44:51.770 --> 05:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
representation you have to talk about
 
05:44:54.530 --> 05:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
party so I don't think that's his his
 
05:44:56.930 --> 05:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
point he's basically saying that you've
 
05:44:59.150 --> 05:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
got people that have that are voting a
 
05:45:01.128 --> 05:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
certain way
 
05:45:02.750 --> 05:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
um in certain towns that are not being
 
05:45:04.670 --> 05:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
represented because it's an at large and
 
05:45:06.890 --> 05:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
it is the only County of course in the
 
05:45:06.900 --> 05:45:08.510 align:start position:0%
it is the only County of course in the
state

05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:45:11.868 --> 05:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
foreign further questions the chair
 
05:45:17.330 --> 05:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:21.890 --> 05:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
so if this truly isn't about party then
 
05:45:26.090 --> 05:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
why is it that every single co-sponsor
 
05:45:29.690 --> 05:45:29.700 align:start position:0%
and person who has representative who
 
05:45:32.330 --> 05:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
has testified in favor of this bill
 
05:45:34.850 --> 05:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
so far has been a republican like
 
05:45:36.470 --> 05:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't you have at least found at
 
05:45:39.048 --> 05:45:39.058 align:start position:0%
least one Democrat to go along with you
 
05:45:43.448 --> 05:45:43.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.090 --> 05:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
well to be honest I'm here today and
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
this is I don't want to say last minute
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
but it is I didn't I'm a brand new state
 
05:45:52.788 --> 05:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
representative I'm brand new on the
 
05:45:55.548 --> 05:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
delegation I don't even know
 
05:45:57.170 --> 05:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
um I can't Patrol thank you you are on
 
05:46:03.470 --> 05:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
our you are on our delegation but I
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't these are all new people to me so
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah if there was more time I'd be
 
05:46:11.930 --> 05:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
I'd definitely be um talking to the
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
fellow Democrats and and having them
 
05:46:15.530 --> 05:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
come here because it's everybody's voice
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
that should be heard it's not about
 
05:46:16.798 --> 05:46:19.190 align:start position:0%
that should be heard it's not about
party

05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:22.610 --> 05:46:22.620 align:start position:0%

I'm here representing the um exactly the
 
05:46:39.530 --> 05:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
citizens of Rochester and Stratford
 
05:46:44.690 --> 05:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:48.650 --> 05:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:55.128 --> 05:46:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.288 --> 05:46:57.298 align:start position:0%
next the chair calls representative
 
05:47:08.230 --> 05:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
05:47:15.590 --> 05:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
I'm welcoming myself back to my not
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
quite in it but Minnesota county used to
 
05:47:22.990 --> 05:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
stop right there this was uh
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
Transportation or something I think I
 
05:47:28.128 --> 05:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
served here for three years and sat well
 
05:47:31.250 --> 05:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's all differently configured now uh
 
05:47:34.730 --> 05:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
but uh but I've been on Edna for the
 
05:47:37.250 --> 05:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
past 16 years
 
05:47:40.730 --> 05:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and I am also
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
not coincidentally the chairman of the
 
05:47:47.150 --> 05:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
Stratford County delegation so I see my
 
05:47:49.010 --> 05:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
colleague representative turcotte I see
 
05:47:50.690 --> 05:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
my colleague representative terlevan
 
05:47:52.510 --> 05:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
05:47:56.090 --> 05:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
and from Stratford County that is all of
 
05:47:58.030 --> 05:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
you are my colleagues
 
05:48:03.410 --> 05:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
but I'm here in opposition to 270
 
05:48:08.890 --> 05:48:08.900 align:start position:0%
because uh I I it has some technical
 
05:48:12.170 --> 05:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
problems that I that I think
 
05:48:12.180 --> 05:48:13.390 align:start position:0%
problems that I that I think
um

05:48:13.390 --> 05:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
can be can be avoided and I don't know
 
05:48:19.850 --> 05:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
whether the committee has been informed
 
05:48:21.770 --> 05:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
but there is an alternative out there
 
05:48:24.650 --> 05:48:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Holland I I sent you an
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
email with it I try to send it to
 
05:48:29.570 --> 05:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative 11 as well uh some of you
 
05:48:33.048 --> 05:48:33.058 align:start position:0%
I don't have your email addresses and I
 
05:48:35.930 --> 05:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
was my brain was half over in Edna where
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
we were having executive session all
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I had to get back there so
 
05:48:43.250 --> 05:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
I didn't think that I if I fooled around
 
05:48:44.868 --> 05:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
with it I think I could have sent it to
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
the whole Municipal and County
 
05:48:49.310 --> 05:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
government committee but but uh so I
 
05:48:50.990 --> 05:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
think that the alternative is better
 
05:48:53.090 --> 05:48:53.100 align:start position:0%
because as I understand it and I only
 
05:48:56.030 --> 05:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
flew over it before I sent it off to the
 
05:48:59.208 --> 05:48:59.218 align:start position:0%
two Representatives I named a moment ago
 
05:49:01.448 --> 05:49:01.458 align:start position:0%
um uh the the
 
05:49:07.788 --> 05:49:07.798 align:start position:0%
chairs uh Bill splits both Dover and
 
05:49:10.548 --> 05:49:10.558 align:start position:0%
Rochester the two largest cities in
 
05:49:12.530 --> 05:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
Stratford County
 
05:49:14.750 --> 05:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and the alternative splits only
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
Somersworth which is not only the
 
05:49:19.670 --> 05:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
smallest city but but considerably
 
05:49:22.610 --> 05:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
smaller it's only about 11 000 people
 
05:49:25.250 --> 05:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
whereas built over in Rochester are
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
about 33 000 people and that's one of
 
05:49:31.128 --> 05:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
the realities in Stratford county is we
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
are a small County and area where the
 
05:49:37.430 --> 05:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
fourth smallest fourth largest county in
 
05:49:41.090 --> 05:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh so a small County with the
 
05:49:45.840 --> 05:49:47.890 align:start position:0%
um and uh so a small County with the
population

05:49:47.890 --> 05:49:47.900 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:49:51.650 --> 05:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
very substantially centered in the three
 
05:49:53.448 --> 05:49:53.458 align:start position:0%
cities of Dover Rochester and
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
Somersworth which are right side by side
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the reality is that
 
05:50:05.590 --> 05:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
those those cities uh you know tophers
 
05:50:09.610 --> 05:50:09.620 align:start position:0%
has all Democratic Representatives
 
05:50:11.810 --> 05:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
sums with has all Democratic
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives Rochester has one at the
 
05:50:16.250 --> 05:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
moment and possibly another one or not
 
05:50:18.288 --> 05:50:18.298 align:start position:0%
depending on the outcome of the special
 
05:50:20.930 --> 05:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
election that represented Potenza just
 
05:50:24.288 --> 05:50:24.298 align:start position:0%
referred to a moment ago so the reality
 
05:50:26.750 --> 05:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that we have
 
05:50:30.048 --> 05:50:30.058 align:start position:0%
majority elections uh in this country
 
05:50:33.430 --> 05:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
except for the presidential
 
05:50:36.670 --> 05:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
contest which is you know
 
05:50:40.128 --> 05:50:40.138 align:start position:0%
uh somewhat represented by the popular
 
05:50:42.530 --> 05:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
vote or representative of the popular
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
vote but it's not a popular vote
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
um so the the fact that we have
 
05:50:53.090 --> 05:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
a regularly three Democratic
 
05:50:55.368 --> 05:50:55.378 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is a result of the fact
 
05:50:55.378 --> 05:50:56.628 align:start position:0%
Commissioners is a result of the fact
that

05:50:56.628 --> 05:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:50:59.930 --> 05:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's a democratic County over you know
 
05:51:04.208 --> 05:51:04.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.270 --> 05:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
regularly we don't have we didn't have a
 
05:51:11.270 --> 05:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
no contest contest in this last election
 
05:51:14.090 --> 05:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
there were three Republican candidates
 
05:51:16.250 --> 05:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
running against the three Democratic
 
05:51:19.730 --> 05:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
incumbents but we've had time after time
 
05:51:24.288 --> 05:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
after time we've had no Republican run
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
for County Commissioner so of course and
 
05:51:30.830 --> 05:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
but we have occasionally had Republicans
 
05:51:32.930 --> 05:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
run and win
 
05:51:38.448 --> 05:51:38.458 align:start position:0%
and so uh I I think that you know the
 
05:51:41.208 --> 05:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
the county delegation has not
 
05:51:44.270 --> 05:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
had any opportunity to look at this and
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
if they had I don't think we would have
 
05:51:49.310 --> 05:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know only Republican Representatives
 
05:51:54.350 --> 05:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
here to testify besides myself uh and I
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think that given the fact that these
 
05:51:58.970 --> 05:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
this alternative plan that I've already
 
05:52:00.770 --> 05:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
pointed out to you which I will
 
05:52:04.128 --> 05:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
distribute as much as possible is it is
 
05:52:08.288 --> 05:52:08.298 align:start position:0%
better for a fairer because the chair
 
05:52:12.010 --> 05:52:12.020 align:start position:0%
represents turkot my friend my friend uh
 
05:52:20.448 --> 05:52:20.458 align:start position:0%
uh is uh is uh is correct that all the
 
05:52:21.770 --> 05:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
other counties
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:52:25.850 --> 05:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
have districts
 
05:52:27.890 --> 05:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
but there's more than just a coincidence
 
05:52:31.788 --> 05:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
in the fact that Rockham county is much
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
larger than Stratford County both in
 
05:52:37.970 --> 05:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
size and in population to run
 
05:52:40.128 --> 05:52:40.138 align:start position:0%
county-wide in Rockingham County or
 
05:52:41.628 --> 05:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County for that matter
 
05:52:45.110 --> 05:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be ruinously expensive for a
 
05:52:46.670 --> 05:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I'm sure they come have
 
05:52:48.170 --> 05:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
to come up with a fair amount of money
 
05:52:50.650 --> 05:52:50.660 align:start position:0%
just to run in their districts
 
05:52:53.330 --> 05:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative can you you able to wrap
 
05:52:55.368 --> 05:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
this up because you're well over you're
 
05:52:58.010 --> 05:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
approaching six minutes okay I didn't
 
05:53:00.128 --> 05:53:00.138 align:start position:0%
put down a Time Madam chair
 
05:53:02.448 --> 05:53:02.458 align:start position:0%
but but I am the chairman of the
 
05:53:04.190 --> 05:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
Stratford County and I have been for
 
05:53:07.850 --> 05:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
over 10 years so I do have a strong uh
 
05:53:11.330 --> 05:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
connection to the Stratford County and
 
05:53:13.548 --> 05:53:13.558 align:start position:0%
the serving Stratford County and I want
 
05:53:15.048 --> 05:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
to see that if we're going to have
 
05:53:17.448 --> 05:53:17.458 align:start position:0%
districts I want to see that we have the
 
05:53:20.150 --> 05:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
best plan if we're going to have a plan
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
at all so I'll be happy to answer end my
 
05:53:25.128 --> 05:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
testimony and answer any questions that
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
I can
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt are
 
05:53:30.948 --> 05:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
there questions yes the chair recognizes
 
05:53:33.708 --> 05:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
representative mandaputi thank you madam
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Schmidt
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:53:40.250 --> 05:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you would refer to Hillsborough
 
05:53:43.208 --> 05:53:43.218 align:start position:0%
County to the two largest cities
 
05:53:45.590 --> 05:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Nashua are in
 
05:53:48.890 --> 05:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and we have 13 other
 
05:53:48.900 --> 05:53:50.030 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and we have 13 other
towns

05:53:50.030 --> 05:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
towns
 
05:53:53.948 --> 05:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
but consistently we have had
 
05:53:57.350 --> 05:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
all three Commissioners Republican
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners does that make a
 
05:54:03.048 --> 05:54:03.058 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of it's the voter's
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
Choice do you feel at large or
 
05:54:06.360 --> 05:54:09.110 align:start position:0%
Choice do you feel at large or
district-wise

05:54:09.110 --> 05:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
district-wise
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
it is the voter's choice and we are
 
05:54:15.650 --> 05:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
honoring that do you think this uh at
 
05:54:18.288 --> 05:54:18.298 align:start position:0%
large is not honor honoring the voter's
 
05:54:18.298 --> 05:54:20.150 align:start position:0%
large is not honor honoring the voter's
choice

05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:54:22.910 --> 05:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
well I I don't feel that I have the
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
necessary expertise I certainly don't
 
05:54:27.470 --> 05:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
think I don't think that the commit that
 
05:54:30.708 --> 05:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
our three Commissioners uh govern as
 
05:54:35.208 --> 05:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
democrats for Democrats and and govern
 
05:54:39.230 --> 05:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
as uh against Republicans they are
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
governing for the benefit of the
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
citizens of Stratford County in the
 
05:54:44.990 --> 05:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
services that Trafford County provides
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
which are excellent uh and I think I
 
05:54:50.750 --> 05:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
think that that's as close as I can come
 
05:54:54.410 --> 05:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:56.570 --> 05:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
further questions the chair represents
 
05:54:58.610 --> 05:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:55:00.650 --> 05:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
Cahill thank you madam chair thank you
 
05:55:01.788 --> 05:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:55:05.150 --> 05:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here if you have the best plan how
 
05:55:06.770 --> 05:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
come you didn't share it with the whole
 
05:55:06.780 --> 05:55:08.150 align:start position:0%
come you didn't share it with the whole
committee

05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
I don't have your
 
05:55:14.390 --> 05:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
your email address and the email address
 
05:55:16.610 --> 05:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
that I had before I had to rush out to
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
go back to I got called back to my uh to
 
05:55:25.070 --> 05:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
my voting on my executive session I had
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Holland's email address
 
05:55:29.330 --> 05:55:29.340 align:start position:0%
and representative Tre Levin's address
 
05:55:31.490 --> 05:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
and I tried to get it in their hands so
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
that they could share it with you
 
05:55:36.288 --> 05:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
there's nothing partisan about about the
 
05:55:38.990 --> 05:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
email and if I'd thought about it I
 
05:55:41.570 --> 05:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
could have sent it to the hill committee
 
05:55:41.580 --> 05:55:43.030 align:start position:0%
could have sent it to the hill committee
okay

05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:55:46.010 --> 05:55:46.020 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:55:53.208 --> 05:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:54.948 --> 05:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
next the chair will recognize
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:07.128 --> 05:56:07.138 align:start position:0%
ah thank you for letting me testify
 
05:56:07.138 --> 05:56:08.090 align:start position:0%
ah thank you for letting me testify
today

05:56:08.090 --> 05:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:56:10.670 --> 05:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
um my name is James Connor I am a
 
05:56:14.628 --> 05:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
representative of strep 19 which is five
 
05:56:17.628 --> 05:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
Awards out of the six in Rochester uh
 
05:56:20.628 --> 05:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
first term and I strongly agree with
 
05:56:23.690 --> 05:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
this bill as to what has been stated
 
05:56:23.700 --> 05:56:25.128 align:start position:0%
this bill as to what has been stated
from

05:56:25.128 --> 05:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:56:26.990 --> 05:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
prior testimony
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
people in the northern part of our
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
County gets no representation in the
 
05:56:35.330 --> 05:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office they might say
 
05:56:38.810 --> 05:56:38.820 align:start position:0%
they do but they don't
 
05:56:42.350 --> 05:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner's Office only you know
 
05:56:45.530 --> 05:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
caters to a few towns or cities
 
05:56:47.750 --> 05:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's it that's why they want their
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
money that's where they get it from
 
05:56:50.160 --> 05:56:51.708 align:start position:0%
money that's where they get it from
so

05:56:51.708 --> 05:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
if we were if strep County was split up
 
05:56:59.628 --> 05:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
into three and if the people voted in
 
05:57:01.850 --> 05:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
three Democrats then well then we'd have
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
to live with it
 
05:57:05.470 --> 05:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
okay that's what the people voted for
 
05:57:09.470 --> 05:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
but you're based most of your votes
 
05:57:13.368 --> 05:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
in Durham Dover and Somersworth that's
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
where they get their votes all the time
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
and I just saw the numbers and only one
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
of them would have won in Rochester
 
05:57:26.570 --> 05:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
and not by much
 
05:57:29.330 --> 05:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just gonna reiterate what
 
05:57:33.470 --> 05:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
they just said that's all thank you
 
05:57:36.288 --> 05:57:36.298 align:start position:0%
thank you representative does the
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%

northern farmer area in your county
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
don't you think you would better
 
05:57:53.150 --> 05:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
represent the farmers from that
 
05:58:03.230 --> 05:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.708 --> 05:58:06.718 align:start position:0%

Towns
 
05:58:56.690 --> 05:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
I've also served in this legislature
 
05:58:59.930 --> 05:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
many years ago and I enjoyed serving on
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
the Hillsborough County delegation for
 
05:59:04.430 --> 05:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
many years and the executive committee
 
05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
eventually becoming chair of the
 
05:59:09.590 --> 05:59:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County delegation and I've
 
05:59:11.030 --> 05:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
been president of the New Hampshire
 
05:59:13.310 --> 05:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
Association of counties
 
05:59:15.288 --> 05:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
and I really feel privileged that I've
 
05:59:18.170 --> 05:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to participate and
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
to learn as much as I can about the
 
05:59:23.868 --> 05:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
vital services that we County
 
05:59:26.390 --> 05:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and all of the state
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
representatives provide to the citizens
 
05:59:32.090 --> 05:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's 10 counties and as
 
05:59:34.730 --> 05:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
you all know the counties differ from
 
05:59:36.890 --> 05:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
one another and they organize themselves
 
05:59:40.128 --> 05:59:40.138 align:start position:0%
in different ways and that's why I
 
05:59:42.830 --> 05:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 270.
 
05:59:45.530 --> 05:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
I think Stratford County the state's
 
05:59:47.030 --> 05:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
smallest county and we've talked about
 
05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
this already geographically should
 
05:59:52.330 --> 05:59:52.340 align:start position:0%
continue to elect Commissioners at large
 
05:59:55.610 --> 05:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
I also think that redistricting should
 
05:59:57.948 --> 05:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
occur only every 10 years in a
 
06:00:01.670 --> 06:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
thoughtful way with some time to make
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
good decisions and I think the Supreme
 
06:00:07.670 --> 06:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
Court has already ruled on this issue so
 
06:00:10.190 --> 06:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
I recommend that maybe we should wait 10
 
06:00:13.310 --> 06:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
years for the next redistricting before
 
06:00:16.610 --> 06:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
applying this bill to Stratford County
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your consideration
 
06:00:21.470 --> 06:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
please vote in expedient to legislate
 
06:00:24.470 --> 06:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
for house bill 270.
 
06:00:26.990 --> 06:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner Pappas
 
06:00:28.970 --> 06:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes Representatives
 
06:00:28.980 --> 06:00:30.948 align:start position:0%
um the chair recognizes Representatives
Davis

06:00:30.948 --> 06:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:00:32.638 --> 06:00:34.730 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and thank you for taking my
question

06:00:34.730 --> 06:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:00:38.868 --> 06:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
can you explain or account for
 
06:00:41.570 --> 06:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
the anger that's been voiced here
 
06:00:43.788 --> 06:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
on the part of certain citizens who feel
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
that they are not being represented to
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
you do you understand what that
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:03.288 --> 06:01:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:07.010 --> 06:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
 
06:01:07.020 --> 06:01:07.970 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry
um

06:01:07.970 --> 06:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:12.048 --> 06:01:12.058 align:start position:0%
no I I don't I think you asked do I
 
06:01:14.208 --> 06:01:14.218 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
06:01:14.218 --> 06:01:15.048 align:start position:0%
understand it
um

06:01:15.048 --> 06:01:15.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:17.208 --> 06:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
I was I lost my train of thought what
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:22.448 --> 06:01:22.458 align:start position:0%
I may have lost my train of thought too
 
06:01:26.510 --> 06:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
but I hear some very strong feelings
 
06:01:30.470 --> 06:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
being articulated in this debate
 
06:01:33.410 --> 06:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
they don't come from nowhere they must
 
06:01:36.110 --> 06:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
come from somewhere and I'm trying to
 
06:01:39.650 --> 06:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
get a sense of what it's about
 
06:01:43.548 --> 06:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
before you answer that the chair
 
06:01:45.470 --> 06:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
the chair feels that that's an
 
06:01:47.030 --> 06:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
inappropriate question because the
 
06:01:47.040 --> 06:01:47.990 align:start position:0%
inappropriate question because the
witness

06:01:47.990 --> 06:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
witness
 
06:01:52.850 --> 06:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
has no idea why other people
 
06:01:55.610 --> 06:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
testify or say what they say
 
06:01:58.368 --> 06:01:58.378 align:start position:0%
well may I just say that I I feel that
 
06:02:00.110 --> 06:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
County government should actually be
 
06:02:02.930 --> 06:02:02.940 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I never understood why we
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
had parties attached to our names for
 
06:02:08.690 --> 06:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners is it's really very
 
06:02:10.850 --> 06:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
very part non-partisan
 
06:02:13.310 --> 06:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
so Hillsborough County as one of the
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
representatives said has the state's two
 
06:02:22.490 --> 06:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
largest cities and 27 towns and we all
 
06:02:25.070 --> 06:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
seem to understand that each of us have
 
06:02:27.110 --> 06:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
different issues
 
06:02:31.490 --> 06:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't become a non- a partisan
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
kind of debate in Hillsborough County so
 
06:02:37.850 --> 06:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
I have no idea why we're here today
 
06:02:43.208 --> 06:02:43.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:45.948 --> 06:02:45.958 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative man
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
japoodi thank you madam chair thank you
 
06:02:50.990 --> 06:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner Pappas for taking my
 
06:02:54.310 --> 06:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
question you represent the largest city
 
06:02:59.030 --> 06:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
and two small towns do
 
06:03:02.628 --> 06:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
you get I mean you've served many terms
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
as a commissioner like you alluded to
 
06:03:09.650 --> 06:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
do you feel like you are representing
 
06:03:13.610 --> 06:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
the other two towns also where you have
 
06:03:16.670 --> 06:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
the constituency or you just focused on
 
06:03:19.490 --> 06:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh Manchester
 
06:03:21.770 --> 06:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
oh I feel strongly that I represent
 
06:03:25.548 --> 06:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Two Towns I love going
 
06:03:28.070 --> 06:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
out to New Boston which is a beautiful
 
06:03:31.070 --> 06:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
little New Hampshire town and I've met
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
many people there and made many friends
 
06:03:35.750 --> 06:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
and I do understand that their issues
 
06:03:37.970 --> 06:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
are different than the issues we have in
 
06:03:37.980 --> 06:03:39.170 align:start position:0%
are different than the issues we have in
Manchester

06:03:39.170 --> 06:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
06:03:42.410 --> 06:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
Bedford also has has a whole different
 
06:03:44.048 --> 06:03:44.058 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:03:46.868 --> 06:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
culture and neighborhood
 
06:03:49.730 --> 06:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
and different kinds of wants and needs
 
06:03:50.868 --> 06:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
but we
 
06:03:54.170 --> 06:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
I do my best to represent everyone and I
 
06:03:56.270 --> 06:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
hope I do it successfully
 
06:03:58.670 --> 06:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
06:04:01.070 --> 06:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes you may thank you madam
 
06:04:04.670 --> 06:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh one follow-up in terms of the
 
06:04:08.208 --> 06:04:08.218 align:start position:0%
big cities providing a lot of social
 
06:04:12.048 --> 06:04:12.058 align:start position:0%
services in the small towns unable to
 
06:04:15.490 --> 06:04:15.500 align:start position:0%
provide that because of the small town
 
06:04:18.170 --> 06:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have this conversation all the time
 
06:04:19.970 --> 06:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
in our County
 
06:04:23.150 --> 06:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
how does that balance out
 
06:04:26.690 --> 06:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
because the revenue is generated by the
 
06:04:31.010 --> 06:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
large cities to third one-third and
 
06:04:34.010 --> 06:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
does that take your time share in terms
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
of being a commissioner
 
06:04:38.930 --> 06:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
where you have to balance where the
 
06:04:41.810 --> 06:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
revenue the services and how it affects
 
06:04:43.910 --> 06:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
the neighboring towns
 
06:04:46.850 --> 06:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
I think we do our best to provide the
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
services equally to all of our County
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
Citizens for example we have Meals on
 
06:04:54.470 --> 06:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
Wheels which is funded by County
 
06:04:57.350 --> 06:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
government not entirely of course
 
06:04:59.810 --> 06:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels as a non-profit that
 
06:05:01.788 --> 06:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
serves Manchester Nashua and all the
 
06:05:04.910 --> 06:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
towns so there is there are many
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
examples of non-profit organizations
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
that are involved with County government
 
06:05:12.170 --> 06:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
and other services that just apply
 
06:05:12.180 --> 06:05:13.730 align:start position:0%
and other services that just apply
equally

06:05:13.730 --> 06:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
equally
 
06:05:18.048 --> 06:05:18.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:23.810 --> 06:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
06:05:25.548 --> 06:05:25.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:05:28.010 --> 06:05:28.020 align:start position:0%

County Commissions in Stratford County I
 
06:06:04.190 --> 06:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
had the unique uh
 
06:06:06.170 --> 06:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
honor of being elected by the people of
 
06:06:07.850 --> 06:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
Stratford County recently to my 20th
 
06:06:08.750 --> 06:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
term on the board of County
 
06:06:08.760 --> 06:06:10.128 align:start position:0%
term on the board of County
Commissioners

06:06:10.128 --> 06:06:10.138 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
I've been there 40 years
 
06:06:14.448 --> 06:06:14.458 align:start position:0%
prior to that I was in the legislature
 
06:06:16.850 --> 06:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s I served on this committee
 
06:06:18.708 --> 06:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
I'm also a former two-term mayor of the
 
06:06:20.208 --> 06:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
city of Dover
 
06:06:22.430 --> 06:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
I'm a former past president of the New
 
06:06:23.810 --> 06:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties and
 
06:06:25.250 --> 06:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
I've served
 
06:06:28.250 --> 06:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
15 terms as chairman
 
06:06:30.048 --> 06:06:30.058 align:start position:0%
of all the County Commissioners in our
 
06:06:30.058 --> 06:06:32.868 align:start position:0%
of all the County Commissioners in our
state

06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:35.448 --> 06:06:35.458 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:06:37.670 --> 06:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
I am not going to spend to waste your
 
06:06:39.590 --> 06:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
time on many of the things that were
 
06:06:41.390 --> 06:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
said today
 
06:06:42.890 --> 06:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
first of all I think this bill should
 
06:06:44.090 --> 06:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
have been in front of election law or
 
06:06:46.190 --> 06:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
not this committee but be that as may I
 
06:06:47.208 --> 06:06:47.218 align:start position:0%
don't mind coming back to my old
 
06:06:51.288 --> 06:06:51.298 align:start position:0%
committee I served here in the 1970s
 
06:06:54.590 --> 06:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
historically what has happened uh
 
06:06:56.208 --> 06:06:56.218 align:start position:0%
with County governments is that the
 
06:06:57.770 --> 06:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
county delegation would mean if there
 
06:07:00.470 --> 06:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
was a concern regarding the election of
 
06:07:01.610 --> 06:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or the creation of
 
06:07:03.890 --> 06:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts historically the
 
06:07:05.448 --> 06:07:05.458 align:start position:0%
county delegation would meet and have
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
those debates I've been through five of
 
06:07:08.930 --> 06:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
these processes
 
06:07:10.368 --> 06:07:10.378 align:start position:0%
five of them
 
06:07:12.770 --> 06:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
the county delegation would meet they
 
06:07:15.410 --> 06:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
would have a discussion and uh
 
06:07:18.170 --> 06:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
they'd make a decision
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
now Chicago county is somewhat unique as
 
06:07:22.910 --> 06:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
a long history of kind of being picked
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
on for lack of a better term but
 
06:07:27.350 --> 06:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh shravagan is the smallest
 
06:07:29.030 --> 06:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
geographically it definitely takes 25
 
06:07:31.310 --> 06:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
minutes to get from one end to the other
 
06:07:33.170 --> 06:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
although as the fourth most populous
 
06:07:33.180 --> 06:07:33.948 align:start position:0%
although as the fourth most populous
County

06:07:33.948 --> 06:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
County
 
06:07:35.868 --> 06:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
06:07:37.250 --> 06:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
historically what has happened is the
 
06:07:39.708 --> 06:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
county delegation has met and had
 
06:07:42.530 --> 06:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
determined on multiple occasions since
 
06:07:44.330 --> 06:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
1940 that it was best to elect their
 
06:07:46.490 --> 06:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners at large and there
 
06:07:48.410 --> 06:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
were a number of reasons for that
 
06:07:51.048 --> 06:07:51.058 align:start position:0%
I can go over some of them with you now
 
06:07:53.750 --> 06:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
number one in order to to divide counted
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Stratford County up in the districts
 
06:07:57.230 --> 06:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
you have to carve cities up
 
06:07:59.390 --> 06:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
the cities were very very upset with
 
06:08:01.490 --> 06:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
that the county delegations back then
 
06:08:02.930 --> 06:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
didn't want to do that
 
06:08:05.390 --> 06:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh and therefore that was one of the
 
06:08:07.368 --> 06:08:07.378 align:start position:0%
major reasons why
 
06:08:10.128 --> 06:08:10.138 align:start position:0%
that's uh number one number two it's
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
been represented to that the three
 
06:08:13.788 --> 06:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities spend 60 percent of the
 
06:08:16.670 --> 06:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
county budget which is which is pretty
 
06:08:19.548 --> 06:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
close to being accurate
 
06:08:24.170 --> 06:08:24.180 align:start position:0%
but this uh idea of uh that we do not
 
06:08:26.510 --> 06:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
pay attention to the small towns or we
 
06:08:28.970 --> 06:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
don't give any of them any uh deference
 
06:08:30.890 --> 06:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
is just ridiculous
 
06:08:33.530 --> 06:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
it's just ridiculous we're in a process
 
06:08:34.730 --> 06:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
right now of spending three and a half
 
06:08:36.590 --> 06:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars to upgrade their
 
06:08:38.390 --> 06:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
dispatch services for all the towns the
 
06:08:42.530 --> 06:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
county dispatches for all 10 Towns
 
06:08:45.230 --> 06:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
we provide that Public Service uh to
 
06:08:47.570 --> 06:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
those communities
 
06:08:51.410 --> 06:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
also uh you've heard right now there's a
 
06:08:52.970 --> 06:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
there's a political debate going on and
 
06:08:54.170 --> 06:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
let me back up just for a minute about
 
06:08:56.208 --> 06:08:56.218 align:start position:0%
the redistricting committee
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
the districting committee met in every
 
06:09:00.530 --> 06:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
County I had a conversation with the
 
06:09:03.110 --> 06:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative terracott and he talked
 
06:09:05.330 --> 06:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
to me for about a 45-minute conversation
 
06:09:07.190 --> 06:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
while this committee was looking at
 
06:09:09.410 --> 06:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
districts across the state and he asked
 
06:09:10.368 --> 06:09:10.378 align:start position:0%
me about what we should do about
 
06:09:11.750 --> 06:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
Stratford County
 
06:09:14.810 --> 06:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
I didn't I had mentioned to him that uh
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
the history of it and what happened as
 
06:09:18.650 --> 06:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned to you
 
06:09:21.470 --> 06:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
and uh I didn't think it was in The
 
06:09:23.510 --> 06:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
public's long-term interest to divides
 
06:09:24.890 --> 06:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
traffic County up in the in the
 
06:09:24.900 --> 06:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
traffic County up in the in the
districts

06:09:26.150 --> 06:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
districts
 
06:09:28.970 --> 06:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
and Beyond the cut the testimony that
 
06:09:30.350 --> 06:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard here
 
06:09:31.970 --> 06:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
I have served with Republican County
 
06:09:31.980 --> 06:09:33.230 align:start position:0%
I have served with Republican County
Commissioners

06:09:33.230 --> 06:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
06:09:35.510 --> 06:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
we've had sheriffs that were Republicans
 
06:09:37.190 --> 06:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
I've had a county treasure that was a
 
06:09:38.570 --> 06:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
republican he was there for 20 some odd
 
06:09:39.948 --> 06:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
years had an opposition every year
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
always won the sheriffs were Republicans
 
06:09:44.628 --> 06:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
I served with more Republican sheriffs
 
06:09:46.970 --> 06:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
than I have with Democratic sheriffs
 
06:09:49.270 --> 06:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
06:09:54.048 --> 06:09:54.058 align:start position:0%
and those folks came from small towns
 
06:09:55.730 --> 06:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
we had a Sheriff for 25 years it came
 
06:09:58.310 --> 06:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
from Madbury probably the smallest town
 
06:10:00.730 --> 06:10:00.740 align:start position:0%
in Stratford County
 
06:10:03.948 --> 06:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
I've served with a republican County
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioner from the town of Stratford
 
06:10:08.150 --> 06:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
I have more people living on my street
 
06:10:10.430 --> 06:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
in Dover than they have in the whole
 
06:10:11.868 --> 06:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
town of Stratford
 
06:10:14.510 --> 06:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
so this idea that the the people had
 
06:10:14.520 --> 06:10:16.190 align:start position:0%
so this idea that the the people had
disenfranchised

06:10:16.190 --> 06:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised
 
06:10:19.850 --> 06:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
I I can tell you in my 20 terms there
 
06:10:21.650 --> 06:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
I've been nominated by the Republican
 
06:10:25.788 --> 06:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:28.010 --> 06:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the past election which I thought was
 
06:10:29.390 --> 06:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a strong Republican year and
 
06:10:31.850 --> 06:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
you look back at all every 10 years we
 
06:10:33.048 --> 06:10:33.058 align:start position:0%
have you know every 10 years we have a
 
06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
strong Republican year here in New
 
06:10:34.558 --> 06:10:35.570 align:start position:0%
strong Republican year here in New
Hampshire

06:10:35.570 --> 06:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
I had opposition I was the top vote
 
06:10:37.558 --> 06:10:38.628 align:start position:0%
I had opposition I was the top vote
Gunner

06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
Gunner
 
06:10:40.850 --> 06:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
every Republican strong year I was the
 
06:10:42.650 --> 06:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
top vote getter now if the people didn't
 
06:10:44.090 --> 06:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
want me there because I'm the big bad
 
06:10:45.590 --> 06:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
Boogeyman here in the room if the people
 
06:10:46.548 --> 06:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
didn't want me they could have
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to throw me out
 
06:10:50.448 --> 06:10:50.458 align:start position:0%
but they haven't done that and I'm
 
06:10:51.770 --> 06:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
hopeful that the reason why they haven't
 
06:10:54.288 --> 06:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
done that is because I'm trying to do a
 
06:10:55.910 --> 06:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
good job for the for all the people of
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
Stratford County
 
06:10:59.690 --> 06:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
we don't act in a partisan matter on any
 
06:10:59.700 --> 06:11:00.708 align:start position:0%
we don't act in a partisan matter on any
issue

06:11:00.708 --> 06:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact in the past 25 years
 
06:11:06.170 --> 06:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
the county budget has been passed almost
 
06:11:08.208 --> 06:11:08.218 align:start position:0%
with the unanimous vote by Democrats and
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
Republicans buying maybe one or two
 
06:11:12.170 --> 06:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
votes in 25 years
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
the boats have been practically
 
06:11:13.680 --> 06:11:15.948 align:start position:0%
the boats have been practically
unanimous

06:11:15.948 --> 06:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
06:11:19.788 --> 06:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
now recently uh recently
 
06:11:23.090 --> 06:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
the county started a process of talking
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
about building a new nursing home and
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
there were some members of the of the of
 
06:11:27.948 --> 06:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
the delegation who were against
 
06:11:29.810 --> 06:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
construction of a new nursing home they
 
06:11:30.530 --> 06:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
didn't want to give the county
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
commissions a blank check and I don't
 
06:11:34.190 --> 06:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
blame them on that I can understand that
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
if you want to know where the anger is
 
06:11:37.610 --> 06:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
coming from this is where the anger is
 
06:11:38.930 --> 06:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
coming from some of them oppose the
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
construction or the expense of a new
 
06:11:43.190 --> 06:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a new nursing home they say they
 
06:11:44.570 --> 06:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
support the new nursing home but they're
 
06:11:48.230 --> 06:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
upset about the expense and I get that
 
06:11:48.240 --> 06:11:49.610 align:start position:0%
upset about the expense and I get that
but

06:11:49.610 --> 06:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:11:51.410 --> 06:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:11:54.530 --> 06:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
to divide the city of Dover and the City
 
06:11:56.448 --> 06:11:56.458 align:start position:0%
of Rochester the two massive the two
 
06:11:58.010 --> 06:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
major property taxpayers in the county
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
divide that in half and somehow think
 
06:12:02.150 --> 06:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to gerrymander this thing
 
06:12:05.208 --> 06:12:05.218 align:start position:0%
so that a republican gets elected
 
06:12:07.128 --> 06:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
I suppose you have the power to do that
 
06:12:09.230 --> 06:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
but the Supreme Court is ruled
 
06:12:11.150 --> 06:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
on multiple occasions about the latest
 
06:12:13.490 --> 06:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
occasion saying that you have to do that
 
06:12:15.470 --> 06:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
once every 10 years
 
06:12:18.948 --> 06:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
that window has passed
 
06:12:21.230 --> 06:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
there are court cases on this in New
 
06:12:21.240 --> 06:12:22.128 align:start position:0%
there are court cases on this in New
Hampshire

06:12:22.128 --> 06:12:22.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
that basically say now read I'll read
 
06:12:27.288 --> 06:12:27.298 align:start position:0%
from the case the latest case
 
06:12:29.390 --> 06:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
Court ruled finally we held that once
 
06:12:30.830 --> 06:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature has fulfilled this
 
06:12:32.810 --> 06:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to reapportion
 
06:12:36.830 --> 06:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
based upon a decennial census figures
 
06:12:39.170 --> 06:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
it has no constitutional authority to
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
make another apportionment until the end
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
of the next federal census
 
06:12:44.390 --> 06:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is our New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
06:12:45.650 --> 06:12:45.660 align:start position:0%
ruled this
 
06:12:48.830 --> 06:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
in a very similar case for this and
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
Canon and rocket out of Rockingham
 
06:12:52.970 --> 06:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
County excuse me commissioner could are
 
06:12:58.010 --> 06:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:59.690 --> 06:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
the point being is that the Supreme
 
06:13:02.708 --> 06:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
Court is recognized that
 
06:13:05.150 --> 06:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering or adjusting adjusting
 
06:13:07.788 --> 06:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
these districts uh based on who gets
 
06:13:09.230 --> 06:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
elected every two years
 
06:13:11.090 --> 06:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
is ill-advised
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
they don't think it's constitutional I
 
06:13:13.730 --> 06:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
think you need to go through this pain
 
06:13:15.770 --> 06:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
once let the dust settle you go for 10
 
06:13:17.690 --> 06:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
years and you do it again
 
06:13:21.350 --> 06:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this bill doesn't
 
06:13:24.110 --> 06:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
will not meet constitutional muster it
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a difference how you divide
 
06:13:27.890 --> 06:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
the county up because that window is
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
passed you want to do it nine years from
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
now you probably have the power to do it
 
06:13:33.170 --> 06:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
but I think it's still advised
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
with that I'll answer any questions
 
06:13:37.670 --> 06:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
does the committee have any questions
 
06:13:41.930 --> 06:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:44.690 --> 06:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
the chair rep recognizes representative
 
06:13:44.700 --> 06:13:47.090 align:start position:0%
the chair rep recognizes representative

is democratic what percentage does
 
06:14:04.490 --> 06:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
Republican do you have a large quantity
 
06:14:09.708 --> 06:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
of independent voters the the larger the
 
06:14:11.090 --> 06:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
largest portion of the voters in
 
06:14:14.030 --> 06:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
Stratford County are independent
 
06:14:16.128 --> 06:14:16.138 align:start position:0%
now we've had shifts
 
06:14:17.990 --> 06:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
we had it goes back and forth we've had
 
06:14:21.230 --> 06:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
times when the Republican party uh had
 
06:14:24.350 --> 06:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
more registered voters uh it happened
 
06:14:26.690 --> 06:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
when McCain Rafa president the
 
06:14:28.670 --> 06:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
Republican party was much stronger at
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
the time
 
06:14:31.368 --> 06:14:31.378 align:start position:0%
and then it then it should but it
 
06:14:33.048 --> 06:14:33.058 align:start position:0%
shifted back and forth when I was first
 
06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
on the county delegation 45 48 years ago
 
06:14:38.208 --> 06:14:38.218 align:start position:0%
the delegation was a republican
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
delegation the county delegation
 
06:14:42.530 --> 06:14:42.540 align:start position:0%

kamash
 
06:15:20.810 --> 06:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm from Milton New Hampshire
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
and uh as a resident of Stratford County
 
06:15:25.490 --> 06:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm frustrated to live in the only
 
06:15:27.230 --> 06:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
County New Hampshire that has a uniquely
 
06:15:28.850 --> 06:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
unfair method of electing County
 
06:15:28.860 --> 06:15:30.170 align:start position:0%
unfair method of electing County
Commissioners

06:15:30.170 --> 06:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
Commissioners
 
06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
the current at-large system does not
 
06:15:34.128 --> 06:15:34.138 align:start position:0%
account for the voices and wishes of
 
06:15:35.868 --> 06:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
many many of the citizens that live in
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the smaller towns outside of the three
 
06:15:40.670 --> 06:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
main cities of Rochester Somersworth and
 
06:15:44.330 --> 06:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
Dover such as the town I live in Milton
 
06:15:46.128 --> 06:15:46.138 align:start position:0%
there's no justification for such
 
06:15:48.890 --> 06:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
discrepancy among counties within the
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
same state
 
06:15:52.250 --> 06:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
fairness and representation for all
 
06:15:55.070 --> 06:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
Stratford County residents should be the
 
06:15:57.350 --> 06:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
utmost concern for house members
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 270 will address this long
 
06:16:01.368 --> 06:16:01.378 align:start position:0%
Injustice once and for all
 
06:16:03.110 --> 06:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
I urge all house members to ask
 
06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
themselves why Stratford county has a
 
06:16:08.390 --> 06:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
different election Paradigm in votes to
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
make all New Hampshire counties equal at
 
06:16:10.320 --> 06:16:11.448 align:start position:0%
make all New Hampshire counties equal at
