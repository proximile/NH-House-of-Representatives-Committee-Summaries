first bill House Bill 146 related
 
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
closure of state liquor stores and Dan
 
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
are you going to introduce this then
 
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.310 align:start position:0%
are you going to introduce this then
okay

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
more gooder
 
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative district 9
 
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 align:start position:0%
representing uh representative leishman
 
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
who's unable to be here this morning
 
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill 46 146 is really very simple
 
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
it asks that the Liquor Commission prior
 
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
to closing any existing store notify the
 
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee uh having been a
 
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
member of the fiscal committee for about
 
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
two decades I've got great familiarity
 
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh where we review all the audit reports
 
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
we have uh Financial oversight of all
 
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as receive and expend
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
uh funds roughly responsible for about a
 
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
billion dollars off budget uh during the
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
overall times the primary part is we
 
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
receive all audits and those are
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
reported out of the fiscal committee to
 
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
the appropriate committees and we also
 
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation based on those
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
audits uh one of the other sponsors of
 
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
the bill representative Rosenwald was
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
distressed and she has subbed on fiscal
 
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
that a liquor store in downtown
 
00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
Nashville was closed without any kind of
 
00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
a notification it appears that the
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission believes since they
 
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
are an Enterprise fund that they may not
 
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
have to answer certain issues and they
 
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
will tell you or likely to tell you that
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have to respond rapid fire to
 
00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 align:start position:0%
either acquire a lease cancel a lease
 
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
make an agreement or whatever
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
here's the facts
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
they know what the lease is ending way
 
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 align:start position:0%
and if they don't somebody needs to be
 
00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.890 align:start position:0%
and if they don't somebody needs to be
replaced

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
they negotiate leases usually well in
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
advance and if they don't that's another
 
00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:56.990 align:start position:0%
advance and if they don't that's another
issue

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
but the simple fact is fiscal meets
 
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
every single month
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
timelines are not very difficult here
 
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be oversight of every
 
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 align:start position:0%
agency fiscal is the agency that does
 
00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.270 align:start position:0%
agency fiscal is the agency that does
that

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
this is not rocket science and I would
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
ask for your support of House Bill 146 I
 
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
will be happy to answer any questions
 
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
you may have and I thank representative
 
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald will be here at some
 
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
point as well
 
00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 align:start position:0%
great do we have questions from the
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
committee members yeah representative
 
00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.830 align:start position:0%
committee members yeah representative
Burroughs

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
Burroughs
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
just thank you for taking my question
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that one of the reasons
 
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
that fiscal needs this information is
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
because it could have uh impact on the
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
budget and that you need to make
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments um accordingly is that true
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true you need to make
 
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
it well you need to have the foresight
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
of me how it may or may not affect the
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
budget or whether
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
there is sound reasoning for the closure
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's understandable that Liquor
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
Commission may want to have a Superstore
 
00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that area but if they also
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
have a central store that is showing a
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
profit is there a legitimate reason for
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
closing it uh just an overview of the
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
legitimacy and the logic behind their
 
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
decisions thank you
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
other questions to the community to
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent me I see here it says uh
 
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.689 align:start position:0%
represent me I see here it says uh
approval

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
so what is fiscal committee's uh
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
parameters in true in terms of of
 
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
approving it what would their guidelines
 
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
and be about what they would approve and
 
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
not approve
 
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal soundness of the decision does
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
it make sense
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
is it going to benefit the budget or is
 
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 align:start position:0%
it going to be a detriment to the budget
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I think certainly local politics are
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
going to have some play if nothing else
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
notification I know that the frustration
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
was with Nashua was
 
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't know about it until it was
 
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.029 align:start position:0%
they didn't know about it until it was
over

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh both the constituency and the
 
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 align:start position:0%
legislative Representatives
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal makes decisions based on finance
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
and soundness every single month in the
 
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 align:start position:0%
parameter of the entire state government
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
this would be nothing new and we deal
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
regularly with with the Liquor
 
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
Commission the reason I ask that because
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
my memory was though it used to be this
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
way and then we made that decision not
 
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
to do it because we really wanted to
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility put upon the
 
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
commission to make those decisions and
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
so just
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
just a a timing thing like being gee I
 
00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
wish I had known ahead of time doesn't
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
seem like a real excuse or real
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
reasoning uh I mean I'd say that well uh
 
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
I understand the economic piece but like
 
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
you said it's politics now and and
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
politics is don't we want to take
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
politics out of that decision
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
I think any decision is going to have
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
politics in it in this building no
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
matter what happens but it still comes
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
down to basic economic soundness fiscal
 
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
committee should be aware of the
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
long range and short-range production of
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission and I will tell
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
you that um
 
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous times
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund be damned yes they're an
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
that the Primacy of the legislature
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
should hold in overseeing overviewing
 
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
and deciding what the actual parameters
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
are for financial soundness there are
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
times that it has been very difficult to
 
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
get straight answers at fiscal out of a
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I think this will
 
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500 align:start position:0%
simplify and help
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
well maybe it would simplify if they
 
00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:40.979 align:start position:0%
just let you know ahead of time until
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
you start making plans for it but the
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
key word here is approval
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
because I just can't imagine fiscal ever
 
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
approving a closing of a store
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
because of politics
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
I would disagree with that and I would
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
disagree that strongly in that having
 
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
been in fiscal for a long time we've
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
recommended closures of stores prior
 
00:08:02.039 --> 00:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
recommended closures of stores prior
um

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county be an example and you
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
know as well as I do we had a senator at
 
00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
one point uh some time back that wanted
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
a liquor store in every community and we
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh on a per capita basis probably had
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
more liquor stores than anyone on the
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
planet and I was one that went to the
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
governor and the Liquor Commission and
 
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.969 align:start position:0%
governor and the Liquor Commission and
said

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
this is a lot of money waste here and
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
time to clean it up as and they started
 
00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.950 align:start position:0%
time to clean it up as and they started
to

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
fair enough any other questions the
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony oh did you want
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
it you wanted to ask a question I'm
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
sorry you really need to take a question
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative thank you sorry I didn't
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
thank you I wanted to know what the
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
timeline would be so with this process
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
is there you know 30 days what is the
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
timeline that you would be recommending
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
for this quote approval a week the next
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
meeting of a committee fiscal has a
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much standard routine unless
 
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.910 align:start position:0%
pretty much standard routine unless
there's

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
a major lack of information
 
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
that they make a decision in a day on
 
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
the date that we once a month so we
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
usually have all the information that
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
goes through the legislative budget
 
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
assistant well in advance that provides
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
all the parameters that we need to know
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
for information and if it can't be
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
approved that day
 
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860 align:start position:0%
it would be based on specific questions
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
that have not been answered they would
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
be given directly to the commission to
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
report back at the next meeting and if
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
and there should never be but if
 
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
for some reason there was a time is of
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
the essence necessity fiscal has the
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
always always has the ability to have a
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I understand
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
it so it could be several months
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically it could be several months
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
by the time it gets on a calendar and
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
scheduled and reviewed and special
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
meetings so there is a time element
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
I would strongly disagree fiscal's track
 
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
record is the Liquor Commission submits
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee has what's called
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
pre-fiscal you go through all of that
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
information all the details uh a week in
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
advance you have the information usually
 
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
prior to that and when you open up
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal you have that agency come in
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
answer your questions and you make a
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
decision immediately it would only be an
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
extreme where it'd be questions
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
unanswered where you'd have them come
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
back up the following month for a
 
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
decision I don't remember anything
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
and we dealt with an awful lot of very
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
very complex issues that wasn't handled
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh Dan McGuire as we're representative
 
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.470 align:start position:0%
uh Dan McGuire as we're representative
McGuire

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman the
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire and I represent
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
the town of Epsom
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm here because uh uh I I do
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
support the bill and I wanted to support
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
in particular my chairman uh
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
in my town I have a little anecdote
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
about this in that
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
um so my town just recently maybe a year
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
ago or so got a very nice brand new
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
large liquor store right on the corner
 
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
of on the traffic circle yes uh the
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
corner of Route 28th and route 4. and
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%
and the town I I currently only rep due
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
to redistricting I only represent Epsom
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
but previously I'd also represented the
 
00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
town of Pittsfield next door and that
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
town used to have a very small liquor
 
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.630 align:start position:0%
town used to have a very small liquor
store

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:11:47.329 --> 00:11:47.339 align:start position:0%
right downtown maybe a third or a
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
quarter of the size of the new store and
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
and the town of Pittsfield has a lot of
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
downtown apartments
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
um and and citizens of modest means and
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
I expect that
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
um they typically would walk to that
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
liquor store whereas the new liquor
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
store it's not a walking distance of
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
anybody you know so so it you know it's
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
a significant inconvenience to the
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
people at Pittsfield I'm sure when they
 
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
closed that small one in favor of of our
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
large one one town over so it was great
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
for me not so good for them and the the
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
law as you you read it here
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
requires 30 days public notice not much
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
notice but but what is what is the
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
public supposed to do with that notice
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
right I mean the you know there's nobody
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
to talk to or or mention you know bring
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
it up at all and so this is a very
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
Modest Proposal that at least lets
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who's being a affected speak to
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
their to a legislator I mean that's our
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
job is to listen to our constituents and
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and you know I don't say that they did
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
the wrong thing in this particular case
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
um but at least it would give people a
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
way to make themselves hurt
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
um and I agree absolutely with
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton that the fiscal
 
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
committee does not
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know I I think political I I was
 
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:20.180 align:start position:0%
only on it one term but but
 
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
the primary consideration of the fiscal
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee is monetary matters and and
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
they do act relatively quickly things
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
are added to the agenda
 
00:13:35.329 --> 00:13:35.339 align:start position:0%
um maybe it could be easily a week or
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
less before the actual meeting so so
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bill does not necessarily affect
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
the timeline of closing stores and the
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
example I gave you I mean it took a year
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
to build the new store they knew that
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
was going to be open and the other one
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
was going to be closed well in advance
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
so there's lots of time involved in in
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
processing this so I think this is a
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
modest bill it just adds a step that
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
that allows our branch of government to
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
at least listen to their constituents
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
and possibly make some input so thank
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you thank
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to give a hypothetical
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
using the Pittsfield one that you gave
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
let's say that this liquor store was
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
unprofitable and um although it was
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
convenient to these constituents do you
 
00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:33.899 align:start position:0%
think that the constituents should have
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
a say in whether an unprofitable
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
business should be allowed to continue
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
well certainly I think everybody should
 
00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
have a say I mean that's why we have
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
public hearings right but but in this
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
case in in the what you uh
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you're a hypothetical
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
I do think the story should be closed
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
right so yeah I don't know I don't
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
personally know whether that store was
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
profitable or not I assume it was it was
 
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:03.660 align:start position:0%
there for a very long period of time
 
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
right so they they hadn't tried to close
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
it until there was another large store
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
nearby right so thank you
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have to admit I can't
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
imagine any store being unprofitable
 
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
I mean I would assume that even the
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
smallest little operation they you know
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
is the Liquor Commission so of course
 
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:27.500 align:start position:0%
they must make
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point it makes money so
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
so my question is when I look at this
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
has to uh approve say to improve
 
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
profitability and efficiency
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
which brings me to the question because
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
we just had our little hearing and we
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
know that the uh the labor market is
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
really tough right now and the
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
commission is really short on Staffing
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
and so this seemed like the worst
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
possible time to pass this legislation
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
because that their what they're trying
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
to do is create more efficiency so I
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
assume the bigger store that opened up
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
in Epson uh is far more profitable and
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
far more efficient in terms of use of
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
personnel than the one they were closing
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
and I don't I'm not sure
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
that even the way this if this language
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
here it would have saved that little
 
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
store if those factors are taken in
 
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.710 align:start position:0%
store if those factors are taken in
consideration

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yeah I don't
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that that story should
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
have been kept I'm just saying it was a
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
situation where the public could give
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
their input to somebody who would listen
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
to it right and make it make a a sort of
 
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
a larger decision if it was a very close
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
call I mean let's say that store was was
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
very profitable but but just tiny right
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
then maybe somebody would make a
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
decision to keep it okay
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
um that's all I mean in this I think
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're right in the sense that
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
if they're having trouble Staffing this
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
store so therefore the hours are getting
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
cut down right then it isn't profitable
 
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:03.860 align:start position:0%
it isn't makes sense to to pay rent
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh for very few hours right so you know
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sure like I say I'm sure it's still
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
profitable okay because it's the sticker
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
story everyone's profitable right yeah
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
not necessarily I mean imagine they have
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
one that doesn't make money
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
I mean if it's if it's something where
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's I'm it depends on how many
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
customers are in the locus of the of the
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
space right and if you started to have
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
big store big store big store around and
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know fewer and fewer customers start
 
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
coming to this place and you wouldn't
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
have it so yeah so I'm just looking at
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
that word efficiency I understand thank
 
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.090 align:start position:0%
that word efficiency I understand thank
you

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
that's represented very sorry uh thank
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
you commissioner just a quick question
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
when the the presentation on Tuesday by
 
00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
um they kept emphasizing over and over
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
that they ran as a business and if I
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
think of this as a business
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't we want to
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
do everything we could to enable them to
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
act as a business and would this be some
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
additional step that would uh infringe
 
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to fall back on what
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Eaton said and that is
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a business that's owned by
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
and so in some sense
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
um the the legislature is the is the
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
boss of that business right as the owner
 
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:42.620 align:start position:0%
of that business and and and so
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
you know we should have some control
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
over it right I mean it's just that
 
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.490 align:start position:0%
over it right I mean it's just that
simple

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you good yes uh represent Philip
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is a
 
00:18:56.169 --> 00:18:56.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up question to what you just said
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
what do you feel is the philosophical
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
difference between a publicly owned
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
business such as the New Hampshire
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission versus a private model
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
for example is what we see in
 
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.690 align:start position:0%
for example is what we see in
Massachusetts

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question but I I
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
guess I I think that's pretty far afield
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
from the scope of this particular bill
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think I'm prepared to talk
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay see you now thank you very much Dan
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I have one more card here
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the Liquor Commission
 
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman morning Mr

Commission with me is our CFO Tina
 
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.610 align:start position:0%
Commission with me is our CFO Tina
demirs

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to give you a little
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
background in history on this
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
uh since 1990 the New Hampshire Liquor
 
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:09.980 align:start position:0%
Commission has had the ability to close
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
our locations without legislative
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
oversight in order to run our business
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
history on the legislation and the
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
reporting in 2009 the commission had to
 
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
submit a quarterly report of the state
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
liquor stores that were closed in a uh
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and in then in
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
2012 they added Roman numeral number two
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
which added the requirement that we had
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
to prepare an indirect cost plan which
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
fairly allocated our overhead expenses
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
to all our stores so we treated the
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
profitability the same for all locations
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
so then excuse me in 2015 the language
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
changed to what it is today where we
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
still have to do the indirect cost plan
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
but we have to report 30 days after a
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
closure of the store when in 2012 what
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
we had to do was we had to report the
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
indirect cost plan three months prior to
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
the start of that fiscal year
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
so the change has been in what we have
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
to report as far as when the stores
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
close or for the indirect cost plan
 
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.270 align:start position:0%
close or for the indirect cost plan
itself

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
foreign and we do have to put a public
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
notice in the stores 30 days to prior to
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
closing the location
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
we talked on Tuesday about the ever
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
increasing competition in our
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and we also spoke
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
that 50 percent of the New Hampshire
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
Liquor commission's business comes from
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales
 
00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
one of the things we spoke briefly about
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
was Total Wine
 
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.220 align:start position:0%
247 stores 26 States 5 billion in sales
 
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.460 align:start position:0%
having seven stores in Massachusetts
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
opening two more in this upcoming year
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
Costco is opening two more in
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts BJ's is opening one more
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
and Market Basket Spirits is opening
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
four in Massachusetts and probably two
 
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
to three more in Maine
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
so competition is getting ever ever more
 
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
Fierce uh we're obviously running a
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
business here for the State of New
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we take that
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility very seriously
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
no one can can deny that the locations
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
that we have now are better locations
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're more visible to Consumers we
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
have an overall brand since 2010. we
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
have a logo we have a look we have a
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
Timber Peg we have a feel we have forest
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
green we have Granite facade people
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
recognize what we do people recognize
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
what we're building from the work that
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
we've done and the plans that we've laid
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
overall we're more profitable
 
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
our ability to respond to an
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
ever-changing real estate market is
 
00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
there no one can deny that the real
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
estate market is tough we're not going
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
to lean on that but we are going to lean
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
on that we're a business
 
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities come up our landlords do
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
not wait for the Liquor Commission to
 
00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
make decisions in a lot of cases
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
landlord participation is very important
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
to us the reason we've been able to grow
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
at the rate we've been able to grow over
 
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:24.740 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years is because of landlord
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
participation there's very little State
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
dollars that go into building these
 
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.630 align:start position:0%
dollars that go into building these
stores

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
the landlord pays for the fit up and we
 
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
include that fit up in our square
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
footage cost usually for the first 10
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
years of the lease and then it falls off
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
after 10 years so we're opening these
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
stores with very little State dollars
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
being put into place that being said the
 
00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
planning of these stores is 18 months to
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
two years or longer in advance so some
 
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
of the stores that we have closed during
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
covid were stores that we had planned to
 
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
close will use Derry for example we had
 
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:13.700 align:start position:0%
to close Dairy because we didn't have
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
the uh we didn't have the employees to
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
keep that store open it was a small
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
store we had planned on building a new
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
Dairy Store we had built a store in
 
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.669 align:start position:0%
Dairy Store we had built a store in
Londonderry

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
Londonderry
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
at Exit four and we had built a new
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
store in Londonderry and exit 5 on
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
either side so in our business decisions
 
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
we make the decision to close Derry
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
knowing that our consumers do not have
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
to travel very far in the interim to get
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
to a store while we're planning to build
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
most of our closures are given way to a
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
new outlet location so if we close a
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
store we open a store within that
 
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.029 align:start position:0%
store we open a store within that
proximity

00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
proximity
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
and it's all about convenience selection
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
prices but mainly convenience to our
 
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
consumers uh
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
the fact that we do not have to report
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
to the to the fiscal commission the
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee is is not uh
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
is not something that
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
we have to report to them so it's it's
 
00:25:21.289 --> 00:25:21.299 align:start position:0%
not something that we don't have to do
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
now we have to report to them but every
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
single store that we've closed we've
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
opened another store in proximity with
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
the exception of two and one was an
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
issue with the town that was in Stratham
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
that's it there's no jobs lost in these
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
transfers all employees for the Liquor
 
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.730 align:start position:0%
transfers all employees for the Liquor
Commission

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
have been moved to New and existing
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
locations when these when these new
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'll just add in
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
since 2010 we've added over 250 000
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
square feet in these new locations and
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
until 2020 we hadn't closed any stores
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
that we didn't relocate or consolidate
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
so in 2020 the stores that we closed we
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
closed because of staffing issues we
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
were down 40 full-time employees and we
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
were down 60 part-time employees so
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
originally we temporarily closed the
 
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
stores and then when the Staffing didn't
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
come back we had to reduce hours and
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
other locations then then it was decided
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
to close the locations permanently
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and one scenario that one
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
scenario that a business scenario that
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
needs to be put forth what if we've
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
planned for two years or longer to to
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
build a new store what if we've signed a
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
lease what if we've made concessions
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
with that landlord what if we've ordered
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
equipment our shelving takes 18 months
 
00:26:57.529 --> 00:26:57.539 align:start position:0%
to get right now
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
so when we plan these stores when you
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
see those new stores this is done in a
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
long time in advance and then we go to
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal and because of whatever reason
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to close that
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
particular store to open the new store
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
that is a business problem that I
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
believe that the state of New Hampshire
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
that relies on the profits of the Liquor
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
Commission and your constituents would
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
not want I do not believe and I have
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
spoken to
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of people in my 13
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
years at The Liquor Commission
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
everyone in the beginning was very
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
skeptical of the of what we were doing
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
but I knew that we were winning the
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
consumers over when people stopped
 
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
asking why are you changing my store to
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
when are you going to change my store
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
that is a huge move consumers like what
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
we're doing and again I cannot say
 
00:27:59.769 --> 00:27:59.779 align:start position:0%
enough we are not a standalone business
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our business comes from
 
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.610 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our business comes from
cross-border

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
cross-border
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
if when people get here they are not
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
wowed by what we do we lose
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative Terry thank you
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh if we could return for a moment to
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
the um the matter of the 30-day notice
 
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:25.340 align:start position:0%
certainly wondering if you could tell me
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
whether that is required by a statute or
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
whether that is an internal decision
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
with respect to the commission
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
if regardless of what the answer to that
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.330 align:start position:0%
question is
um

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:40.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
what is the intent of the 30-day notice
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
for example is it merely to advise your
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
customers that you will be doing
 
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.169 align:start position:0%
customers that you will be doing
something

00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
in 30 days
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
or is there a mechanism built into the
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
process such that you are
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
soliciting or you're at least welcoming
 
00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:06.419 align:start position:0%
feedback from customers as to their
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
response to your intent to close in 30
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
days and if this has ever been the case
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
or if it were to be the case would there
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
be any opportunity for reconsideration
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
on the part of the commission with
 
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
respect to its announced decision to
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
close thank you
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative the statute says that the
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has to give notice we
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
post a notice on the store in the store
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
in the location for 30 days and we post
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
notice in the newspaper uh given the the
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
reasons that I have spoken about and the
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
planning that it takes to build one of
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
these stores and
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
we have taken the Liquor Commission
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
stores out of the dog legs of plazas and
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
taken dingy small pakis and made them
 
00:30:00.889 --> 00:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
into a world-class business and we're
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
very proud of what we've done and I
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
think if we
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
did a survey of consumers I think
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
they're very happy with what they see is
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
really question me and Claire yeah I'm
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
sorry for not being clear with respect
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
to the second part of my question the
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
second part of my question was is there
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
a built-in mechanism to the notification
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
process such that you would either
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
solicit or welcome feedback from
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
customers that would be affected by the
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
closure and such that the commission
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
would take those into consideration
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
before making its final determination or
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
has the final determination already been
 
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
made and therefore the notice is just
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this and it's done
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
and there and there's no bias in this
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
question I'm asking for information no
 
00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
there's always an opportunity and we get
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of public comment about anything
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
that we do but there's nothing in the
 
00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:09.539 align:start position:0%
statute that requires us to do that
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
other than to post the public notice for
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
follow so therefore since there is
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
nothing in the statute that requires you
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
to do anything other than to notify the
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
public that you're going to close a
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
store therefore it is effectively a
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
decision that has already been made and
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
therefore any comment that you receive
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
will not have any effect upon potential
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of the decision that you
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
have already made yes or no sir I just
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
would you believe yeah that he's just
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
saying is that you know it's at that
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
point it is too late I mean this is a
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
Chicken and the Egg problems the plant
 
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
the planning has as long as it's long
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
it's been done so the answer is yes the
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
deals 30 days is just simply it's
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
notifying that this is coming up and and
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
where do you where do you need to start
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
looking how to get to thank you Mr
 
00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
chairman for your impressions and your
 
00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
Insight with respect to my questions
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
thanks for your help yes no answer to it
 
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.610 align:start position:0%
thanks for your help yes no answer to it
yes

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:09.620 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
would the insurance commission be more
 
00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable what liquor
 
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:24.710 align:start position:0%
oh it's it's liquor okay
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
oh it's it's liquor okay
[Laughter]

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
the uh I'm sorry would the Liquor
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
Commission be um thank you very much
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
um with the Liquor Commission be uh more
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh comfortable with the bill instead of
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
Prior approval it said prior notice
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
that the approval part is taken out from
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee that they don't
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
they don't have the opportunity to
 
00:32:45.779 --> 00:32:48.289 align:start position:0%
they don't have the opportunity to
approve

00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:48.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:51.649 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
30 days the 30 days is already in a
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
different statute right prior no
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
at the liquor store so it's not prior
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's not prior to it's giving notice to
 
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:07.700 align:start position:0%
the physical committee that we have
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
closed a store
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
so the that the indirect costs can be
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
allocated across the rest of the stores
 
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.509 align:start position:0%
allocated across the rest of the stores
evenly

00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
evenly
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative Sullivan
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
could you explain to us in the room just
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
what is the mission as it's specifically
 
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
laid out by the legislature is it to
 
00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.019 align:start position:0%
profit maximize is there another agenda
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
uh that you're supposed to be achieving
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
sure you yeah
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
no Ash a statute that that guides The
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is 176.3
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
optimize the profitability of the
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
commission maintain proper controls
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
assume the responsibility for Effective
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
and efficient operation of the
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
commission and provide service to the
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
customers of the commission okay and so
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for the question uh
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
how how do you see this potential
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
regulation impacting ability to achieve
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
that I mean so you you touched on a
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
little bit it would take away
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
potentially your ability to plan longer
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
term but are there other aspects that we
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
haven't touched on that this might
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
impact or prevent you from being able to
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
do it or better serve your ability to
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
fulfill that mission well uh being a
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
businessman and and giving Frank answers
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
I I will tell you that we the decisions
 
00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:32.419 align:start position:0%
that we make now are based on business
 
00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:36.020 align:start position:0%
criteria and they're based on the the
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
ability to move our stores uh where
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
consumers are with like Mike you can see
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
the stores that we've built we've built
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
them in areas where like-minded
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
consumers are there obviously we're with
 
00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
Market Basket we're with Hannaford's
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're with Costco we're with BJ's
 
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
if we turn these decisions into a
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
potential political decision that takes
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
away the ability of the commission to
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
run an effective and efficient operation
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you
 
00:35:16.569 --> 00:35:16.579 align:start position:0%
we have more questions
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative Fila you want to try
 
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.150 align:start position:0%
representative Fila you want to try
again

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you mentioned a
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
scenario before where there's the
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
potential that you could have signed a
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
lease already have entered into
 
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
agreements for product
 
00:35:32.089 --> 00:35:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh and then have to make the decision to
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
close the store due to that which could
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
be inconvenient due to the necessity If
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
This Were to pass to have to go to the
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
assuming at arguendo that this were to
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
pass and you did need to go to the
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to ask for the closure
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
of a store do you think that information
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
such as the signing of Elise and having
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
already entered into contracts for
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
product would be the type of information
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that you would present to the fiscal
 
00:35:59.810 --> 00:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
committee when asking for the permission
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
to close a store
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
absolutely it would be
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up for the question do you think
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
then that that would be the type of
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
information that could potentially be
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
considered by the committee when making
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
the decision as to whether it is
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not to close a store
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
anything that takes the decision away
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
from being a business decision on behalf
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
of the profitability and on behalf of
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
the statute that we're that we're
 
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
responsible to follow is would be a
 
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm used to it
 
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.790 align:start position:0%
that's okay I'm used to it
um

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.290 align:start position:0%
um
question

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
um if if the commission were to adopt a
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
policy change that would allow for
 
00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:57.740 align:start position:0%
greater transparency in these decisions
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
within a timely manner
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
would we then be able to at least
 
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate that rather than go through the
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I understand your question
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
policy change that would require you to
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
notify people and allow them an
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity some vehicle through which
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
they can find out about these things in
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
advance rather than go through the
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee well we do notify we
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
as part of the statute we do notify
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
people in advance 30 days in advance is
 
00:37:37.609 --> 00:37:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay now representative Walsh
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh it's the way
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at it from what the
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
information you provided it's not so
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
much store closings as you're moving to
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
a new location
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
and in fact it sounds like you've
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
actually only had two
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
actual store closings where they were
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
not options nearby is that correct
 
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
during covid in 2020 we closed seven
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
stores so seven of our least profitable
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
stores that had other locations that
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
were nearby or the two that had plans to
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
be renovated or I mean relocated already
 
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
in the queue
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
follow up for the question thank you so
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
when it is an actual move to a new
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
location as in the Epson example
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
scenario do you provide the employees at
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
the previous location that's closing
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
to work at the new location because it
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
is so nearby yes we do we transfer all
 
00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
our employees no in all in any closures
 
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
and in any new stores that have been
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
open no Liquor Commission employees have
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
been let go or laid off
 
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.650 align:start position:0%
been let go or laid off
none

00:38:59.650 --> 00:38:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
oh we have one more question sorry
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
question just a request could um you uh
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
submit your testimony please oh yes
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
clerk would like written testimony if
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
you have it that's great thank you thank
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you thank you thank
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
you all right this often happens when I
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
announce we have one card left we always
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
get another one that appears out of
 
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
nowhere Jim Demers who represents New
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%

uh who is in opposition to the bill and
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
wants to speak for two minutes
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and I'm sorry I
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to testify but um listening
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
to the testimony I felt that my group
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
would want to go on record
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
um in opposition to uh this this
 
00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation so for
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
the record my name is James Demers and
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
I'm here today on behalf of the New
 
00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Wine and Spirits Brokers
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
Association which are the four major
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
brokerage firms that Supply
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
distilled spirits and wines to the State
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
um and I think our concern is that this
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
would be a significant change that could
 
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
actually have the opposite effect
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
um of what is intended in the current
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
law to improve profitability and
 
00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:20.270 align:start position:0%
law to improve profitability and
efficiency

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
um I was a legislator back in the 1980s
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
and I actually remember a state senator
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
in the North Country who was outraged
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
that a little tiny non-profitable liquor
 
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.770 align:start position:0%
that a little tiny non-profitable liquor
store

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
was going to be merged into a bigger
 
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:39.180 align:start position:0%
store and the politics that broke out
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
was unbelievable
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
and my fear is that this could be
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
another situation that develops just
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
like that this industry has become
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
extremely competitive over the past few
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
years if you go to Massachusetts you now
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
see super stores that did not exist 10
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
years ago that are extremely competitive
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
uh liquor stores
 
00:41:06.599 --> 00:41:08.030 align:start position:0%
uh liquor stores
and

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
um I have to give the commission credit
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
that we have really moved toward new
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
stores that are long really were long
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
overdue and as a result of these new
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
stores these bigger stores that have
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
been uh built here in New Hampshire we
 
00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
are far more competitive with our
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
neighbor States we have greater
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
selections because the stores are so
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
much bigger
 
00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
um and as a result that has been a key
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
reason why the Liquor Commission has
 
00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:39.020 align:start position:0%
been able to continue to improve
 
00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:41.099 align:start position:0%
profitability for the State of New
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have a real fear that
 
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
if politics does interfere with these
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
decisions we're going to go back to the
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
days when stores literally are losing
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
money but the votes are there to keep
 
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
the store open and that really flies in
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
the face of what we've done
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
for over a decade now trying to give the
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission the ability to run the
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
stores like any other business would be
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you all right
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
with that we will close our public
 
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet there's one pro and
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.329 --> 00:42:43.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.359 --> 00:43:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:01.380 align:start position:0%

that's the longest part of my testimony
um

00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm here on behalf of a constituent
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
Bill proposed by my Croydon neighbor
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
Chris post who owns polyculture or
 
00:44:11.819 --> 00:44:13.550 align:start position:0%
Chris post who owns polyculture or
Brewery

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
Brewery
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
I perceive this as a simple
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
but perhaps nothing ends up simple I
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
the change in the RSA regarding the
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
licensing and Licensing fee for Nano
 
00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.290 align:start position:0%
licensing and Licensing fee for Nano
breweries

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
breweries
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
the bill would remove the requirement
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
that Nano breweries manufacture
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
beverages in a public building
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
the issue at the core of it is the
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
definition of public building
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
there are Nano breweries including
 
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:43.140 align:start position:0%
polyculture where the building for
 
00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:46.220 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is attached to a residence
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
but distinctly separate entrance and
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
operation and not part of the residence
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
this is permitted by federal law it's
 
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
not called a public building in federal
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
the I have to be careful that I say this
 
00:45:04.859 --> 00:45:06.829 align:start position:0%
the I have to be careful that I say this
accurately

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
um the law states the license shall
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
entitle the licensee to sell at retail
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
or wholesale only beverages manufactured
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
by the licensing and public building as
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 175 colon 1.
 
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.930 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 175 colon 1.
lv-a

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
lv-a
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
the net result of that is nano breweries
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
are having to pay the beverage
 
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
manufacturer licensing fee which is
 
00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
considerably more than the Nano Brewery
 
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
licensing fee because their facility is
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
not a distinctly separate building
 
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
in rural communities like Croydon
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of rental property or
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
other options for where to operate and
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
it is practical and wise from a business
 
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.250 align:start position:0%
it is practical and wise from a business
sense

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
for an inner Brewery to be able to
 
00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
operate in this way
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
um the Nano Brewery law was created to
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
help small breweries get started in the
 
00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
help small breweries get started in the
state

00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
I think collectively most folks would
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
agree that small business is good for
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I personally was a small
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
business owner until about two weeks ago
 
00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:08.220 align:start position:0%
I retired from a private practice as a
 
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.829 align:start position:0%
I retired from a private practice as a
dietitian

00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
dietitian
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
um and the laws that impact small
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
businesses make such a difference in our
 
00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
ability to operate and be profitable
 
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
ability to operate and be profitable
um

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
I think I'll stop there and with the
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee's consent
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
invite Chris Pros to speak further
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
sure good idea
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
all right thanks um
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
let me get closer to this
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
um yeah hello and thank you for allowing
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
me to speak on House Bill 167 my name is
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
Chris Prost I'm a veteran father and
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
small business owner
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
um my wife and I own polyculture brewing
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
and Croydon as representative Damon
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
mentioned so we're one of the smallest
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
breweries in the state we produce less
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
than 50 barrels of beer annually
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
and since our start four years ago we've
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
been unable to access the license that
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
seems like it was written for breweries
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
like ours the Nano Brewery license RSA
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's intended for breweries
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
producing less than 2 000 burials
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
annually and like I said we produce less
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
than 50. um and several other very small
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
breweries like ours are in the same
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
situation and I believe some have
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
submitted statements
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
um online
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
and yeah the Liquor Commission has
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
repeatedly cited the public building
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
language of this law which is what we're
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
trying to remove
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
um as the reason for not approving this
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
us for this license are peruse in a barn
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
that shares a wall with our house and is
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
on our property
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
so they've cited concerns about having a
 
00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:46.339 align:start position:0%
brewery in a residence but Federal
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
Regulations prohibit breweries and
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
dwellings and you have to comply with
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
Federal code to obtain a Federal
 
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
Brewer's permit which you need to
 
00:47:59.890 --> 00:47:59.900 align:start position:0%
abstain obtain a state permit
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
we have proper commercial insurance as
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
well as the permits and permission from
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
our town to operate but instead of being
 
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:09.020 align:start position:0%
licensed as a nano brewery we've been
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
forced to be licensed as a beverage
 
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer the same as the largest
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
breweries in the state
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and this is we've brought this issue
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
up several times since our initial
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
Licensing in 2018
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
um and I got I have an email from 2020
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
where another Brewery
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
opened um in a nearby Town operating out
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%
of their garage and they were able to
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
obtain a nano brewery license and when I
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
asked the Liquor Commission why you know
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
that was allowed but our situation
 
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.050 align:start position:0%
that was allowed but our situation
wasn't

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
um they stated that the commission is
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
ruled that the building on the property
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
a building on a property where people
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
live is their private residence if a
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
brewery is in a detached building on the
 
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.250 align:start position:0%
brewery is in a detached building on the
property

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:52.790 align:start position:0%
property
um

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
then it is not a private residence since
 
00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
no one resides
 
00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.309 align:start position:0%
no one resides
um

00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
so again there
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
using this idea that since there's an
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
attachment we are not a public building
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
but like I said there's been
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
inconsistent rulings on this in my mind
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
um so yeah the result of the different
 
00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
license is that we pay a higher
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
licensing fee of twelve hundred dollars
 
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:18.980 align:start position:0%
annually to be a beverage manufacturer
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
which is five times more expensive than
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
the Nano Brewery license fee which is
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
240 and it doesn't seem like a huge
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
difference in the overall scheme of
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
things but I'm sure any small business
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
owner would tell you that every dollar
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
counts especially in times like these
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
and added up over our four years of
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
existence it's almost four thousand
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
dollars extra paid and Licensing fees
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
which could have gone to equipment or
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
ingredients or expanding our operations
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
um aside from the monetary issue we also
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
miss out on opportunities that have been
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
made available to Nano breweries through
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
legislation because legislators
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
understandably assume that all small
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
breweries are Nanos in all beverage
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are large
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
um which in our you know in our instant
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
is definitely not the case so one
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
example is that we've been blocked from
 
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:09.980 align:start position:0%
hosting tastings with local wineries
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
that provision was only added to the
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
Nano Brewery law and not the beverage
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
um notably the public building language
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear in any other rsas
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
pertaining to alcohol Manufacturing in
 
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
the state including liquor liquor
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
manufacturing license wine manufacture
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
license beverage manufacturer or Brew
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
Pub license
 
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
so we're not sure why it's included in
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
this statute so removing the language
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
would put the decision for making the
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
decision-making for appropriate building
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
use back on the town or municipality
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
allowing for local control
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's particularly important because of
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
several other breweries that share our
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
situation most are in rural areas where
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
commercial property is limited towns
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
should be able to decide for themselves
 
00:50:58.609 --> 00:50:58.619 align:start position:0%
what operations can be conducted in
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
their buildings and support the startup
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
of small businesses there if they wish
 
00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:03.530 align:start position:0%
of small businesses there if they wish
to

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:05.890 --> 00:51:05.900 align:start position:0%
in closing I ask for you to support
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 167 by removing these few
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
words you will finally make the
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
nanoberry license to some of the
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
smallest breweries in the state as well
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
as restoring decisions to local
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank you for your time
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
and consideration
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
great thank you now normally I would do
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
as a chairman I would ask for questions
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
but in this case
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
um quote from a famous play I was in the
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.049 --> 00:51:36.059 align:start position:0%
is there access from the house into the
 
00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:37.569 align:start position:0%
is there access from the house into the
barn

00:51:37.569 --> 00:51:37.579 align:start position:0%
barn
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
there is there's an entrance but it's
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
padlocked with ttb which is federally
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
approved locks and permanently closed
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is what the federal statute
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
requires right so basically what the
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission is enforcing is is that the
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
intent was yes you could put it in a
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
garage assuming the garage was detached
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
that there was no access
 
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
capability going between the two in
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
particular the access would be by the
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
family who lives there
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
theoretically it's not your family it
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
could be a rented property so did they
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
ever say to you all you got to do is
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
take those locks off and block off that
 
00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
door and board up so that there's no
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
access between the house and the barn
 
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
did they ever tell you that no I mean
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
that was never presented as an option
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay that is what we heard in the
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
committee when this legislation was
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
passed that all it was supposed to do is
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is no access
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.930 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
may I
 
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.890 align:start position:0%
may I
so

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
on the surface that would solve the
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
problem but since the law is not being
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
enacted that way
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how my constituents should
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh we could certainly amend the statute
 
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess why we're pursuing just
 
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
full removal of the language is because
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear like I mentioned in
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
any other liquor manufacturing law in
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
the state so I'm just confused as to why
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
it should make a difference in this
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
because yeah that's a good question
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
because the expectation is in Nano is a
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
small operation and is tendency to do it
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
on next to their home and that that you
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
know a customer or you know a beverage
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is usually a much more
 
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
industrial much more and no one ever
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
when we we you know it's the devil's in
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
the details when we're writing up a
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
statute and then we didn't really think
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh you know how this problem
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
this problem came up only because we
 
00:53:57.890 --> 00:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
passed the Nano bill
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
and in that Nano Bill we knew this was
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
going to be a very small person who
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
would be operating this and the tendency
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
would be that they would use their
 
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.089 align:start position:0%
would be that they would use their
garage

00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
garage
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore that the intent the way
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
that language was written and I agree
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
with you that it's awkward that it's
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
using the phrase public building I agree
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
with that but um we can change that word
 
00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:22.700 align:start position:0%
too but at the end of the day the the
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
legislative intent what why we passed it
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
was to uphold the Federal
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
requirement 2 which is there has to be a
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
clear bifurcation of a resonance from
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
the operation
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess I just point out that the
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has no issue licensing
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
us as a beverage manufacturer in the
 
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
exact same space with the exact same
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
setup and additionally like I mentioned
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
the federal statute the ttb has approved
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
this solution in fact it's what they
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
recommend that's why they make these ttb
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
um approved locks this is the tobacco
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
tax and trade Bureau
 
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
um so I guess that's just I mean I don't
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
know what else to add aside from I'm
 
00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
just trying to present the picture
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's played out with us as I said
 
00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
there's other examples other breweries
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
that have run into the same situation
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
and I believe they've submitted
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
statements I'm not sure you know what
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
they've said or what they've presented
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
as their specific situation
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
fair enough yeah representative Ammon
 
00:55:32.569 --> 00:55:32.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you both for
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying I'm just looking
 
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:37.140 align:start position:0%
at the definition for public uh building
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
I just added here
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
very less sentenced as a public building
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
shall not be construed to meet a private
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
residence so in your mind would your
 
00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
space qualifies a private residence I'm
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
no I mean in my mind the private
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
residence is separate from the business
 
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.950 align:start position:0%
residence is separate from the business
space

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.089 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:55:59.089 --> 00:55:59.099 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
so if I may yes
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
speaking of someone who's been there
 
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's a barn
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
it's a nice Barn for a minute it has
 
00:56:16.569 --> 00:56:16.579 align:start position:0%
bathroom facilities in it right
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Keller
 
00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.309 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Keller
um

00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
if I'm to understand this with a private
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
residence and we take away and strip the
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
public building we're also stripping
 
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:34.140 align:start position:0%
some of the protections that are given
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
in that for people so if you're looking
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
at building code and we're looking
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
specifically here at building code from
 
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.670 align:start position:0%
specifically here at building code from
2018.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
um you're looking at
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make a residence also meet the
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
needs for a business or manufacturing
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
operation which is basically what a nano
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
brewery is a small manufacturing of
 
00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:58.670 align:start position:0%
brewery is a small manufacturing of
beverages

00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
beverages
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at protections my
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
is how are you going to protect that
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
residence if you know because they are
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to be protected
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
fire risks means of egress I can go on
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
and on I mean in our situation like and
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
I as I should I guess make clear we are
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
already licensed and operating as a
 
00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's and we've received
 
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:25.549 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's and we've received
um

00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
permits from the town including the fire
 
00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:28.970 align:start position:0%
permits from the town including the fire
department

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
um but to that specific case I mean just
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
to highlight our example our entire
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
properties like is insured commercially
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
um because obviously there are Insurance
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
questions like you're mentioning so it's
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
I mean obvious it's a complicated thing
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
um I mean that took a lot of figuring
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
out with the insurance and that sort of
 
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
thing so there are definitely
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
considerations like that but I feel that
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
we've met them but again I can't speak
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
to any other examples in the state or
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
their municipality
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
so the risks excuse me another question
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
further question so the risks are being
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
mitigated by other entities completely
 
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman it's a
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
clarification for me as either a nano
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
brewery or as a brewer manufacturer are
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
you required to sell on premises or
 
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
could you deliver and have all your
 
00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:36.609 align:start position:0%
could you deliver and have all your
sales

00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:36.619 align:start position:0%
sales
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
off-premises meaning that
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
um you're not having the liability of of
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
customers coming into the barn Etc et
 
00:58:44.819 --> 00:58:46.670 align:start position:0%
customers coming into the barn Etc et
cetera

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
um in our case
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
I mean I believe the law would allow
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
either to do both or you know either
 
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:54.410 align:start position:0%
either to do both or you know either
case

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and when we first got our start we
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
didn't have any
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
um public
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
the public couldn't come and do any
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
tastings at our location we were only
 
00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:03.530 align:start position:0%
tastings at our location we were only
doing

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
um stores and farmers markets and then
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
later we added a tasting area so I guess
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
in um as my in my understanding of the
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
laws it you could do either or with
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
either license but you're not required
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
to have people come on premises to buy
 
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:20.930 align:start position:0%
to have people come on premises to buy
it

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
is that correct the Assumption with
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
Indiana was that the absolutely would be
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
coming together I'm sorry I didn't hear
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
you the Assumption when we passed the
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
Nano legislation it was absolutely it
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
was intended that the customer is coming
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
into the facility to get to get that
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
that plant because that's where we went
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
the whole battle will be 1.2 pints and
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
versus the sample so no it was always
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
that was always the expectation but I
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
mean both license sorry yeah so at the
 
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
end of the day what this issue is that
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's amazing that we we do allow you to
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
become a customer you know a beverage
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
manufacturer notwithstanding so really
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the difference
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
comes down to is 420 difference in the
 
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:04.140 align:start position:0%
the licensor fee and that's what this is
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
about is that he's licensed as a nano
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
it's a different you know the license is
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
much cheaper than if you were a of a
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
regular custom
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I mean the difference is between
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars and two hundred
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
forty oh that's the whole license then
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and also like I said there's
 
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
been other
 
01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
been other
legislation

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
um that's been presented as it's helping
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
small breweries because it's going to
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
apply to Nano breweries
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and not beverage manufacture and
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
additionally I'd say there's also a
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
consumer aspect to it where people say
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
I mean nano brewery and some and I think
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
the overall definition in the industry
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean a specific license it just
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
means you're very small
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
um right so there's been something you
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
know there's questions where consumers
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
say oh you're a nano brewery
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
um and it's just a kind of strange thing
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
to be like no actually although we are
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
very small and we would be considered
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
one size wise we're technically not in
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
this state but that's kind of a right
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
not a huge impact
 
01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
okay representative Terry
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and Mr chairman I
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
do realize having served on this
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
committee uh uh for a long enough period
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
of time to recognize that we have
 
01:01:19.329 --> 01:01:19.339 align:start position:0%
recognized that there is no legislation
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh that is uh by its very nature perfect
 
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
and that we are in the process all the
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
time of reviewing how our legislation uh
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
affects people businesses and so forth
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
and are certainly open to uh
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
the process of perfecting or striving
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
for Perfection when it comes to
 
01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.530 align:start position:0%
for Perfection when it comes to
legislation

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the the question that I have as we
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
um apparently are in the process of
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
perfecting here or have an intent to
 
01:01:54.599 --> 01:01:55.789 align:start position:0%
perfecting here or have an intent to
perfect

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
with with an unintended consequence I am
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing how long you have
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
had the padlock
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
on the means of egress between the barn
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
and the house in fulfillment of the
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
federal requirement as I understand it
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
how long have you had that padlock on
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
and have there been any occasions on
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
which you have removed the padlock and
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
for what reasons and for length what
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I mean when we get issued the federal
 
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:29.630 align:start position:0%
um I mean when we get issued the federal
um

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
I mean there's kind of a hand in hand
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
process like you can have the federal
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
Brewers permit and not a local state one
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
so you can't actually produce but I mean
 
01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
from when the federal I mean basically
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
obtain the federal permit and then the
 
01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
state is in charge of kind of verifying
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'd say from when we had that
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
inspection from the State Liquor
 
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.049 align:start position:0%
inspection from the State Liquor
Commission

01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
um which you need to get the license
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of like one of the last
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
steps so since then
 
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:01.250 align:start position:0%
steps so since then
um

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean for the to undergo since
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
the licensing process
 
01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:09.299 align:start position:0%
um started until now the Lock's been in
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
place uh followed to be clear further
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
question you mean how long has the
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
padlock been on the door and have you
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
ever removed it and for what purpose and
 
01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
for what period of time
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so I guess since we got the license
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
in May 2018 I would say since then
 
01:03:27.839 --> 01:03:28.549 align:start position:0%
in May 2018 I would say since then
um

01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so the entire time we've been
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
licensed four years the padlock's been
 
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
on the door yes and you haven't removed
 
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.630 align:start position:0%
on the door yes and you haven't removed
it

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.470 align:start position:0%
it
um

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
feed the best of your knowledge yes to
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge thank you very
 
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.450 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge thank you very
much

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
are there any differences in
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
requirements uh such as safety or
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
accessibility requirements between the
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
requirements for the beverage
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and the requirements for
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
the Nano Brewery
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh well what I'd say is currently the I
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
think the only main difference is that
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
the nanobi has this language that States
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
it must be in a public building the
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer law doesn't
 
01:04:15.609 --> 01:04:15.619 align:start position:0%
contain any language of that type
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
so in my interpretation it would be
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
I guess this the Nano Brewery it seems
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
like there's an extra layer where the
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
state is having a a weighing in on that
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
sort of thing whereas these other

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
sorry and sorry for the uh last minute
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh card uh as most of you know uh for
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Mark armaganian
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
I'm the director and chief of liquor
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:59.030 --> 01:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman what we're uh our
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
reservation is really built around
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
um not knowing exactly
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
if by removing this phrase what
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
other potential challenges we face
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
by businesses who acquire a nano license
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
and then may wish to actually move it
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
into their home into their residence
 
01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
possibly into their basement we don't
 
01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:29.339 align:start position:0%
really know what the scenarios are and
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
therefore Our concern is that by
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
removing this we really have no
 
01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
measurable standard by which to evaluate
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
an application and issue a license
 
01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.010 align:start position:0%
an application and issue a license
um

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
we have reached out to the sponsor of
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
the bill to try to see what we could do
 
01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
to resolve the questions that are part
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the enforcement and
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
Licensing Division has reached out to
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
the licensee uh in an attempt to revisit
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.130 align:start position:0%
the facility
to

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether the appropriate license
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
is issued
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
and so we're always as the chief has
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned repeatedly looking to work
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
with the industry to resolve issues that
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
present themselves and help a small
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
business to continue to function and
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
operate within the state
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
so would you
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
like to say anything uh yeah thank you
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
um also
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
um on that note
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
um there were attempts uh uh to actually
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
go out to this premise
 
01:07:43.319 --> 01:07:43.970 align:start position:0%
go out to this premise
um

01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
as as I've testified over the last six
 
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.950 align:start position:0%
as as I've testified over the last six
years

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
um this is a process with liquor
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement licensing of trying to do it
 
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
better than the previous year
 
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
um and and we are finding things as we
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
go along that need to be fixed and
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's a bill in front of you that is a
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
cleanup Bill to fix stuff
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
um with that in mind
 
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
um uh as the licensee uh uh testified to
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
there was an interpretation issue here
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
um uh an interpretation issue that at
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
times you've seen me go
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
why aren't we
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and but at the same time we ran into
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
just recently and and I can be corrected
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong uh but we wanted to go out
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
to the license establishment to put eyes
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and and that was uh that was received
 
01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.669 align:start position:0%
um and and that was uh that was received
reluctantly

01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
reluctantly
 
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
um I I do have a personal
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
um and professional uh position on the
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
privacy of our citizens of the state
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so when it comes to Residents and
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
dwellings and and I'm a regulatory
 
01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:04.870 align:start position:0%
dwellings and and I'm a regulatory
Division

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
Division
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want me in your
 
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.990 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want me in your
house

01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
um to be quite honest about it
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
um when my job is to regulate this
 
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
industry and and that's a little
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
different coming from somebody like me
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
um where uh you know we we look at this
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
we look at this as we
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
um there could be a possible safety
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
issue here because we have to bring fire
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
in that was a great question uh
 
01:09:32.219 --> 01:09:33.370 align:start position:0%
in that was a great question uh
representative

01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:33.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
but at the same time there are other
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved here that
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
um to include the municipality to
 
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
include uh ttb which of course
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
is is the oversight at the federal level
 
01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.570 align:start position:0%
is is the oversight at the federal level
so

01:09:50.570 --> 01:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
um we we have tried to resolve this we
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
believe that there is another bill out
 
01:09:59.930 --> 01:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
there that actually resolves this issue
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
um coming from the Senate
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and and I think CJ is here that could
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
speak more on that because it's from the
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
association uh but uh again reluctantly
 
01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
nothing wanted to be done with this bill
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
when it was brought to everybody's
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
attention that there's a bill out there
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
that could clean this all up
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong on that I stand to be
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
correct glad to hear that you realize
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem here and we need
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
to get this cleaned up
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
yet representative Sullivan
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that you said one
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that could occur would
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
be potentially people would be going
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
into their basements or other parts of
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
their house uh if if I took the previous
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
testimonies seriously which is the that
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
would be against the law at the federal
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
level wouldn't it would it not that was
 
01:10:58.130 --> 01:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
my understanding of what I just heard
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
if the business resides in the residence
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
and there's a statutory obligation to
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
regulate whether it's from a safety
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
level or from a from an enforcement
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
level a regulatory level
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
um we have the right to go into that
 
01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:20.030 align:start position:0%
um we have the right to go into that
residence

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
residence
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
right so for the question for the
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
question my my question however though
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
is if if having a brewery operation in a
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
dwelling is prohibited under federal law
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
then what is the purpose of a of a this
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
wording as it is with the Public Public
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh well it has to be a public building
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of that if if a
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
private dwelling is already forbidden
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
under federal law in addition if you
 
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.450 align:start position:0%
under federal law in addition if you
have

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
the ability to do all of what they're
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
doing currently because he has a
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
different type of license right so he's
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
doing what he wants to do he's just not
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
getting the Nano classification which is
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
what he wants I'm I'm struggling to
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
understand the need for this like I I
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
would like to know what true risk there
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
are of having this I can actually answer
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
this question
 
01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:09.620 align:start position:0%
since I was in the room when it happened
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
and this discussion about the basement
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
came up
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
and the discussion was
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
if the hot water heater
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
is used is in the basement
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
and the hot water heater has a repair
 
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.390 align:start position:0%
and the hot water heater has a repair
problem

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
how is the resonance going to get in
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
there without you know having some
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
access into that separate space so that
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
the conversation was around the purpose
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
of this statute that the purpose as far
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
as I know is the federal statute is that
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
there is a the bifurcation is there is
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
no shared services
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
in other words you can't use if you can
 
01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
have a bathroom which we're going to
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
talk about next maybe you have the
 
01:12:52.669 --> 01:12:52.679 align:start position:0%
bathroom the bathroom has got to be in
 
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
the barn you can't have he can't say you
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
can go in the house to get to the
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
bathroom so the key element maybe is
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
that you know the basement is an example
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
of how uh and I guess it is possible
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
that the hot water heater for the house
 
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
is in the barn there would be a problem
 
01:13:12.770 --> 01:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
okay so the key element is the way the
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
way I remember how this was laid out for
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
us is it has to be really stand alone it
 
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
has to not that the two Services cannot
 
01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
intermingle so the the electric the
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
electricity for instance
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
the electric it would have to have a
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
separate electric meter
 
01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
fund the residence
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
I'm I understand what you're saying I
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I I'm still struggling
 
01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.169 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I I'm still struggling
though

01:13:38.169 --> 01:13:38.179 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
why this only would apply to Nano and
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
not like why can you do manufacturing
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
that's a good question because uh yeah
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
what happened was is that is that when
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh when we were doing uh we've always
 
01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:52.100 align:start position:0%
had the beverage manufacturer license
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
and uh beverage manufacturer license it
 
01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
does the same thing as Nano which is
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
that you first you have to have the
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
federal license before you can get the
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
state license
 
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
so since it was required on the federal
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
license no one ever thought twice about
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
it when it came to Nano that was I would
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
say there was uh some of the pushback
 
01:14:12.719 --> 01:14:13.970 align:start position:0%
say there was uh some of the pushback
from

01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
let's say uh beverage manufacturers
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
other people there was a pushback and
 
01:14:20.930 --> 01:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
they were saying you know let's really
 
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that that Federal concept is
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
really enforced because everyone's well
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
we had perceived what a nano was going
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
to be was basically someone who was
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
making beer himself or herself at home
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then decided they want to now they
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
want to sell it and so that they would
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
still be doing it at home
 
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
and that was war that where we came into
 
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
feeling compelled to add this paragraph
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know into the statute to really make
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
sure that that you know that federal law
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
was understood and kind of give the give
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
some meat to the bones so that's yes
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's a fluke and this representative
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
says it's just part of the process when
 
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
you do legislation and that's you know
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
this was a piece of sausage that was
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
kind of thrown in while while it was
 
01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
being done representative Gibbs
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
um for clarification again uh
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
and this is I guess you know a two-part
 
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.689 align:start position:0%
and this is I guess you know a two-part
question

01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
does the federal law in fact prohibit
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
operating a brewery in a dwelling and if
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is is the case
 
01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
is it possible that
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
anyone could legally under federal law
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
operate a brewery in the basement of the
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
dwelling and then I guess the third part
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
is if if
 
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
in fact it's impossible would there ever
 
01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
be a need to go into a dwelling to
 
01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
inspect the basement
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
I hope that's clear and if it that if
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
it's not clear please ask me to clarify
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question
 
01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.649 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your question
representative

01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I cannot state with certainty what
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
the federal law is and of course under
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
title 13
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
the commission as representative hunt
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
pointed out because he's been here a
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
long time long time
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
um you've been here longer
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
is is that the Nano Brewery is was an
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
extension of what was a what is allowed
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire law for any
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
one of you who decide you want to brew
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
at your house you want you decide this
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
and interest to you you can Brew up I
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
believe it's 200 gallons and the
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
industry then to said look we want to
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
provide a pathway for these people who
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
really have taken this passion and to
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
allow them to get into business
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
and by doing so the Nano license was
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
created to give them a path again with
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
limited production levels
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
and the separateness was there because
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
as the chairman said
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
most of these businesses started out of
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
their house and the conversion from a
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
home recreational
 
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:01.550 align:start position:0%
home recreational
Hobby

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hobby
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
to a business
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
now brings in a number of other
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
considerations alcohol as as you can
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
well imagine in the Supreme Court of the
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
United States has said so is a highly
 
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
regulated commodity and as a result of
 
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
being a highly rig related commodity it
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
is subject to
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable searches by the agency that
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
oversees it to conduct inspections to
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
make sure there's compliance
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
so therefore
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement the chief and his staff
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to make a to make an
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
appearance at at a licensed Nano Brewery
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
knowing that it is subject to reasonable
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
regulation under the administrative
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
procedure act and administrative search
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.630 align:start position:0%
procedure act and administrative search
warrants

01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
warrants
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
to inspect it if it were in a home
 
01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
well the courts have spoken very clearly
 
01:18:01.729 --> 01:18:01.739 align:start position:0%
about what it takes to get law
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement into a home without exigent
 
01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
circumstances you need a warrant you got
 
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
to get in there on a warrant unless
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
somebody lets you in
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
and it's just as easy that any homeowner
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
could say no I don't know sorry come
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
back with a warrant and to avoid that
 
01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.169 align:start position:0%
back with a warrant and to avoid that
rub

01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
rub
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
I believe this the legislature the
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
legislature put in this public building
 
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
aspect for this particular licensee
 
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
because of its path on growth from
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
a home hobby to commercialization
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and that's why it is there
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
now it's my understanding and I may be
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
wrong that this gentleman has a separate
 
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.370 align:start position:0%
wrong that this gentleman has a separate
lease

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
and and if so that that takes it into
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
another commercial range which I believe
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
is what the chief
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
and his staff were going to evaluate
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
to re-look at this issue
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
evaluate it and see what key thing is to
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
look at it what is the Senate bill
 
01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.390 align:start position:0%
look at it what is the Senate bill
number

01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
yeah right now it's just an LSR LSR
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:20.300 align:start position:0%
Lang okay
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
further questions okay further question
 
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
may inquire
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh again for clarification
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman who testified earlier
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
um who operates the Brewer in his barn
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
has a license as a beverage manufacturer
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh but he has been denied a license as a
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
nano brewery
 
01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:45.860 align:start position:0%
could you clarify why it's acceptable
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
for him to have a license as a beverage
 
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but not as a nano Brewer
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
considering that the circumstances are
 
01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:56.350 align:start position:0%
considering that the circumstances are
identical

01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
identical
 
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative and I think it's a great
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
question and one that I want to
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to personally resolve
 
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
you you have a very legitimate question
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know until I look at it and when
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
I look at it it might fulfill the
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
obligation of what is a nano brewery
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
the gentleman's fees will go down from
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars twelve hundred
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
and change down to 240. that quite that
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
that is very accurate testimony and but
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
not putting eyes on that location
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
prohibits me from making that decision
 
01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
and I I want to clean that and again
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
those of you that know the reason why I
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
came here six years ago and and what my
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
job has been tasked to do
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
these are things that I've been tasked
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
to do and that's to fix this stuff so
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a more polished term
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so uh this could be one of them I
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
don't know I haven't gone down there I
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to go down there personally I want
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
to go down there and I've done that
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
please collect correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
here I'm trying to understand the
 
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
purpose of these Provisions as I
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
understand it the purpose of the Nano
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
Brewery statute
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
is in part to alleviate the difficulties
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
of the search and seizure provision for
 
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission if there were to
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
be a brewery in a home correct
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
I mean go ahead
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's the purpose uh
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
could you restate your question please
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least in part the Nano Brewery
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
provision alleviates some of the search
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
and seizure difficulties if there were
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
for the Liquor Commission or other
 
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement if there were to be a
 
01:21:53.450 --> 01:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
brewery in a home is that correct
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
it we would look at it probably in
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
reverse that if you were an applicant
 
01:22:02.570 --> 01:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
for for the license we would say is this
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
facility that you're intending to have
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
your Brewing operation in a public
 
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:08.030 align:start position:0%
your Brewing operation in a public
building

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
and if the answer is no it's not then
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
under the current statute you would be
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.649 --> 01:22:20.659 align:start position:0%
what do you see then as being the
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
legislative purpose of this statute
 
01:22:24.719 --> 01:22:25.850 align:start position:0%
legislative purpose of this statute
but

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
if it is not trying to achieve then that
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
public good of eliminating the search
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
and seizure problem for the Liquor
 
01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:38.630 align:start position:0%
and seizure problem for the Liquor
Commission

01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.199 --> 01:22:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
looking at this from a historical
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
perspective and and unfortunately I've
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
been around long enough to see a lot of
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the history as it's kind of built up
 
01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:56.780 align:start position:0%
I was not working I'm a former
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
enforcement member I spent 25 years with
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
the commission uh the last 10 as the
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
chief I don't I was not present when the
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
Nano license was created so
 
01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not privy to some of the
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
conversations that took place but the
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
Nano license was not created to avoid
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
a search and seizure issue
 
01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:18.729 align:start position:0%
a search and seizure issue
um

01:23:18.729 --> 01:23:18.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
the the Nano license was created to give
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
a pathway to the home Brewer
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
to get into the commercial Market if
 
01:23:30.169 --> 01:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
they wished and therefore by entering
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
into that commercial Market they are now
 
01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:35.900 align:start position:0%
subject to the reasonable regulation
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
that comes with holding a license
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
to sell alcohol in New Hampshire
 
01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
to sell alcohol in New Hampshire
so

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
with that the reasonable regulation does
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the commission has in its statutes
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
the requirement to do inspections and to
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
ensure title 13 is in compliance so
 
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.910 align:start position:0%
ensure title 13 is in compliance so
um

01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
the the statute
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the fact that it moves it
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
to a public building kind of avoids this
 
01:24:07.130 --> 01:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
issue of search and seizure out of a
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
residence because we wouldn't permit
 
01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
that to be licensed in a private
 
01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:13.490 align:start position:0%
that to be licensed in a private
residence

01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
residence
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
I hope I've answered your question as a
 
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up if the licensee were to hold
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
out that a particular portion of a
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
building for example that was padlocked
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
off at Barn for example that was
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
padlocked off from the rest of the
 
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.850 align:start position:0%
padlocked off from the rest of the
building

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
was the brewery
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
what search and seizure difficulties
 
01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:35.300 align:start position:0%
that does that hold off for the
 
01:24:39.290 --> 01:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
commission to only search that area and
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
no other area
 
01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.470 align:start position:0%
no other area
the

01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
no two businesses that sell alcohol in
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are alike none of them
 
01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
none of them uh my experience has been
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
you talked to 100 people and they're all
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to have their own business models
 
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to have their own idea
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
what things look like where they're
 
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
going to be how it's going to run
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
everything that we do in the way of
 
01:25:10.729 --> 01:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
licensure is an independent review of
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
the facts and circumstances that present
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
themselves at the time of application
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
so if if the gentleman
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
is going to get a license then we would
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
be looking at what are the facts and
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances looking at the statute
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
what does the statute require what does
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
it prohibit and then running through
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
that checklist literally a checklist
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
that says yes no yes no and then based
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
upon what is at the end will come a
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the enforcement
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
division whether to license or not
 
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:45.980 align:start position:0%
license from the commission
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
I someone made the interpretation that
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
this business was not eligible for a
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
nano brewery license
 
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.630 align:start position:0%
nano brewery license
but

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
took the next step which seems to be
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
much more costly to get them into a
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
business license that they were eligible
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
and there were no limitations on and
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
that is the beverage manufacturer
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
license so rather than just say no
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
you can't get this license period
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
well you can't get this license but we
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
do have another pathway for you now is
 
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
that the right pathway well you've heard
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
the chief say he's going to check that
 
01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
out make sure that that's been explored
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to get this fixed
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
always fix it sir always
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
a question and of course yes
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:34.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
about

01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
building if the built Barn is on his
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
property I don't understand how that can
 
01:26:43.729 --> 01:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
public building
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
if the public is probably the wrong word
 
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
yes it was the wrong word but that was
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
just what we were doing when we were
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
making sausage
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
I think it has to do with availability
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives okay who can get there
 
01:26:59.090 --> 01:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
and if the property owner wants to allow
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
someone onto their property without
 
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:03.780 align:start position:0%
restriction to come to their facility
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
then I think that would be the
 
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
requirement we're looking forward to
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
getting this resolved very quickly so
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
that when when the license is renewed he
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
can renew himself as a nano
 
01:27:18.169 --> 01:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
all right one more card CJ

evening

01:27:42.729 --> 01:27:42.739 align:start position:0%

please make sure your mic's on and you

talk closely thank you thank you good
 
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
morning my name is CJ Haynes and I am
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the New
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Brewers Association I
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
currently represent over 90 breweries in
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.250 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
uh

01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:00.890 --> 01:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
we have proposed a bill that I believe
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
will create a solution for this problem
 
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
entirely and it will also help the
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission from their standpoint
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
and it'll also help a number of other
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
breweries in the state that fall into
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
this category of perhaps what we'll say
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
is mislicensed as a beverage
 
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
manufacturer instead of their true
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
intended Nano license
 
01:28:25.729 --> 01:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
and the bill that we are proposing uh is
 
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
actually in LSR right now and the
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
language is being finalized today and
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh and one of the provisions of
 
01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:35.060 align:start position:0%
that bill is to actually
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
repeal the Nano license and add two
 
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
tiers to the beverage manufacturer
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
license which would mean that there
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
would be a tier for zero to 500 barrels
 
01:28:48.649 --> 01:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
annual production for the 240 dollars
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
price of a nano current and then there
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
would also be another tier that would be
 
01:28:57.169 --> 01:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
added for 500 to 2500 barrels so what
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
this would alleviate is as a small
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
Brewery grows that Brewery would not
 
01:29:03.890 --> 01:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
have to be subjected to having to change
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
their license back and forth between a
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
nano and a beverage manufacturer at the
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
continuity would be they would start as
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer therefore none
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
of the issue with the public building
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
would be part of the issue because that
 
01:29:19.149 --> 01:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
is not in RSA
 
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
17812 as a beverage manufacturer as
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
we've discussed already this morning the
 
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
other is that this bill will clean up
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
any of the the numerous licenses that
 
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
are out there and not to over complicate
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
it but when you have a nano then you can
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
apply for a restaurant license you get a
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
nano plus and it gets overly complicated
 
01:29:40.729 --> 01:29:40.739 align:start position:0%
in that so the efforts of this bill
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's being put forth is to streamline
 
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
the licensing reduce the number of
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
licenses and actually clean up some of
 
01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
the clerical issues that you see here
 
01:29:49.139 --> 01:29:51.050 align:start position:0%
the clerical issues that you see here
today

01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
excellent idea thank you for your help
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
modeled along what we've done in the
 
01:29:59.570 --> 01:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
past which is with the other Industries
 
01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
we have changed have a a light light
 
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
license and we did that with uh
 
01:30:06.169 --> 01:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
obviously distilled this past year so
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
that's great I will further that uh two
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
years ago we proposed SB 125 which took
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
many of these issues that separated
 
01:30:17.450 --> 01:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
between the two license so that was the
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
first stage of the process and this
 
01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
would finalize the rest of that which
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
was the original tent two to three years
 
01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:25.139 align:start position:0%
ago was to already merge the Nano into a
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer Mr chairman great
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
idea we do have a question yes
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has a question
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
um is it my understanding correct that
 
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:36.290 align:start position:0%
um is it my understanding correct that
uh

01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:38.810 --> 01:30:38.820 align:start position:0%
the difficulty
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
um hinged upon
 
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
search and seizure laws in other words
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
now that was just a sideline to the
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
whole story well he was he was asked if
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
he could
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
he said no correct correct so I I uh if
 
01:31:01.129 --> 01:31:01.139 align:start position:0%
you do these other laws and and whatnot
 
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:04.139 align:start position:0%
um is that still going to be a problem I
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
will comment um is in my conversations
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
the bill that we are pushing forward we
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
have spoken with the Liquor Commission
 
01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
and they're working with us on the
 
01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
language and one of those items is that
 
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
of consideration is that no extension of
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
service area is issued to someone unless
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
it is a permissible place of public
 
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
entry so therefore a brewery would never
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
be issued a license if there wasn't con
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
deemed a public building that was
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public therefore the
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission would only have the
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
right to inspect the area that is the
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
extension of service area which would
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
is he had a right to say no you can't
 
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
come in correct because he his extension
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
of service area is only permitted in the
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
brewery itself
 
01:31:59.090 --> 01:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
and that's the only area that the Liquor
 
01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
Commission for enforcement standpoint
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
the other well that in my mind anyway
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
um that brings front and center the
 
01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
issue of uh safety
 
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:19.580 align:start position:0%
if if
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
I I understand uh the distinct you're
 
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:26.900 align:start position:0%
making a distinction if with the new LSR
 
01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't solve the problem of
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
safety in other words is his facility
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
safe and and we would only find out one
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
day when the place burned down
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
so I mean I I still have a problem I
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
mean I would I would have just said uh
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
yes here's the here's the that's that's
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
a would you believe would you believe
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
yeah would you believe that you would
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
have just you still have a problem yes
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
okay so there you are you don't have to
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
answer would you believe great thank you
 
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:02.780 align:start position:0%
very much representative
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if that bill uh who the
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of that bill is that is
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
Senator Lane okay thank you further I
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
will say with there was another issue
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
that um the Nano Chris brought up
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
earlier is that the bill would also
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
include language to incorporate all of
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
the things that a nano can currently do
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
that a beverage manufacturer cannot do
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
we've taken that into consideration and
 
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
it will be added to the bill so
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
therefore the sampling at a winery will
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
be added to the beverage manufacturer
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
hence why it's taking a little while to
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
sort through all these different courses
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
I've always said our laws are very
 
01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
Byzantine when it comes to sorting it
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
out so that's great thank you very much
 
01:33:49.970 --> 01:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and we'll we'll look for
 
01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
I will contact uh Senator Lang and thank
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
you get a copy of what he's got what
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
he's working on
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
all right having no more cards we'll
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
close that public hearing
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
and move right into house bill 173
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
relative to toilet facilities provided
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:15.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:34:15.490 --> 01:34:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
signed in in support of the bill
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
Kathy Pernell
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
Katie okay now
 
01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
Israel yeah yeah she also was in support
 
01:34:36.649 --> 01:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
Okay so
foreign

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
did you fill out a car
 
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
no because I didn't know that the prime
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
sponsor had to I can do that
 
01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
you can do it afterwards yes okay
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
you've been around before right
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
years ago years ago we had pink cards
 
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:03.380 align:start position:0%
back then you did
 
01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
sorry okay introduce yourself please and
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Dan Hines representing uh
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
Bedford thank you chairman hunt uh so
 
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill I put it in before
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
I got passed through the house on
 
01:35:17.209 --> 01:35:17.219 align:start position:0%
consent so hopefully we get the same
 
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:19.380 align:start position:0%
result this time but it's simple Bell so
 
01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.110 align:start position:0%
result this time but it's simple Bell so
presently

01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
presently
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um under the law
 
01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
um a restaurant having 25 or more people
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
need both a male and a female restaurant
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
or sorry a bathroom not sure what the
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
original intent behind that was but my
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
intent in repealing that is people our
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants would still have to have
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
adequate bathrooms for everyone however
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
this would allow them to have either
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
unisex bathrooms or family bathrooms so
 
01:35:46.129 --> 01:35:46.139 align:start position:0%
it's not requiring it on businesses if
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
businesses like their one male and one
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
female bathroom have it um but I think
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
it's better to give more opportunity
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
um of choices for restaurants I think
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
some restaurants might want a family
 
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
bathroom or like I said a unisex
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
bathroom so this isn't requiring or this
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
isn't removing requirements actually
 
01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
have bathrooms and just giving
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
businesses more options of who they're
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
going to allow in their bathrooms
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
and since this committee did pass a
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that either bathroom or
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
whatever bathrooms they still have to
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay any questions
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
from representative Heinz yeah
 
01:36:27.610 --> 01:36:27.620 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly Brown
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
collabro collabro
 
01:36:31.199 --> 01:36:31.729 align:start position:0%
collabro collabro
OK

01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
OK
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so my question is um the way this is
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
worded uh it says 25 or more the current
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
building code does permit in an
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
amendment to this particular building
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
code that permits what used to be 15 now
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
to go up to 25. if we're to look at the
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
building code it is very specific to the
 
01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
use of it which you have as an assembly
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
use and restaurant
 
01:37:00.610 --> 01:37:00.620 align:start position:0%
but what it then gets into is how many
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
occupants would be in in the place and
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
that includes employees
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
so in New England you have old buildings
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
um if we are to create just one bathroom
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
which is what you're saying
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
um unisex or multi whomever gets to use
 
01:37:21.770 --> 01:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
it you have no limit
 
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay so my question then becomes the way
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's stated it's basically to 75 and
 
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
under you must have one restroom for
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
each gender
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
if you are to expand that restart and
 
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
you only have one restroom for question
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
mark there's no limit in this bill
 
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you're going to enter in hygiene
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
issues and risk issues what limit would
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
so I guess it wasn't the number that was
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
the issue to me it was the my particular
 
01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
issue was you have to have one male and
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
one female bathroom I think so that
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
would be two I think if from your
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
perspective of number of people would be
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
the same amount if I had two unisex
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
bathrooms follow-up question please
 
01:38:10.850 --> 01:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire
 
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:11.870 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire
um

01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:14.699 align:start position:0%
the code actually states that one of
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
those two may be
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
Universal basically then you can state
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
that either of those two restrooms can
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
be a universal restroom and they're
 
01:38:25.250 --> 01:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
currently doing that in a lot of places
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
it's a choice so they've already made
 
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
Provisions for that
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
so the extent that this conflicts with
 
01:38:32.219 --> 01:38:33.110 align:start position:0%
so the extent that this conflicts with
code

01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't know which one would overrule
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would leave that to someone
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable but I know I believe
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
this to be an issue I don't know
 
01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly figure that one out in
 
01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly figure that one out in
subcommittee

01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
 
01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions from committee
members

01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's it okay thank you I'll fill out
 
01:39:00.290 --> 01:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
the pink card
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so Philip
 
01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:08.930 align:start position:0%
thank you so Philip
Sherman

01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
he's a building code inspector so he can
 
01:39:13.209 --> 01:39:13.219 align:start position:0%
tell us the answer that question
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
Bingo thank you very much in support of
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and you want to turn that mic
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
on so red is good red is good red is
 
01:39:22.490 --> 01:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
good and then you want to talk closely
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
let me go through my presentation and I
 
01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:28.980 align:start position:0%
may or may not answer your question we
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
can come back to it though so I speak
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
today as chair of the State Building
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
Code review board for those of you who
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
may not know our charges to develop and
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
maintain the state building code for
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
ratification by the by the legislature
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'll note that due to my late awareness
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
of this hearing I have not had a chance
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
to discuss my views with with any of the
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
DHHS Representatives but I fully hope to
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
have time to do that I'll start by
 
01:39:58.810 --> 01:39:58.820 align:start position:0%
asking us to recall that RSA 155 a210
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
prohibits state agencies from varying
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
modifying or waiving the requirements of
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code well some
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
members of other legislative committees
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
are aware that the bcrb and the Myriad
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
state agencies have a lot of work to do
 
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
on this we have been trying with some
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
success to deal with specific Provisions
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
as they come up that's why I'm here
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
today my specific comments on RSA 1 5540
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
and the proposed changes are as follows
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
first the State Building Code requires
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
places where food is served to be
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
provided with restrooms for new
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
construction when some alterations occur
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
and if the Food Service occupancy is
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
created by changing from another
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
occupancy the code requires the
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
customers and employees have access to
 
01:40:48.530 --> 01:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
these restrooms and set specific
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
distance limitations
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
the first sentence of this section as it
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
as it's currently written basically
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
requires restrooms and adds the
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
requirement that restrooms be convenient
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
which is a subjective term
 
01:41:05.090 --> 01:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
portion of the RSA proposed to be
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
deleted eliminates the requirement that
 
01:41:10.189 --> 01:41:10.199 align:start position:0%
restrooms be provided for each sex in
 
01:41:13.010 --> 01:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
small facilities but also eliminates the
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
requirement that separate sex facilities
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
be provided anywhere where alcohol is
 
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.189 align:start position:0%
be provided anywhere where alcohol is
served

01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
the building code has evolved on this
 
01:41:23.689 --> 01:41:23.699 align:start position:0%
issue as society's opinions have changed
 
01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
over time and to some extent the 2018
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
model code currently in effect into a
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
more complete extent the 2021 model code
 
01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
now under review by the bcrb eliminates
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
most requirements for separate sex
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
facilities it permits them but it won't
 
01:41:43.129 --> 01:41:43.139 align:start position:0%
require them
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
I would note that the current New
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire code has an amendment as
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously coordinating the
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
requirement for separate sex facilities
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
with the 25 person limit in the section
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
proposed to be deleted that was put in
 
01:41:58.729 --> 01:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
to be uh to coordinate with this very
 
01:41:58.739 --> 01:42:03.590 align:start position:0%
to be uh to coordinate with this very
section

01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
also current House Bill 104 grapples
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
with this issue in schools where they're
 
01:42:13.129 --> 01:42:13.139 align:start position:0%
proposing to prohibit the use of all
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
essentially what it referred to as all
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
gender facilities so we'll see where
 
01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:20.780 align:start position:0%
the last section of the current RSA
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
15540 provides limited approval for the
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS commissioner to weigh the
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
requirements of this section if the bill
 
01:42:30.590 --> 01:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
is passed as proposed the section
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
remaining basically consists of the
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide restrooms this
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
clearly conflicts with the State
 
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
Building Code which may require
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
restrooms in certain circumstances
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
I'll conclude by noting that RSA 15540
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
which was originally implemented in 1935
 
01:42:51.530 --> 01:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
long before the implementation of modern
 
01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
codes and standards it's been modified
 
01:42:56.930 --> 01:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
over time occasionally the provisions in
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
this section are well covered by the FDA
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
Food Code which is adopted by DHHS and
 
01:43:05.209 --> 01:43:05.219 align:start position:0%
the state building code and the
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
authority to provide waivers variances
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
modification of the requirements or the
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
use of alternative methods to the
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
respective regulations have approval
 
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:16.940 align:start position:0%
channels through other dhhf
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS and Building Code Enforcement
 
01:43:22.689 --> 01:43:22.699 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are currently in effect
 
01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
therefore I not only speak in favor of
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
deleting the proposed portion of the RSA
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
but recommend that you consider deletion
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
of the entire
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
155-40 section ah somebody agrees with
 
01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:38.219 align:start position:0%
me again I wouldn't hope that we'd be
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
given time to discuss this with DHHS as
 
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
time for review and reflection May
 
01:43:44.450 --> 01:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
identify something that I'm missing
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for permitting me to speak
 
01:43:48.609 --> 01:43:48.619 align:start position:0%
with you today
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's great
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you chairman just a
 
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
very uh quick question
 
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
um and maybe this goes to the previous
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
speaker of
 
01:44:08.590 --> 01:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
when you talk about a unisex or family
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
uh facility in a restaurant you're
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
talking about a one-person use facility
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
is that correct it's not a multiple
 
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
people with multiple stalls it's just
 
01:44:22.129 --> 01:44:22.139 align:start position:0%
one person right the term that the code
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
is starting to colless around a single
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
user unisex has always been a strange
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
little term but it's floated around so
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
single user multiple user uh there as
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
you may know there's a European style of
 
01:44:39.970 --> 01:44:39.980 align:start position:0%
restroom which is all gender
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
harder stalls lavatories in the middle
 
01:44:45.709 --> 01:44:45.719 align:start position:0%
I've been in them they're very used to
 
01:44:46.850 --> 01:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
them over there
 
01:44:50.450 --> 01:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
the folks on HB 104 don't care for that
 
01:44:52.609 --> 01:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
the proponents so we'll see where that
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
all goes but the code as it's written
 
01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
would would permit that unless it's
 
01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.250 align:start position:0%
would would permit that unless it's
amended

01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
amended
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
any other questions any other questions
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
if you could provide the testimony to
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
the yeah that would be great clerk loves
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
okay so uh one of the advantages of
 
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
being around so long I know I could see
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
who's in the room so Colleen Smith from
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:27.229 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
we have has visited Us in past years
 
01:45:37.010 --> 01:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you and I plan to
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
attend just in case there were questions
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
that came up for for our department so
 
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
we are not taking a position on this
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
bill we I would be
 
01:45:52.729 --> 01:45:52.739 align:start position:0%
um amenable to striking this part of the
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
statute as Mr Sherman had stated we we
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
definitely generally do defer to
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
building code when it comes to restroom
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
requirements as it was mentioned before
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
this I believe this is a very old or
 
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
older statute before in existence before
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
before building codes existed so we um
 
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
we do have the food code which does
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
reference state law which would defer to
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
building code so we have no issue with
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
striking this part of the statute as
 
01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:22.070 align:start position:0%
striking this part of the statute as
well

01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
music to our ears
 
01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:27.109 align:start position:0%
music to our ears
okay

01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay

Mike you know you want to be all set
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%

01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
testify and House Bill 173 saying none
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%

01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
it's amazing how that works
 
01:46:52.380 --> 01:47:04.090 align:start position:0%
it's amazing how that works
timing

01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.970 --> 01:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
okay well I I you never know how long
 
01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
39 degrees
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%

members I have scheduled for next
 
01:48:05.689 --> 01:48:05.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
and because science and technology is
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%

Wednesday and Thursday uh if you go
 
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
and it is official that we did get
 
01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:26.810 align:start position:0%
and it is official that we did get
um

01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:37.310 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
so and um I I I don't like I don't want
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm am Monday Mondays are a problem
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm on the county delegation
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
until like I can't do Mondays anyways
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
and I and it's scheduling things on
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
Friday it's just an anathema to me so uh
 
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'm being prepared that I might actually
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
uh if I feel need to squeeze things in
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we would start at nine rather than
 
01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:20.470 align:start position:0%
that we would start at nine rather than
ten

01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
my motivations is is really just to keep
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
us on on uh on Wednesday Thursday
 
01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.430 align:start position:0%
us on on uh on Wednesday Thursday
schedule

01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.030 align:start position:0%
schedule
um

01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
as much as possible and then once we've
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
had enough bills we'll then start
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
scheduling subcommittees so uh and urge
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
everyone to keep looking at the list and
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
and in in terms of of telling me what
 
01:49:42.890 --> 01:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
what subcommittee you want to be on so
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
next week will be 10 o'clock
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
I do tend because it's an hour
 
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
difference for me to do in sleep
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
sleeping in the morning and that means I
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
have to get up at 6 30 rather than 7 30.
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
my body's thinks seven is the right time
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
at 6 30.
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
Fifth and 106.
 
01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
Fifth and 106.
um

01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.340 --> 03:20:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
it's

03:20:56.950 --> 03:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.450 --> 03:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing on
 
03:21:02.330 --> 03:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 39 and I'm looking for the
 
03:21:02.340 --> 03:21:04.250 align:start position:0%
House Bill 39 and I'm looking for the
sponsor

03:21:04.250 --> 03:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
anybody here A friend of the sponsor
 
03:21:13.380 --> 03:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
anybody here A friend of the sponsor
okay

03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.769 --> 03:22:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:04.269 --> 03:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay now we'll open up the public
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 39
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
and hear from representative Vale good
 
03:26:13.439 --> 03:26:16.210 align:start position:0%
and hear from representative Vale good
afternoon

03:26:16.210 --> 03:26:16.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:18.110 --> 03:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:26:20.750 --> 03:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
um chairman hunt and good afternoon to
 
03:26:23.510 --> 03:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee I am pleased to
 
03:26:26.929 --> 03:26:26.939 align:start position:0%
be for to be before you this afternoon
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the expedient hearing
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
that you put in on this bill I for the
 
03:26:35.330 --> 03:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
record I'm Suzanne Vale of Nashua ward 3
 
03:26:38.030 --> 03:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm here before you to hopefully
 
03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
persuade you to consider the bill that
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
has been come before you a couple times
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
so here's the question would it be
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
better for New Hampshire consumers if
 
03:26:49.729 --> 03:26:49.739 align:start position:0%
paper billing fees were banned
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
Banning paper Billy billing fees was
 
03:26:54.130 --> 03:26:54.140 align:start position:0%
likely beneficial for many people
 
03:26:57.170 --> 03:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
particularly those who have not
 
03:27:01.190 --> 03:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
had technology in their homes and who
 
03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
are not used to and not comfortable with
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
for example some older adults may prefer
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
paper milling and mind it may find it
 
03:27:15.410 --> 03:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
more difficult to understand and manage
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
their bills online
 
03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
low-income individuals may also like to
 
03:27:22.250 --> 03:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
rely on paper billing because they may
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
not have access to a computer or the
 
03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
internet and they may not be able to
 
03:27:28.250 --> 03:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
avoid afford the additional fees
 
03:27:30.769 --> 03:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
associated with electronic billing
 
03:27:32.570 --> 03:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
additionally people that are worried
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
about the security of personal
 
03:27:36.290 --> 03:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
information or have concerns about
 
03:27:39.290 --> 03:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
online transaction would also appreciate
 
03:27:41.809 --> 03:27:41.819 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
03:27:43.729 --> 03:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
receive and pay their bills through
 
03:27:46.190 --> 03:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
traditional mail Banning paper billing
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
fees could also help to promote
 
03:27:50.809 --> 03:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
Financial inclusion by ensuring that
 
03:27:53.809 --> 03:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
basic financial services are acceptable
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
and accessible to everyone regardless of
 
03:27:59.210 --> 03:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
their income or
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
level of technological literacy so as
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
I'm late and I'm so sorry to be late
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
I've uh
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time that you waited for
 
03:28:13.490 --> 03:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
me but I just wanted to impress upon the
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
committee I know that you have new
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
people and I also know that you have
 
03:28:20.450 --> 03:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
seen this bill before and it has really
 
03:28:24.170 --> 03:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
becoming difficult with companies that
 
03:28:28.010 --> 03:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
are private charging processing fees for
 
03:28:31.849 --> 03:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
paying mint of utilities for example now
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
I went to pay my my heating bill
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago and I gave it my
 
03:28:41.090 --> 03:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
bank information it went to some third
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
party I don't know who they are
 
03:28:46.729 --> 03:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
and at the end of it it said to me that
 
03:28:48.650 --> 03:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
they use a third party service to pay
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:28:54.650 --> 03:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
and I might incur a transaction fee I
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
sat there with my mouse saying do I
 
03:28:59.690 --> 03:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
click or no so when you look at how
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
these things are really excluding people
 
03:29:05.090 --> 03:29:05.100 align:start position:0%
you know we have ai chat Bots out there
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
that will do half of our work and some
 
03:29:11.150 --> 03:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
people have nothing but a pen and paper
 
03:29:14.450 --> 03:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't have to go in every
 
03:29:17.389 --> 03:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
situation I'm hoping you know to set a
 
03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
tone even for the season that people
 
03:29:22.250 --> 03:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
think about how technology is really
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
holding people back and how unfair it is
 
03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
to have people companies that
 
03:29:30.000 --> 03:29:30.530 align:start position:0%
to have people companies that
um

03:29:30.530 --> 03:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
charge you for the lack of technology or
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
the lack of knowledge
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
but also just they're leaving you behind
 
03:29:40.370 --> 03:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
because you're incurring you incurred
 
03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
Financial issues and you might have just
 
03:29:45.650 --> 03:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
enough money to pay that electric bill
 
03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
but then they're charging you to pay it
 
03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
and you just back off we want people to
 
03:29:53.150 --> 03:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
be able to move forward and to really
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
look at these carefully so although I
 
03:29:58.849 --> 03:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
can I don't want to take up a lot of
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
your time I can submit my testimony
 
03:30:02.510 --> 03:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:30:06.469 --> 03:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
um to you um digitally but I just wanted
 
03:30:08.330 --> 03:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
to really look at the situation here
 
03:30:10.729 --> 03:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
because I think that it's not fair or
 
03:30:13.130 --> 03:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
reasonable to expect people to pay
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
additional fees just to pay their bills
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
and basic Financial Services again like
 
03:30:20.450 --> 03:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
bill payment should be accessible to
 
03:30:22.729 --> 03:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
everyone and it shouldn't be such a
 
03:30:25.070 --> 03:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
disparity now and as technology
 
03:30:28.729 --> 03:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
technology races away from all of us I
 
03:30:30.530 --> 03:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
personally I'm going to leave on this
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
note and just I mean leave my
 
03:30:36.650 --> 03:30:36.660 align:start position:0%
finish up on this note and that that
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
note is that I just find it really
 
03:30:42.889 --> 03:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
overpowering to go and do a
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon's worth of and errands if I
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
stop into six places I have to use six
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
different machines with six different
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
people telling me six different ways to
 
03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
use the one machine they have there I go
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
into CVS they want my phone number they
 
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
want this they want that I have a 90
 
03:31:03.469 --> 03:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
year old neighbor who doesn't go to CVS
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
anymore she doesn't want to tell them
 
03:31:07.729 --> 03:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
everything she doesn't want these paper
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't want the trail she doesn't want
 
03:31:12.229 --> 03:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
anything that goes with the news that we
 
03:31:14.450 --> 03:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
see all the time that people have been
 
03:31:16.370 --> 03:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
hacked I've been hacked like five times
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
I don't even know if I'm getting hacked
 
03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we're all getting hacked right now
 
03:31:21.710 --> 03:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
so there's no doubt in my mind with
 
03:31:24.290 --> 03:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
technology today and I'm sorry if I'm
 
03:31:26.030 --> 03:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
speaking over anyone's head I kind of
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
consider myself a closet geek and I do
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.250 --> 03:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
great can you give me an example because
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
I'm one of these people I love
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
receipts my result my credit card
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
companies and everybody always say don't
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't you want to do something for the
 
03:31:47.150 --> 03:31:47.160 align:start position:0%
environment and get you know and I go no
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
I like getting my statements and I don't
 
03:31:51.410 --> 03:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
know I don't have anybody that invoices
 
03:31:55.010 --> 03:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
me so can you tell me who actually is
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
like in New Hampshire business that
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
actually I mean utility what utility
 
03:32:00.969 --> 03:32:00.979 align:start position:0%
because I mean I I get one day a week
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
every month I get six different electric
 
03:32:07.250 --> 03:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
bills all the envelopes and I there's a
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
lot of paper I have to run through but
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.050 --> 03:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
yeah getting used to the microphones
 
03:32:20.990 --> 03:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
again I'm not sure
 
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:22.670 align:start position:0%
again I'm not sure
um

03:32:22.670 --> 03:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:26.330 --> 03:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
so for me it's T-Mobile right now
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
they switched over from Sprint Sprint
 
03:32:31.849 --> 03:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
used to charge you for a paper bill
 
03:32:34.250 --> 03:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
now they'll charge you for a paper Bill
 
03:32:37.010 --> 03:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
if you want to have the whole history of
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
phone calls that you've made that has to
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
come in a paper bill it's very difficult
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
to get that kind of history and that
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
kind of information from the web so
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
people do ask for the additional
 
03:32:49.969 --> 03:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
information and they do ask for that
 
03:32:51.769 --> 03:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
bill to be laid out the way they would
 
03:32:54.469 --> 03:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
see it on paper and older people are
 
03:32:56.090 --> 03:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
looking they're converting what we do
 
03:32:56.100 --> 03:32:58.190 align:start position:0%
looking they're converting what we do
today

03:32:58.190 --> 03:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:33:00.410 --> 03:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
from what we used to do which is paper
 
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
so for this to work for people it has to
 
03:33:05.889 --> 03:33:05.899 align:start position:0%
be better than paper
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
part of my argument and part of my hope
 
03:33:10.610 --> 03:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
that you will look at this again is
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
basically that yes we do have
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns I don't like
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
paper if I can help it I don't use paper
 
03:33:21.229 --> 03:33:21.239 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that it is
 
03:33:23.990 --> 03:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
not searchable I get 300 million things
 
03:33:25.849 --> 03:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
that come into my office and I can't
 
03:33:28.990 --> 03:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
find anything if it's not also digital
 
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
and if it's not searchable it's not very
 
03:33:34.910 --> 03:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
useful to me any longer there are just
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
way too many details I'm responsible for
 
03:33:40.130 --> 03:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
in the course of my job that rely on
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
more and more vendors getting between me
 
03:33:45.410 --> 03:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
and the job I'm trying to do
 
03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
I could go on about this forever but I
 
03:33:50.450 --> 03:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to over serve myself well the
 
03:33:53.450 --> 03:33:53.460 align:start position:0%
reason I ask is because I have Verizon
 
03:33:55.969 --> 03:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
and U.S cellular you know my wife we
 
03:33:57.170 --> 03:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
have several because I don't like being
 
03:33:59.929 --> 03:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
on one and uh neither one of them
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
charges they they send me I get a
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
printed statement and they don't charge
 
03:34:07.429 --> 03:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
me for it so the question I would have
 
03:34:12.170 --> 03:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
is is if there is one that does T-Mobile
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why they're cheaper than
 
03:34:17.090 --> 03:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
everybody else is because they're like
 
03:34:19.370 --> 03:34:19.380 align:start position:0%
Southwest they add charge for extra fee
 
03:34:20.570 --> 03:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
you know you want those extra things
 
03:34:22.250 --> 03:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge you for it so that
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically all you would have to do
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
is change the vendor
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
you know go to go to Verizon or at T and
 
03:34:31.969 --> 03:34:31.979 align:start position:0%
and or somewhere ever and they might not
 
03:34:35.229 --> 03:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
this is right do I get one too I'm sorry
 
03:34:43.610 --> 03:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
yeah would you believe me you don't have
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
to answer the question
 
03:34:48.349 --> 03:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
in other words I'm posing a
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically you might can you can
 
03:34:51.650 --> 03:34:51.660 align:start position:0%
respond or would you believe you can say
 
03:34:55.729 --> 03:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
yes or no or or have an opinion
 
03:34:57.950 --> 03:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
well at it's actually a very good one
 
03:34:59.690 --> 03:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't the person want to just
 
03:35:01.490 --> 03:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
change vendors and use a different
 
03:35:04.490 --> 03:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
service Etc but if you don't have the
 
03:35:06.650 --> 03:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
technology to do that then you cannot
 
03:35:09.769 --> 03:35:09.779 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing is so I'm just
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to give another quick thing
 
03:35:13.490 --> 03:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine is trying to buy an
 
03:35:16.010 --> 03:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
oven it has this it has that it has this
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
it has that is Wi-Fi I'm like oh that's
 
03:35:20.570 --> 03:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
great she wants to know I don't I'm not
 
03:35:22.969 --> 03:35:22.979 align:start position:0%
up on ovens and what's on them but I
 
03:35:25.010 --> 03:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
thought it was very interesting and then
 
03:35:26.450 --> 03:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
a couple days later I was thinking about
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
it and I was like why didn't I say does
 
03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
it work without Wi-Fi why didn't I say
 
03:35:31.969 --> 03:35:31.979 align:start position:0%
that to her I hope she didn't buy it now
 
03:35:34.849 --> 03:35:34.859 align:start position:0%
by now so I mean we're really looking at
 
03:35:37.729 --> 03:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
it we're at this point we're at a huge
 
03:35:39.889 --> 03:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
disadvantage as consumers
 
03:35:42.650 --> 03:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
so I hope again like I said that this
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
this bill came through I think this
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee on 13 to 6 in 2021 it was
 
03:35:53.090 --> 03:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
filed by Sophia wazir twice I believe
 
03:35:56.929 --> 03:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
before this hearing and I do think that
 
03:35:59.210 --> 03:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
with a vote like that that I can
 
03:36:01.370 --> 03:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
hopefully get some people interested in
 
03:36:03.050 --> 03:36:03.060 align:start position:0%
working on it or at least just looking
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
at what we're doing now because we have
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems with our utilities and
 
03:36:09.830 --> 03:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
when we're I mean I was horrified I was
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
like what if why would anyone want to
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
stop me from paying this bill this is
 
03:36:17.570 --> 03:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
what makes the world go around so thank
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
you so much if you if there are other
 
03:36:19.080 --> 03:36:20.389 align:start position:0%
you so much if you if there are other
questions

03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:36:22.370 --> 03:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
we do brother representative Sullivan
 
03:36:24.650 --> 03:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so I have one question I guess I do
 
03:36:29.570 --> 03:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
use Verizon and they give me I think
 
03:36:31.250 --> 03:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's five dollar discount to be on auto
 
03:36:33.650 --> 03:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
pay and knocking bills so how would this
 
03:36:36.410 --> 03:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
bill deal with that situation so if
 
03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
let's say the base price is going to be
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
a hundred dollars and they want to
 
03:36:44.809 --> 03:36:44.819 align:start position:0%
charge 101 or whatever 105 dollars to to
 
03:36:47.809 --> 03:36:47.819 align:start position:0%
send a paper Bill uh couldn't we just do
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
it in reverse where the price is 105 and
 
03:36:51.530 --> 03:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
you get the five dollar discount if you
 
03:36:53.929 --> 03:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
choose I mean would this bill tackle
 
03:36:56.450 --> 03:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
that it's not attacked on it just seems
 
03:36:58.729 --> 03:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
like that to me is the obvious loophole
 
03:37:00.229 --> 03:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
when I read through this is like oh they
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
don't want us to charge for it then
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
we're just going to build it into the
 
03:37:04.910 --> 03:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
price and then offer a discount if you
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
choose to do electronic billing or
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
whatever so I don't know if you thought
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
about that or a few of us if you have an
 
03:37:12.650 --> 03:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
opinion of how this bill should address
 
03:37:14.330 --> 03:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
that or if it should
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
that is a great question and I'm too
 
03:37:18.889 --> 03:37:18.899 align:start position:0%
close I'm still learning this and what I
 
03:37:24.830 --> 03:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:27.769 --> 03:37:27.779 align:start position:0%
um So my answer to that is this is what
 
03:37:29.690 --> 03:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
we need to look at because I didn't even
 
03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
think about that being a reverse
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
Technique we get five bucks off on
 
03:37:35.330 --> 03:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
everything for paying it electronically
 
03:37:39.410 --> 03:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
on time so as far as I think this goes
 
03:37:41.570 --> 03:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
that might go into a little different
 
03:37:46.130 --> 03:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
area than this would be because that's
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
about if you use auto debit or not but
 
03:37:52.490 --> 03:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't be punished for not
 
03:37:55.010 --> 03:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
being able to use an automatic debit
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't real I'd never looked
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
at that as punishing anybody I just
 
03:38:01.490 --> 03:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
looked at that as like okay if we pay
 
03:38:02.929 --> 03:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
every month and we promise to be
 
03:38:06.469 --> 03:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
faithful then we'll get five bucks off
 
03:38:08.929 --> 03:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
so this is this is just where I'm going
 
03:38:11.330 --> 03:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
we just have so much going on here and
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
you have a huge agenda so and with 800
 
03:38:17.210 --> 03:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
bills I'm hoping that this one gets some
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
time in front of the legislature and
 
03:38:22.010 --> 03:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
there's a big floor fight on it when we
 
03:38:23.690 --> 03:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
figure out what's right and what's wrong
 
03:38:27.050 --> 03:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
no no thank you so much representative
 
03:38:28.969 --> 03:38:28.979 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:39.889 --> 03:38:39.899 align:start position:0%
Suzanne was my running mate okay uh
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
we I I the only question I really have
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
is on the
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh individual agreed by violation of
 
03:38:49.190 --> 03:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall bring a private civil
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
action what what was your thoughts on
 
03:38:52.910 --> 03:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
that what were you trying to get out of
 
03:38:54.290 --> 03:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
that I mean what did you think a person
 
03:38:54.300 --> 03:38:55.309 align:start position:0%
that I mean what did you think a person
could

03:38:55.309 --> 03:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
was aiming to get
 
03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:00.899 align:start position:0%
as opposed to you know maybe just if
 
03:39:08.809 --> 03:39:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:08.819 --> 03:39:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:39:12.229 --> 03:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:15.410 --> 03:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
that's a good two bucks time 12 months
 
03:39:16.729 --> 03:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
before they caught up with you on the
 
03:39:16.739 --> 03:39:17.389 align:start position:0%
before they caught up with you on the
bill

03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:39:20.690 --> 03:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
you could assume for 24. how much is
 
03:39:22.849 --> 03:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
that going to cost you 60 bucks to go
 
03:39:31.370 --> 03:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
represent um chairman hunt I just want
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that representative spear
 
03:39:36.769 --> 03:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
was able to complete her question before
 
03:39:39.370 --> 03:39:39.380 align:start position:0%
my disruption
 
03:39:42.950 --> 03:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I I completed it it was just I just
 
03:39:44.389 --> 03:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to know what you what your
 
03:39:46.729 --> 03:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
thoughts were on what that meant you
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:53.870 --> 03:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
now I know when when Sophia wrote the
 
03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
original Bill what this is a refile that
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
the the what we were looking at was just
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
to try to get people for to stop doing
 
03:40:04.130 --> 03:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
it and to reverse it so this really is
 
03:40:06.410 --> 03:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
not based on any knowledge of criminal
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
offense or like a civil
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.769 --> 03:40:23.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
under the private closet of action is
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
the intent to Simply allow for actual
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
damages or is the intent there to also
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
allow for the recoup of the Civil
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
penalties under uh section one above the
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
the 500 offense or the second daughter
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollar second offense and
 
03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
would you please repeat that question
 
03:40:56.090 --> 03:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
so when if we're an individual were to
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
bring a private uh class of action under
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh section uh four two would that simply
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
be to for the actual damages for example
 
03:41:08.690 --> 03:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
the one dollar fee or they also be
 
03:41:12.110 --> 03:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
recouping for example the a 500 fee for
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
the first offense five thousand dollars
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
for the second offense under section
 
03:41:18.370 --> 03:41:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
so I think I can answer this question
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
under the consumer protection act
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have uh the right uh you know uh
 
03:41:31.490 --> 03:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
triple private right of action and it's
 
03:41:34.250 --> 03:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
triple damages so I think they were just
 
03:41:37.070 --> 03:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
trying to lift that concept
 
03:41:39.170 --> 03:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
and because this statute is you know is
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
different and then using that penalty
 
03:41:44.210 --> 03:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
um then having the fines plus the
 
03:41:46.849 --> 03:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
penalty uh seems like a little over
 
03:41:48.950 --> 03:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
overdoing it but that's where the right
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
right of private action is under our
 
03:41:52.729 --> 03:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act thank you I was
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
trying to capture if this was trying to
 
03:41:55.190 --> 03:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
be a paga or if they were simply trying
 
03:41:58.130 --> 03:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
to get the uh the actual damages there
 
03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah right which is we are
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act is supposed to
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
be which is to make you whole thank you
 
03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah
 
03:42:09.889 --> 03:42:09.899 align:start position:0%
look at represent priscelli
 
03:42:12.349 --> 03:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
I see here it says nothing in this
 
03:42:14.150 --> 03:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
section shall apply to a government
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
agency so I don't know do government
 
03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
agencies charge for
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
paper billing and why wouldn't the same
 
03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:31.190 --> 03:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
section two
 
03:42:35.809 --> 03:42:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:37.969 --> 03:42:37.979 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm not working with line
 
03:42:40.130 --> 03:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
items that's part of my problem I'm so
 
03:42:49.090 --> 03:42:49.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
a government agency charging you a fee
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
to do business with them wouldn't be
 
03:42:56.690 --> 03:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
under the same laws as I would think a
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
per a private business so it would at
 
03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
times when the legislation is written it
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
is added in there where it may or may
 
03:43:07.729 --> 03:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
not be necessary but it is to guide you
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
away from thinking that this law is
 
03:43:14.450 --> 03:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
going to change governmental law and I
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
can just only give an example
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
um where I had a bill that went in front
 
03:43:20.580 --> 03:43:21.410 align:start position:0%
um where I had a bill that went in front
of

03:43:21.410 --> 03:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%
um committee to double the time for a
 
03:43:26.870 --> 03:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations if you had an
 
03:43:31.070 --> 03:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
injury by pfas in toxins in your water
 
03:43:34.969 --> 03:43:34.979 align:start position:0%
and that bill was about the statute of
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
limitations so at that time we looked at
 
03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
it we wanted to make sure that
 
03:43:44.570 --> 03:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
everything that we wrote for a town to
 
03:43:46.729 --> 03:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
be able to take civil action against a
 
03:43:50.110 --> 03:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
private company wouldn't prohibit
 
03:43:53.330 --> 03:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
a town to take civil action against a
 
03:43:56.450 --> 03:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
state and nobody wanted to make that
 
03:43:58.849 --> 03:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
kind of mistake so thank you for the
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%

have regarding enforcement which some of
 
03:44:45.010 --> 03:44:45.020 align:start position:0%

third offense respectively
um

03:45:09.769 --> 03:45:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:12.110 --> 03:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it says the Department of Justice
 
03:45:14.630 --> 03:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for enforcement of
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
so although the statute empowers the
 
03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:21.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to enforce it does
 
03:45:24.290 --> 03:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
not Grant the Department of Justice any
 
03:45:24.300 --> 03:45:25.450 align:start position:0%
not Grant the Department of Justice any
powers

03:45:25.450 --> 03:45:25.460 align:start position:0%
powers
 
03:45:29.150 --> 03:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
to enforce it and the fact that the
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
statute does not state that a violation
 
03:45:35.570 --> 03:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
is also is an unfair and deceptive act
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
under 358a which is our consumer
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
03:45:42.530 --> 03:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
means that all our normal investigatory
 
03:45:45.769 --> 03:45:45.779 align:start position:0%
and enforcement tools available subpoena
 
03:45:48.370 --> 03:45:48.380 align:start position:0%
Powers assurances
 
03:45:51.170 --> 03:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
injunctive relief would not be available
 
03:45:54.530 --> 03:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
to enforce this bill
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
um which raises the question of what can
 
03:46:00.170 --> 03:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice do to ensure
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
people comply with this
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
and to that point the statute is silent
 
03:46:09.769 --> 03:46:09.779 align:start position:0%
in addition the way that it's written
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
with specific enumerated powers for
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
private citizens to enforce grieved
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
individual can get injunctive relief
 
03:46:21.290 --> 03:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
actual damages attorney fees and costs
 
03:46:24.170 --> 03:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
but there are no enumerated remedies for
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice leaves room
 
03:46:29.210 --> 03:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
for an argument that the legislature
 
03:46:31.130 --> 03:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
does not intend to provide those
 
03:46:33.650 --> 03:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
remedies to the Department of Justice
 
03:46:36.530 --> 03:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
and for these reasons it's our belief
 
03:46:39.530 --> 03:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
that this bill in its current form may
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
be problematic to enforce
 
03:46:46.570 --> 03:46:46.580 align:start position:0%
so it's our recommendation either that
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature states that a violation
 
03:46:51.050 --> 03:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
of the statute is an unfair and
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
deceptive act on uh or practice within
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
the meaning of 358-a or within the
 
03:47:00.170 --> 03:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
statute itself simply specifically
 
03:47:03.530 --> 03:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
Define tools available and remedies for
 
03:47:06.769 --> 03:47:06.779 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice to enforce it
 
03:47:08.570 --> 03:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
any questions or we should just move it
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
from 359 you just put it under 358a as
 
03:47:18.530 --> 03:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
one of is an unfair trade practice yeah
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of um a lot of statutes uh just
 
03:47:25.250 --> 03:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
have a phrase that says any violation of
 
03:47:27.769 --> 03:47:27.779 align:start position:0%
this statute is an unfair and deceptive
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
act in practice so just puts all those
 
03:47:33.290 --> 03:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
powers and remedies that are under 358a
 
03:47:33.300 --> 03:47:35.450 align:start position:0%
powers and remedies that are under 358a
yes

03:47:35.450 --> 03:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:47:35.460 --> 03:47:36.590 align:start position:0%
yes
yeah

03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:47:39.229 --> 03:47:39.239 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
03:48:00.650 --> 03:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:48:01.969 --> 03:48:01.979 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:48:04.750 --> 03:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
Henry vayu and I'm here on behalf of
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
ctia which is the uh Association of uh
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
Wireless communication uh industry
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
um back I don't know 10 years ago it was
 
03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
the cellular technology industry
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
Association and then they kind of merge
 
03:48:26.690 --> 03:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
with the internet folks and now it's
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
ctia the wireless communication industry
 
03:48:34.969 --> 03:48:34.979 align:start position:0%
so um anyways I
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
handed uh everybody uh a uh some written
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
testimony uh on this bill
 
03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
um and as uh the sponsor indicated this
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
bill has been before this committee uh
 
03:48:51.410 --> 03:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
several times and uh in each instance
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
this in the wisdom of this committee uh
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
they've not uh centered forward uh and
 
03:49:02.510 --> 03:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
we hope the committee does the same with
 
03:49:03.769 --> 03:49:03.779 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:49:03.779 --> 03:49:04.370 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

03:49:04.370 --> 03:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:07.490 --> 03:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
our industry has uh various different
 
03:49:10.130 --> 03:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
practices uh with regards to paper
 
03:49:13.010 --> 03:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
billing there's not one size at all so
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
it does vary but we do oppose uh this
 
03:49:19.849 --> 03:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
bill uh for a couple of reasons
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
uh the first reason is that if you want
 
03:49:27.170 --> 03:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
to avoid uh paying a fee there are
 
03:49:29.469 --> 03:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
options out there
 
03:49:33.610 --> 03:49:33.620 align:start position:0%
if you have a cellular phone
 
03:49:37.190 --> 03:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
you can pay on your cellular phone if
 
03:49:39.650 --> 03:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
you don't know how to do it on your
 
03:49:42.469 --> 03:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
phone you can call the Carrier and find
 
03:49:43.849 --> 03:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
out how to do it and they'll walk you
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
through how to to pay it if you want to
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
avoid a fee if they do charge your fee
 
03:49:51.410 --> 03:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
and as I said it varies across all the
 
03:49:54.410 --> 03:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
different providers it's not one size at
 
03:49:57.110 --> 03:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
all and then the other reason for
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
opposition is the unique uh private
 
03:50:02.830 --> 03:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
right of action that is in this bill
 
03:50:05.929 --> 03:50:05.939 align:start position:0%
which you typically don't see in these
 
03:50:08.809 --> 03:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
kinds of bills which would bring these
 
03:50:10.969 --> 03:50:10.979 align:start position:0%
kinds of things into the courts which
 
03:50:14.450 --> 03:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
were already clogged so for those
 
03:50:20.410 --> 03:50:20.420 align:start position:0%
reasons we oppose house bill 39.
 
03:50:24.830 --> 03:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay any questions or Henry to see none
 
03:50:28.929 --> 03:50:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh I got one more card left
 
03:50:37.550 --> 03:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.729 --> 03:50:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:47.210 --> 03:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
all right welcome oh hi uh Mr chairman
 
03:50:49.490 --> 03:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee members I speak in opposition
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
to this bill uh already some things have
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
already been brought up but I just
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned them anyway uh
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
most businesses are moving to the online
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
thing it's it's the fact of the matter
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
is cheaper it saves them money and they
 
03:51:06.349 --> 03:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
can make their cost to Consumers less so
 
03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
everybody benefits
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
um most consumers are actually happy
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
with this and it's just you know older
 
03:51:16.130 --> 03:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
ones like me that might be prefer the
 
03:51:17.570 --> 03:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
old way
 
03:51:19.969 --> 03:51:19.979 align:start position:0%
um it's basically a user's fee and
 
03:51:23.210 --> 03:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
actually if they pay the same rate as
 
03:51:25.910 --> 03:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else and yet they are causing
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
more costs with the paper billing and
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
you have to have an office there then
 
03:51:32.809 --> 03:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
actually the other people are paying
 
03:51:35.210 --> 03:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
that it's being shared around so that's
 
03:51:37.550 --> 03:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
unfair to the people who do the you know
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
the online stuff which is cheaper
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
um as was already mentioned you can
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
always go to other companies if your
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
company is uh they're doing something
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you're unreasonable there's
 
03:51:51.170 --> 03:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
different cellular companies there's
 
03:51:53.929 --> 03:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
even uh like I have you know Breeze line
 
03:51:57.170 --> 03:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
and you know there's DirecTV and there's
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
other options so if you're not happy
 
03:52:01.190 --> 03:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
with what they're charging
 
03:52:04.250 --> 03:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
you can make a change and that's the
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
basic thing is why is government getting
 
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
involved in this this is not it's
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
between you and the company that you
 
03:52:12.769 --> 03:52:12.779 align:start position:0%
deal with there are other options I'm
 
03:52:14.690 --> 03:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
actually a perfect example on this one
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'm from the old school I like you I
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
like to write out my checks every month
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
I want a paper bill and I put my stamp
 
03:52:26.030 --> 03:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
on it and that's how I like to do it
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
however like a Brie like let's see the
 
03:52:31.610 --> 03:52:31.620 align:start position:0%
Verizon that's not an option you have to
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
have it on your credit card and that's
 
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
that so you know it's the best deal for
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
me right now so I stick with it Breeze
 
03:52:41.150 --> 03:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
line they actually as was mentioned that
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
there's a ten dollars credit
 
03:52:45.410 --> 03:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
as you say they're going to charge you
 
03:52:49.010 --> 03:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
extra but if for a paper billing but if
 
03:52:51.769 --> 03:52:51.779 align:start position:0%
you do the online then it's ten dollars
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
less so you know I do that
 
03:52:57.889 --> 03:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
um I prefer to do it the old way but I'm
 
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:00.660 align:start position:0%
not going to pay 10 bucks extra and
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
frankly if it bothered me that much I
 
03:53:04.929 --> 03:53:04.939 align:start position:0%
could go to a different company so
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
enforcement was talked about so do we
 
03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
really want the courts and the
 
03:53:13.010 --> 03:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice involved with this
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
is such a minor thing where you could go
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
to some other company or you know I mean
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the courts and the
 
03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice should be working
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
on things like murders rapes uh assaults
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
crimes of uh property property crimes
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's what
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement should be getting involved
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
but silly things like this like billing
 
03:53:40.490 --> 03:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
come on it's really silly also what if
 
03:53:43.790 --> 03:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
you are a New Hampshire resident and you
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
might get Services goods or services
 
03:53:48.170 --> 03:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
from a company that's out of state they
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a presence here so if this
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
law passed they'd have to have an office
 
03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
or somewhere where you could take in
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
your payment well
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire small it's a 1.3 million
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
they might figure the heck with it it's
 
03:54:05.450 --> 03:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's not worth for us to do business in
 
03:54:07.010 --> 03:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and New Hampshire
 
03:54:09.769 --> 03:54:09.779 align:start position:0%
residents who happen to like that uh
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
service good or service they will now be
 
03:54:14.690 --> 03:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
deprived of that it's it just wasn't
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
cost effective for the company to do
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
that out of state so this will actually
 
03:54:20.929 --> 03:54:20.939 align:start position:0%
hurt the consumers
 
03:54:23.150 --> 03:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly somebody mentioned
 
03:54:25.729 --> 03:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
about the government thing this is like
 
03:54:27.469 --> 03:54:27.479 align:start position:0%
a double standard
 
03:54:29.929 --> 03:54:29.939 align:start position:0%
if the rule makes sense you would have
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
the same rule for everybody including
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
government agencies too and actually
 
03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
they do if you try to do like a pay your
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
property taxes or something they do
 
03:54:41.450 --> 03:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
normally charge you a fee which kind of
 
03:54:42.590 --> 03:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
03:54:45.889 --> 03:54:45.899 align:start position:0%
uh you're costing them extra and this is
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
the same idea with paper billing or
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
having a physical office if you're
 
03:54:51.889 --> 03:54:51.899 align:start position:0%
costing them extra they're going to make
 
03:54:55.969 --> 03:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
you pay for it it's not unreasonable
 
03:54:55.979 --> 03:54:56.809 align:start position:0%
you pay for it it's not unreasonable
um

03:54:56.809 --> 03:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you
 
03:55:03.050 --> 03:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Burroughs I'll say
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
03:55:06.769 --> 03:55:06.779 align:start position:0%
um I think about people like my mother
 
03:55:09.530 --> 03:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
and mother-in-law who's 95 years old and
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
bedridden and she ain't gonna learn new
 
03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:13.550 align:start position:0%
bedridden and she ain't gonna learn new
technology

03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
technology
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and for a lot of people like her
 
03:55:18.530 --> 03:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
three dollars may not be a lot to you or
 
03:55:20.809 --> 03:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
me but it would be a lot a lot to her
 
03:55:23.330 --> 03:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
and particularly you know you aggregate
 
03:55:25.610 --> 03:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
that with other other companies that do
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
that so I worry about those people and
 
03:55:29.809 --> 03:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
which is why I really liked
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's idea of giving
 
03:55:35.570 --> 03:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
people a discount who do the online
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
thing and that way nobody's penalized
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
and just wondering what you thought
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
about that yeah credits are fine as I
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
say that that's
 
03:55:45.530 --> 03:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
um it's just another way of doing it I
 
03:55:47.030 --> 03:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
mean they're going to bump up your price
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
and then it's like a sales uh you know
 
03:55:52.610 --> 03:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
half half off whatever but they increase
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
the price so I understand but the old
 
03:55:57.469 --> 03:55:57.479 align:start position:0%
people not that spring chicken myself
 
03:56:00.889 --> 03:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
and as I say I prefer the old way but
 
03:56:02.870 --> 03:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know also you know you could have a
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
family member help I know some people
 
03:56:06.229 --> 03:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
they won't do computers or whatever
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's why you have kids and grandkids
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
could help you with that stuff too
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's always a solution I don't think
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
government needs to be involved in
 
03:56:17.929 --> 03:56:17.939 align:start position:0%
making a law on this I I really think
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
that your neighbor can help you if it's
 
03:56:23.330 --> 03:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
that bad that's my feeling
 
03:56:25.370 --> 03:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
and you're like oh yes representative
 
03:56:25.380 --> 03:56:26.570 align:start position:0%
and you're like oh yes representative
post

03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
post
 
03:56:28.429 --> 03:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to get your name I
 
03:56:30.650 --> 03:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
don't know Aubry Friedman uh Bridgewater
 
03:56:33.290 --> 03:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
private citizen and taxpayer and from
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
the old school who likes to do it the
 
03:56:37.849 --> 03:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
old ways but I'm not going to pay even
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
one dollar I one Buck extra but not ten
 
03:56:43.490 --> 03:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
like for raised line so I just think
 
03:56:47.330 --> 03:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
this is silly to have a law on this
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much is there
 
03:56:51.530 --> 03:56:51.540 align:start position:0%

the blue sheet I can't have
 
03:57:03.530 --> 03:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
so do we not have the people sign in
 
03:57:05.870 --> 03:57:05.880 align:start position:0%

House Bill 73
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
and hear from the prime sponsor
 
04:15:37.490 --> 04:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
04:16:02.150 --> 04:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.689 --> 04:16:07.699 align:start position:0%
so I I'm Eric Gallagher I represent
 
04:16:11.210 --> 04:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
conquered Ward 6 which is Merrimack
 
04:16:14.330 --> 04:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
County District 20. um
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I am here to introduce
 
04:16:20.290 --> 04:16:20.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 73
 
04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the repair of Home
 
04:16:24.889 --> 04:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
Appliances which
 
04:16:28.250 --> 04:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
is a right to repair bill
 
04:16:28.260 --> 04:16:31.370 align:start position:0%
is a right to repair bill
so

04:16:31.370 --> 04:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.370 --> 04:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
this bill uh
 
04:16:37.910 --> 04:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
it was here last term
 
04:16:37.920 --> 04:16:38.510 align:start position:0%
it was here last term
um

04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
it was House Bill 449
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the previous term Dave luno was the
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor then but he has decided
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
that he wants to focus more on education
 
04:16:55.849 --> 04:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
this term so I'm picking it up for him
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
basically what right to repair is all
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
about is
 
04:17:02.279 --> 04:17:05.269 align:start position:0%
about is
about

04:17:05.269 --> 04:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:17:05.279 --> 04:17:06.710 align:start position:0%
about
when

04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:17:09.490 --> 04:17:09.500 align:start position:0%
big Com when big
 
04:17:12.650 --> 04:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
manufacturers sell you a product
 
04:17:15.769 --> 04:17:15.779 align:start position:0%
they can't impose restrictions on you
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
that prevent you from getting it
 
04:17:20.929 --> 04:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
repaired where you want to
 
04:17:20.939 --> 04:17:24.410 align:start position:0%
repaired where you want to
so

04:17:24.410 --> 04:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
which is something that you actually
 
04:17:31.370 --> 04:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
see happen sometimes so
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is something that has been kind of
 
04:17:36.790 --> 04:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
gaining momentum recently
 
04:17:39.130 --> 04:17:39.140 align:start position:0%
you you'll see
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
the U.S Farm Bureau recently came to an
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
agreement with John Deere to allow
 
04:17:53.410 --> 04:17:53.420 align:start position:0%
Farmers to repair their tractors
 
04:17:57.170 --> 04:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
and in New York
 
04:17:59.150 --> 04:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
they recently signed a right to repair
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
Bill to law and then you also had it on
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
a ballot measure
 
04:18:05.819 --> 04:18:06.469 align:start position:0%
a ballot measure
um

04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts recently too so this is
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit different from some of
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
those other right to repair attempts
 
04:18:16.130 --> 04:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
though um
 
04:18:17.929 --> 04:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
other ones
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
are well yeah with the tractors one like
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
farm equipment and then also a lot of
 
04:18:25.370 --> 04:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
tech stuff
 
04:18:26.929 --> 04:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
um so like
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
um computers and
 
04:18:30.889 --> 04:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
phones and whatever
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but this uh with this bill
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
when it's focused on other things like
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
that like
 
04:18:40.080 --> 04:18:41.090 align:start position:0%
that like
um

04:18:41.090 --> 04:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:44.570 --> 04:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
the farm equipment or the high-tech
 
04:18:48.530 --> 04:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
stuff is tended to Garner
 
04:18:54.309 --> 04:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
a bit more resistance that way so we
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
have decided
 
04:18:56.819 --> 04:18:58.309 align:start position:0%
have decided
to

04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:02.210 --> 04:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
try to scale it back a little bit
 
04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you know in the name of compromise
 
04:19:06.849 --> 04:19:06.859 align:start position:0%
and just keep this too
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
appliances instead
 
04:19:10.439 --> 04:19:11.570 align:start position:0%
appliances instead
um

04:19:11.570 --> 04:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:15.050 --> 04:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's that's why in the title
 
04:19:16.250 --> 04:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
just home appliances
 
04:19:18.600 --> 04:19:20.090 align:start position:0%
just home appliances
um

04:19:20.090 --> 04:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:20.100 --> 04:19:23.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.040 --> 04:19:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:24.359 --> 04:19:27.290 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
so this is something
 
04:19:32.570 --> 04:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
that will
 
04:19:36.530 --> 04:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
help small businesses that are repair
 
04:19:40.130 --> 04:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
providers like if you looked and saw
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
um with the Massachusetts ballot
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
initiative a lot of the
 
04:19:48.530 --> 04:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
advertisements that were in favor of the
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
measure were from small repair shops
 
04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
that want to have
 
04:19:55.969 --> 04:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
fair treatment
 
04:19:58.610 --> 04:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
when it comes to being able to
 
04:20:02.929 --> 04:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
repair things rather than having the
 
04:20:07.490 --> 04:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
bigger corporations exercise there
 
04:20:11.090 --> 04:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
Monopoly power to
 
04:20:14.210 --> 04:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
be anti-competitive
 
04:20:14.220 --> 04:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
be anti-competitive
um

04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:16.080 --> 04:20:17.570 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:20:17.570 --> 04:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:19.490 --> 04:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's good for it's good for small
 
04:20:21.849 --> 04:20:21.859 align:start position:0%
businesses it's also
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
good for inflation too since if you
 
04:20:29.689 --> 04:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
repair something then you don't have to
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
spend money on buying a new one and then
 
04:20:35.630 --> 04:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
that can help bring
 
04:20:38.090 --> 04:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
prices down
 
04:20:38.100 --> 04:20:38.689 align:start position:0%
prices down
um

04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:42.110 --> 04:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
which is something
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
which is something that people are
 
04:20:48.650 --> 04:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
needing um I I generally try to make my
 
04:20:52.849 --> 04:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
things last as long as they can
 
04:20:52.859 --> 04:20:53.570 align:start position:0%
things last as long as they can
um

04:20:53.570 --> 04:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
you know there's that saying
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
use it up wear it out
 
04:21:01.969 --> 04:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
uh make it do or do without uh I think
 
04:21:03.769 --> 04:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the
 
04:21:03.779 --> 04:21:07.250 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the
spirit

04:21:07.250 --> 04:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
behind this here
 
04:21:10.319 --> 04:21:11.630 align:start position:0%
behind this here
so

04:21:11.630 --> 04:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:15.050 --> 04:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's a way of
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
letting people
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
do with their appliances as
 
04:21:24.769 --> 04:21:24.779 align:start position:0%
they want to and
 
04:21:24.779 --> 04:21:26.929 align:start position:0%
they want to and
um

04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
so so they can keep money in their own
 
04:21:31.490 --> 04:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
pop pockets and don't get
 
04:21:33.769 --> 04:21:33.779 align:start position:0%
if you think about
 
04:21:33.779 --> 04:21:35.769 align:start position:0%
if you think about
what

04:21:35.769 --> 04:21:35.779 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers do with planned
 
04:21:40.910 --> 04:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
obsolescence when they make things to
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
break on purpose so that way people have
 
04:21:48.050 --> 04:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
to buy a new one every so often that's
 
04:21:52.490 --> 04:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
basically uh for uh tax being collected
 
04:21:54.830 --> 04:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
by corporations
 
04:21:58.250 --> 04:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
from consumers so this is a consumer
 
04:22:00.250 --> 04:22:00.260 align:start position:0%
protection bill
 
04:22:00.260 --> 04:22:01.849 align:start position:0%
protection bill
and

04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:04.969 --> 04:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
uh it's something that
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
as someone who tends to break things I I
 
04:22:07.680 --> 04:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
as someone who tends to break things I I
would

04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:22:10.729 --> 04:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
um I have a
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
book here called the right to repair if
 
04:22:18.889 --> 04:22:18.899 align:start position:0%
any of you would like to borrow it to
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
learn more on the
 
04:22:23.389 --> 04:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
subject uh I can
 
04:22:25.969 --> 04:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
lend it out uh
 
04:22:28.370 --> 04:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
this is something that's
 
04:22:30.610 --> 04:22:30.620 align:start position:0%
it's supported by
 
04:22:35.650 --> 04:22:35.660 align:start position:0%
a a wide range of groups such as iFixit
 
04:22:39.170 --> 04:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
the U.S public interest group the center
 
04:22:42.530 --> 04:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
for uh Democratic technology
 
04:22:42.540 --> 04:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
for uh Democratic technology
um it's

04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
04:22:47.330 --> 04:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
a good uh pro-consumer bill and I hope
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
as the
 
04:22:51.290 --> 04:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
committee with
 
04:22:54.110 --> 04:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs in your name that you
 
04:22:57.410 --> 04:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
will give it a fair consideration
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's what I have to say
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
about the bill so far and I'll take any
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:10.490 --> 04:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members okay
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
Representatives inspired
 
04:23:13.020 --> 04:23:18.769 align:start position:0%
Representatives inspired
spear

04:23:18.769 --> 04:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh the the I'm not going to try to get
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
into any details uh we'll have to talk
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
about that later but what I wanted to
 
04:23:27.050 --> 04:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
know is what were your thoughts on how
 
04:23:30.650 --> 04:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
this was going to be enforced since so
 
04:23:32.330 --> 04:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
many of the manufacturers are out of
 
04:23:32.340 --> 04:23:33.410 align:start position:0%
many of the manufacturers are out of
state

04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:23:35.990 --> 04:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
how did you see New Hampshire
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
even enforcing something like this
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
well so if you look at on page three
 
04:23:43.080 --> 04:23:43.910 align:start position:0%
well so if you look at on page three
um

04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:43.920 --> 04:23:46.070 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:46.080 --> 04:23:47.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
on line 31 so 358 T4 remedies so it has
 
04:23:57.650 --> 04:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement by the Attorney General so
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
it basically this would
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
this would depend on having an attorney
 
04:24:07.370 --> 04:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
general in office who is
 
04:24:11.210 --> 04:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
going to bring suit against the
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
companies which is something you do see
 
04:24:14.929 --> 04:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
sometimes but the come
 
04:24:17.210 --> 04:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
state attorney generals will sue out of
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
state companies at times so that is the
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
sort of enforcement mechanism that it
 
04:24:29.809 --> 04:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:32.269 --> 04:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you for
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:24:35.570 --> 04:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
um so I'm confused I'm looking at the
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
fit there's nothing on the fiscal note
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
about costs associated with us and and
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
clearly if the Attorney General is
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcing this it's
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to be time related to his staff
 
04:24:52.130 --> 04:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
etc etc to do this
 
04:24:53.870 --> 04:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering if you could could
 
04:24:55.490 --> 04:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
you know what what is your thoughts
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
about what the financial costs could be
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
to implement this well I mean yeah it
 
04:25:04.490 --> 04:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
says it's indeterminate it depends on
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
um whether
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
it depends on
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether the attorney general actually
 
04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
sues anyone over it or not if all of the
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know you're seeing some companies
 
04:25:22.370 --> 04:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
that are actually starting to get into
 
04:25:24.849 --> 04:25:24.859 align:start position:0%
the business of providing more repair
 
04:25:28.250 --> 04:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
materials to people anyways like just
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
for compliance with other places that
 
04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
have right to repair in place so
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
if there are if they're already in
 
04:25:37.450 --> 04:25:37.460 align:start position:0%
compliance by the time this comes into
 
04:25:40.610 --> 04:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
effect then there nobody will need to be
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.920 --> 04:25:49.610 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:25:49.610 --> 04:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
um representative Gallagher I I read
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
paragraph one and then I read paragraph
 
04:26:00.530 --> 04:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
seven and paragraph one indicates to me
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
that these
 
04:26:06.110 --> 04:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
authorized repair uh provider has had
 
04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
some training or gone through some
 
04:26:07.800 --> 04:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
some training or gone through some
training

04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturer and again if you
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
look at has this happened with John
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
Deere and I know there's been a over the
 
04:26:18.290 --> 04:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
years a lot of talk about automobile
 
04:26:21.710 --> 04:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
repairs I mean in order to to get this
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
information does the manufacturer have
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
to have uh require some sort of training
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
for these these folks or can I just put
 
04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
up a sign and say you know I manual I
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
repair uh dishwashers and and whatever
 
04:26:42.290 --> 04:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
with really no training
 
04:26:45.710 --> 04:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
well yeah it's it mentions having an
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
arrangement with them like yeah if you
 
04:26:48.960 --> 04:26:49.610 align:start position:0%
arrangement with them like yeah if you
um

04:26:49.610 --> 04:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:52.010 --> 04:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
you are oftentimes companies will
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
provide these sorts of trainings like I
 
04:26:54.000 --> 04:26:55.429 align:start position:0%
provide these sorts of trainings like I
remember

04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
um looking into
 
04:27:00.610 --> 04:27:00.620 align:start position:0%
trying to get my Apple repair
 
04:27:03.769 --> 04:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
certification a few years ago but didn't
 
04:27:06.170 --> 04:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
actually go into it um but yeah if you
 
04:27:08.570 --> 04:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
go into repair shops you can usually
 
04:27:10.849 --> 04:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
look up on their walls and they'll see
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
they'll have like their certificates
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
up on the walls of whatever chaining the
 
04:27:17.170 --> 04:27:17.180 align:start position:0%
safe done
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
so that is generally
 
04:27:22.969 --> 04:27:22.979 align:start position:0%
um how so excuse me just to follow up
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
for the question being Claire so you are
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
saying though that this uh
 
04:27:31.610 --> 04:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
authorized independent repair person has
 
04:27:33.710 --> 04:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
had some training
 
04:27:36.110 --> 04:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
under this law and and has been
 
04:27:38.929 --> 04:27:38.939 align:start position:0%
essentially licensed or approved by the
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to use their uh product
 
04:27:42.840 --> 04:27:43.729 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to use their uh product
information

04:27:43.729 --> 04:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:27:46.670 --> 04:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
etc etc is that because it looks almost
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
like one in five one in seven contradict
 
04:27:52.490 --> 04:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:52.500 --> 04:28:05.889 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:28:05.889 --> 04:28:05.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.929 --> 04:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
is a definition of an independent prayer
 
04:28:08.939 --> 04:28:13.070 align:start position:0%
is a definition of an independent prayer
provider

04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.330 --> 04:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.410 --> 04:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
it just excuse me what I should have
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
maybe said is that seven is inclusive of
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.159 --> 04:28:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:28:49.429 --> 04:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:52.370 --> 04:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
yeah this is one of those things where
 
04:28:52.380 --> 04:28:54.050 align:start position:0%
yeah this is one of those things where
um

04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:56.090 --> 04:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
you know if I if I were looking at this
 
04:28:58.910 --> 04:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
on the computer like you could get it to
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
generate a difference between the two
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
but just as a
 
04:29:06.889 --> 04:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
literally human here um and I'm not a
 
04:29:08.929 --> 04:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
liar um
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I
 
04:29:11.760 --> 04:29:12.349 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I
um

04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
I would leave that up to the lawyers to
 
04:29:15.000 --> 04:29:18.349 align:start position:0%
I would leave that up to the lawyers to
interpret

04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
04:29:20.399 --> 04:29:21.889 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

04:29:21.889 --> 04:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:29:23.929 --> 04:29:23.939 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things occurred to me uh
 
04:29:25.370 --> 04:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
reading the bill and some of the
 
04:29:27.110 --> 04:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
supplementary materials that were
 
04:29:29.929 --> 04:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
submitted to us yesterday
 
04:29:29.939 --> 04:29:30.769 align:start position:0%
submitted to us yesterday
um

04:29:30.769 --> 04:29:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:33.849 --> 04:29:33.859 align:start position:0%
it seems that there are some genuine
 
04:29:37.070 --> 04:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
valid concerns regarding safety and
 
04:29:39.950 --> 04:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
cyber security regarding
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
um uh repairs uh done by uh repair
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
people who are not affiliated or have
 
04:29:49.849 --> 04:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
not contracted with or been trained by
 
04:29:53.210 --> 04:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers at the same time it
 
04:29:55.250 --> 04:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
also occurs to me that it would be
 
04:30:00.649 --> 04:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
possible to set up a statutory scheme uh
 
04:30:02.090 --> 04:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
um uh encourage or push Appliance
 
04:30:09.410 --> 04:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in the direction of
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
Designing appliances that could be
 
04:30:12.239 --> 04:30:13.849 align:start position:0%
Designing appliances that could be
safely

04:30:13.849 --> 04:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
safely
 
04:30:13.859 --> 04:30:14.510 align:start position:0%
safely
um

04:30:14.510 --> 04:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:18.530 --> 04:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh repaired by repair people who were
 
04:30:20.330 --> 04:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
not controlled by the original
 
04:30:20.340 --> 04:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
not controlled by the original
manufacturers

04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I understand there's a large
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
incentive in addition to the Safety and
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
Security concerns there's a large
 
04:30:31.130 --> 04:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
incentive uh for the appliance
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to want to control uh the
 
04:30:36.290 --> 04:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
repair people
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
um and that it would be possible as I as
 
04:30:41.870 --> 04:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
I said to have a statutory scheme that
 
04:30:44.450 --> 04:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
would encourage the manufacturers to
 
04:30:47.929 --> 04:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
design their appliances so they could be
 
04:30:52.010 --> 04:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
safely repaired uh by repair people who
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
are who are not who have not contracted
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
the original manufacturer but
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you
 
04:31:00.479 --> 04:31:01.370 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you
um

04:31:01.370 --> 04:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
would you agree that to be effective
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
this would the statutory scheme would
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
have to be Nationwide and that trying to
 
04:31:12.170 --> 04:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
do it
 
04:31:12.180 --> 04:31:12.889 align:start position:0%
do it
um

04:31:12.889 --> 04:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire would be extremely
 
04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
difficult well
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
um yes I
 
04:31:25.130 --> 04:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
my preferred solution would be to have a
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
national right to repair law which is
 
04:31:30.469 --> 04:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
something that the buying Administration
 
04:31:33.290 --> 04:31:33.300 align:start position:0%
has been pushing for through executive
 
04:31:35.929 --> 04:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
branch rule making but the thing about
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch rulemaking is that it's
 
04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
brittle and
 
04:31:43.670 --> 04:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
as soon as the
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
next president comes into power they
 
04:31:49.929 --> 04:31:49.939 align:start position:0%
could immediately undo those so I think
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
having state level protections as well
 
04:31:54.239 --> 04:31:55.550 align:start position:0%
having state level protections as well
would

04:31:55.550 --> 04:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:31:55.560 --> 04:31:56.809 align:start position:0%
would
be

04:31:56.809 --> 04:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:31:59.929 --> 04:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
a good sort of
 
04:32:03.050 --> 04:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
bulwark or redundancy for
 
04:32:03.060 --> 04:32:04.210 align:start position:0%
bulwark or redundancy for
um

04:32:04.210 --> 04:32:04.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
back up for in case
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government changes things
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
and you have also seen uh other states
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
implementing these so
 
04:32:16.729 --> 04:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
I I don't think
 
04:32:21.769 --> 04:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
it's beyond our power as a state to do
 
04:32:23.330 --> 04:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing when we've seen other
 
04:32:24.710 --> 04:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
states doing it
 
04:32:27.830 --> 04:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up comment
 
04:32:27.840 --> 04:32:29.269 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up comment
s

04:32:29.269 --> 04:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
s
 
04:32:32.510 --> 04:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
could it be that it's not just a
 
04:32:37.610 --> 04:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
question of the right to repair but
 
04:32:37.620 --> 04:32:39.050 align:start position:0%
question of the right to repair but
rather

04:32:39.050 --> 04:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
rather
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
a system
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
that would encourage manufacturers to
 
04:32:44.520 --> 04:32:45.610 align:start position:0%
that would encourage manufacturers to
design

04:32:45.610 --> 04:32:45.620 align:start position:0%
design
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
appliances and equipment that could be
 
04:32:51.530 --> 04:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
safely repaired because I think it is
 
04:32:54.530 --> 04:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
true that right now there are a lot of
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
appliances that it would be a problem it
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
might be unsafe if they were repaired by
 
04:33:04.609 --> 04:33:04.619 align:start position:0%
repair people who had not been trained
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
by the original manufacturer but that it
 
04:33:09.369 --> 04:33:09.379 align:start position:0%
would be possible
 
04:33:13.849 --> 04:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
if the manufacturers knew that this was
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to be happening on a broad scale
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
that they would be encouraged to design
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
appliances that could be safely
 
04:33:29.390 --> 04:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
repaired by independent repair people
 
04:33:29.400 --> 04:33:30.650 align:start position:0%
repaired by independent repair people
um

04:33:30.650 --> 04:33:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:32.810 --> 04:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
I mean yes that's
 
04:33:32.820 --> 04:33:34.131 align:start position:0%
I mean yes that's
um

04:33:34.131 --> 04:33:34.141 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:38.090 --> 04:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
so all right if to kind of paraphrase or
 
04:33:40.490 --> 04:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
see if I've got what you're saying so
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying more of uh
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
carrot than a stick type scheme of
 
04:33:49.551 --> 04:33:49.561 align:start position:0%
encouraging of
 
04:33:51.289 --> 04:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
um that that that is something that I
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
have had other
 
04:33:55.869 --> 04:33:55.879 align:start position:0%
um interested parties contact me about
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
for uh this bill
 
04:33:58.799 --> 04:33:59.390 align:start position:0%
for uh this bill
um

04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
and yes I would be open to an an
 
04:34:05.631 --> 04:34:05.641 align:start position:0%
amendment that
 
04:34:05.641 --> 04:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
amendment that
is

04:34:06.590 --> 04:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:34:09.051 --> 04:34:09.061 align:start position:0%
um sorry uh
 
04:34:11.570 --> 04:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
one further follow-up okay thank you I
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:15.719 --> 04:34:16.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:16.490 --> 04:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:19.609 --> 04:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
not so much carrot versus stick rather
 
04:34:19.619 --> 04:34:20.929 align:start position:0%
not so much carrot versus stick rather
than

04:34:20.929 --> 04:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:34:20.939 --> 04:34:22.250 align:start position:0%
than
um

04:34:22.250 --> 04:34:22.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
design changes uh which would
 
04:34:28.970 --> 04:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
they could be encouraged by a carrot or
 
04:34:32.090 --> 04:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
a stick my point was that it might take
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
some genuine design changes in order for
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:38.400 --> 04:34:39.769 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:39.769 --> 04:34:39.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:42.289 --> 04:34:42.299 align:start position:0%
yes I would support
 
04:34:44.810 --> 04:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
I I think that this legislation would
 
04:34:48.410 --> 04:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
encourage those design changes and
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
um which is something you have actually
 
04:34:50.459 --> 04:34:51.769 align:start position:0%
um which is something you have actually
seen

04:34:51.769 --> 04:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
some companies do is start making design
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
changes in response to people asking for
 
04:34:57.480 --> 04:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
changes in response to people asking for
repairability

04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
repairability
 
04:34:59.760 --> 04:35:00.470 align:start position:0%
repairability
um

04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:02.631 --> 04:35:02.641 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:35:08.631 --> 04:35:08.641 align:start position:0%
yes if you have an idea for an amendment
 
04:35:11.090 --> 04:35:11.100 align:start position:0%
on how to do it more that way I would be
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
open to it but um
 
04:35:16.970 --> 04:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
I do not have any such Amendment myself
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.090 --> 04:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
what population
 
04:35:33.289 --> 04:35:33.299 align:start position:0%
is looking for this action is there do
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
you think there's a thousand people in
 
04:35:36.769 --> 04:35:36.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or ten thousand people in
 
04:35:39.051 --> 04:35:39.061 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that feel that they don't
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
have adequate information to fix their
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
own dishwasher I'm just curious where
 
04:35:46.010 --> 04:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
are you getting that where are you
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
getting I I've where's the human cry for
 
04:35:51.131 --> 04:35:51.141 align:start position:0%
this demand for this insulation
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
legislation coming from
 
04:35:57.769 --> 04:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
um the internet uh I I haven't seen much
 
04:36:00.170 --> 04:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
um I haven't seen much polling about it
 
04:36:03.051 --> 04:36:03.061 align:start position:0%
if there are any
 
04:36:03.061 --> 04:36:04.789 align:start position:0%
if there are any
um pulling

04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
um pulling
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
providers out there such as Saint
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
anselms or the UNH survey that are
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
watching this that would like to
 
04:36:14.090 --> 04:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
conduct a poll on this I would welcome
 
04:36:16.849 --> 04:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
that but um as for my own personal
 
04:36:16.859 --> 04:36:18.109 align:start position:0%
that but um as for my own personal
experience

04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
um it's just
 
04:36:22.070 --> 04:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's mostly from the tech geek
 
04:36:24.890 --> 04:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
community of um
 
04:36:28.490 --> 04:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
yeah people who like to be in
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
control of
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire so to be
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
clear there actually isn't any
 
04:36:40.799 --> 04:36:42.170 align:start position:0%
clear there actually isn't any
substantial

04:36:42.170 --> 04:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
demand from
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
consumers to do this this is a
 
04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
population of zero I I think the tech
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
geek Community is a lot bigger than zero
 
04:36:54.299 --> 04:36:56.590 align:start position:0%
geek Community is a lot bigger than zero
okay

04:36:56.590 --> 04:36:56.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:00.529 --> 04:37:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:02.810 --> 04:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge to date how many
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have enacted or are
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
considering rights repair laws in the
 
04:37:09.890 --> 04:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
United States or the EU
 
04:37:12.230 --> 04:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't I am
 
04:37:16.250 --> 04:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
I don't have a specific number for that
 
04:37:19.070 --> 04:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
available on hand but yes
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:21.959 --> 04:37:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
just the ones I've mentioned so far and
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
then you also mentioned the EU the EU is
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
also another one that is considering
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
this as well I've I heard of some
 
04:37:35.449 --> 04:37:35.459 align:start position:0%
western states that are considering as
 
04:37:38.689 --> 04:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
well with the farm machinery
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and John Deere I can't quite remember
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
which one specifically
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but I know it was
 
04:37:47.689 --> 04:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
some of the western states yeah so
 
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts did have a referendum and
 
04:37:52.970 --> 04:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
it was Otto Just Auto and then the the
 
04:37:54.849 --> 04:37:54.859 align:start position:0%
most famous case is the John Deere case
 
04:37:57.830 --> 04:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and which
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
um you're dealing with a quarter of a
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know hey Baylor machine and the
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue was that you had to have a John
 
04:38:12.051 --> 04:38:12.061 align:start position:0%
Deere repair person only was allowed to
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
muck around in it and the farmers were
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
feeling like we penned we pay you all
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
this money to buy this thing you know we
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
can we just go in and fix that and just
 
04:38:23.631 --> 04:38:23.641 align:start position:0%
sell us apart
 
04:38:23.641 --> 04:38:30.490 align:start position:0%
sell us apart
foreign

04:38:30.490 --> 04:38:30.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the EU that are
 
04:38:33.949 --> 04:38:33.959 align:start position:0%
currently considering or have enacted
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation okay that that sounds
 
04:38:39.949 --> 04:38:39.959 align:start position:0%
that sounds correct to me
 
04:38:43.789 --> 04:38:43.799 align:start position:0%
um it's within the range that
 
04:38:43.799 --> 04:38:44.990 align:start position:0%
um it's within the range that
um

04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
I would estimate yes
 
04:38:50.689 --> 04:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
but it there is a difference between how
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
many are considering it and how many
 
04:38:54.650 --> 04:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
have actually passed it
 
04:38:57.410 --> 04:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay I had been acted yeah it would be
 
04:38:58.730 --> 04:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
interesting to see what actually has
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
been enacted I would I would love to see
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
the the EU or did anybody actually other
 
04:39:05.750 --> 04:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
than Massachusetts in the John Deere
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
settlement do you know anybody's
 
04:39:09.890 --> 04:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
actually Mr Mr chairman uh the EU uh
 
04:39:12.051 --> 04:39:12.061 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2020 you but I don't know the
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
results of uh what the weather's
 
04:39:16.849 --> 04:39:16.859 align:start position:0%
actually gone into enactment yet right
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
because usually there's a lot of rule
 
04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
making around well in New York New York
 
04:39:23.209 --> 04:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
as well um Governor hokel just signed
 
04:39:23.219 --> 04:39:24.230 align:start position:0%
as well um Governor hokel just signed
that

04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:27.949 --> 04:39:27.959 align:start position:0%
um like on New Year's Eve I think it was
 
04:39:29.810 --> 04:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
that that's another
 
04:39:34.189 --> 04:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
case study to look at would be New
 
04:39:34.199 --> 04:39:35.810 align:start position:0%
case study to look at would be New
York's

04:39:35.810 --> 04:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
York's
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
fair enough great any more questions oh
 
04:39:39.120 --> 04:39:41.868 align:start position:0%
fair enough great any more questions oh
representative

04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:39:43.610 --> 04:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
we representative ammon's going to be
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
first because he hasn't asked a question
 
04:39:50.570 --> 04:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.490 --> 04:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
um there's a YouTube uh personality I
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
think it's Lewis Rossman
 
04:39:58.730 --> 04:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're familiar with
 
04:40:00.590 --> 04:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
that but he's big on the road to repair
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm somewhat sympathetic to this
 
04:40:06.890 --> 04:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
idea that it's harder and harder to fix
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
things that you pay for and own and you
 
04:40:11.448 --> 04:40:11.458 align:start position:0%
don't really own them but what I do have
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe what I do have an
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
issue with is the Mandate and my
 
04:40:17.208 --> 04:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
question is
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
since we're such a small market and if
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
we're seen as being too heavy-handed on
 
04:40:22.500 --> 04:40:23.750 align:start position:0%
we're seen as being too heavy-handed on
companies

04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:40:26.030 --> 04:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that might discourage them
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
from doing business in our state because
 
04:40:31.010 --> 04:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
because of the size of our Market being
 
04:40:32.208 --> 04:40:32.218 align:start position:0%
so small
 
04:40:34.490 --> 04:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
and that's my question
 
04:40:34.500 --> 04:40:37.850 align:start position:0%
and that's my question
um

04:40:37.850 --> 04:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
as far as whether this is heavy-handed
 
04:40:44.208 --> 04:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
or not I think this is rather milder
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the other places
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
that are also considering right to
 
04:40:48.958 --> 04:40:49.788 align:start position:0%
that are also considering right to
repair

04:40:49.788 --> 04:40:49.798 align:start position:0%
repair
 
04:40:49.798 --> 04:40:50.868 align:start position:0%
repair
um if

04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
um if
 
04:40:53.470 --> 04:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
generally the companies that would be
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
04:40:56.160 --> 04:40:58.070 align:start position:0%
affected by this
have

04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:40:58.080 --> 04:40:59.690 align:start position:0%
have
the

04:40:59.690 --> 04:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:41:03.650 --> 04:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
have the money to be able to
 
04:41:06.770 --> 04:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
comply with it so
 
04:41:08.208 --> 04:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
04:41:11.570 --> 04:41:11.580 align:start position:0%
I would not be too worried about them
 
04:41:14.208 --> 04:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
pulling out of New Hampshire
 
04:41:17.330 --> 04:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
um you know the being small Works kind
 
04:41:20.448 --> 04:41:20.458 align:start position:0%
of both ways uh like
 
04:41:20.458 --> 04:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
of both ways uh like
um

04:41:21.590 --> 04:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
you know it it would only be a small
 
04:41:32.750 --> 04:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
portion on
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
of their total um
 
04:41:37.368 --> 04:41:37.378 align:start position:0%
but it would be something they could
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.150 --> 04:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
I was just going to answer your comment
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
on only to let you know that I saw uh
 
04:41:58.970 --> 04:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
indications that the EU has passed the
 
04:42:00.770 --> 04:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
legislation and it will go in effect
 
04:42:02.750 --> 04:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
this year uh this year
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
and that the UK has passed it and that
 
04:42:09.530 --> 04:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
Ireland has passed it so and but their
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
reasoning is a lot to do not just with
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
repair but because of the fact that
 
04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
Electronics is something like 200
 
04:42:19.850 --> 04:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
million tons
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
in the waste every uh in they quoted a
 
04:42:26.510 --> 04:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
year of 2017. uh God knows it's probably
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
worse than that now and they're trying
 
04:42:31.490 --> 04:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
to use this kind of a bill in their life
 
04:42:34.490 --> 04:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
to kind of reduce the amount of waste
 
04:42:36.650 --> 04:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's in the environment beside the
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
fact that people really do want to
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
repair their stuff and we know from the
 
04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
car industry that they that they do
 
04:42:43.970 --> 04:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
people do it all the time
 
04:42:46.250 --> 04:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to just clarify that
 
04:42:49.368 --> 04:42:49.378 align:start position:0%
part so and yeah to follow up on that if
 
04:42:53.810 --> 04:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
I may um yeah about the waste issue I
 
04:42:55.970 --> 04:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
think that's another good point to
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
mention because that was something that
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
was taught a lot of
 
04:43:03.530 --> 04:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
um controversy about in the house last
 
04:43:05.570 --> 04:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
term with
 
04:43:09.770 --> 04:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
um the safe Forest Lake bill was one
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of activism around
 
04:43:16.250 --> 04:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and it was a pretty
 
04:43:17.930 --> 04:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
um electrifying moment here in the house
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
when we all stood together to pass
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the save Forest Lake Landfill
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
sighting bill so
 
04:43:30.288 --> 04:43:30.298 align:start position:0%
um I think that shows that
 
04:43:32.448 --> 04:43:32.458 align:start position:0%
um you know there's demand for Less
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
waste and that this is one thing we
 
04:43:39.948 --> 04:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
could tell constituents
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
who are interested in reducing our waste
 
04:43:47.390 --> 04:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
output that we are doing to reduce our
 
04:43:50.448 --> 04:43:50.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:50.458 --> 04:43:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.150 --> 04:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh let's see thank you okay
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:44:02.208 --> 04:44:02.218 align:start position:0%
um that's a step down
 
04:44:06.050 --> 04:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
you're all set thank you
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:21.410 --> 04:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
I'm back uh I oppose this one too uh not
 
04:44:23.448 --> 04:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
as many reasons I just have three three
 
04:44:26.330 --> 04:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this but after listening to
 
04:44:27.530 --> 04:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
some of the questions and answers
 
04:44:29.948 --> 04:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
actually one or two more things to add
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
basically this kind of a mandate will
 
04:44:35.810 --> 04:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of these home
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
appliances and that to me is a problem
 
04:44:41.930 --> 04:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
um everything is is getting more
 
04:44:44.810 --> 04:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
expensive these days and obviously these
 
04:44:46.850 --> 04:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
are not great Economic Times and why
 
04:44:49.788 --> 04:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
make products more expensive this will
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
make it more expensive now it is true uh
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
some people would want to fix their
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
items and if they can safely without
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
getting killed or breaking the items
 
04:45:04.310 --> 04:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
worse that they might I'm actually
 
04:45:06.830 --> 04:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
thinking this environmental angle and
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
I've heard it mentioned before is you
 
04:45:12.170 --> 04:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
your products last longer so there's
 
04:45:14.330 --> 04:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
less thing you know to there's it makes
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
sense but if you actually try to repair
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
it yourself and you ruin it then you
 
04:45:24.530 --> 04:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
might actually backfire so you know the
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
idea is good on that but I think for me
 
04:45:29.208 --> 04:45:29.218 align:start position:0%
personally well I I think there's a
 
04:45:31.090 --> 04:45:31.100 align:start position:0%
couple ways to go on this first of all
 
04:45:33.770 --> 04:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
some consumers
 
04:45:33.780 --> 04:45:35.090 align:start position:0%
some consumers
ah

04:45:35.090 --> 04:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:45:37.368 --> 04:45:37.378 align:start position:0%
might want to fix you know the item
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
themselves they have some kind of
 
04:45:41.390 --> 04:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
ability and people like me
 
04:45:43.310 --> 04:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested I'm going to call the
 
04:45:46.190 --> 04:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
Maytag Man and that's that
 
04:45:49.010 --> 04:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and I want my cost to be less I don't
 
04:45:51.770 --> 04:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
want a higher cost and you I don't think
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
you can deny that if there's this
 
04:45:55.850 --> 04:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
mandate the costs are going to go higher
 
04:45:58.850 --> 04:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
so some people might want to actually
 
04:46:00.590 --> 04:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
pay for a higher price and then be able
 
04:46:02.448 --> 04:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
to fix it so they'd save money other
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
people like me I'm not taking a chance
 
04:46:08.150 --> 04:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'd mess it up and it will really be a
 
04:46:09.948 --> 04:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
disaster so
 
04:46:12.050 --> 04:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
let the market decide I mean there's
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
many products out there
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
um washing machines dishwasher there's
 
04:46:18.530 --> 04:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
all kinds of and there's you know
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
different programs available so I just
 
04:46:24.170 --> 04:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
think making a mandate is not the answer
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
and it is true items don't last like
 
04:46:30.410 --> 04:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
they used to I have an old TV but the
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
tubes and everything I'm not getting rid
 
04:46:34.850 --> 04:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
of it because I know those new fancy
 
04:46:39.530 --> 04:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
ones are they don't last that long so
 
04:46:42.288 --> 04:46:42.298 align:start position:0%
let the consumer decide I think there's
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
enough variety out there and that also
 
04:46:46.010 --> 04:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
was mentioned about this and for again
 
04:46:46.020 --> 04:46:47.448 align:start position:0%
was mentioned about this and for again
enforcement

04:46:47.448 --> 04:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:46:51.770 --> 04:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
I want my enforcement officials working
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
on real you know as I say murders and
 
04:46:57.530 --> 04:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
fraud real fraud this is not fraud by
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
the way uh you buy a product and you
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
hope it will last many many years but it
 
04:47:06.650 --> 04:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
may not sometimes it does sometimes it
 
04:47:08.030 --> 04:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't maybe you're going to get a
 
04:47:09.530 --> 04:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
warrant some people get the warranty
 
04:47:12.770 --> 04:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
program I don't I study it a lot and
 
04:47:14.570 --> 04:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
then I keep my fingers crossed that I
 
04:47:17.150 --> 04:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
made the right decision but
 
04:47:20.690 --> 04:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
um again Department of Justice and all
 
04:47:23.330 --> 04:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
this this to me should be on real crimes
 
04:47:25.550 --> 04:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
where there's really an attempt to
 
04:47:27.890 --> 04:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
defraud and there's this is nothing
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
about fraud it's just you want your
 
04:47:31.910 --> 04:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
products I think they have so many
 
04:47:34.368 --> 04:47:34.378 align:start position:0%
goodies on them now that they
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
I buy products that have less goodies on
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
them because the more goodies the more
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
things they're going to break so
 
04:47:41.638 --> 04:47:42.948 align:start position:0%
things they're going to break so
anyway

04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:47:47.208 --> 04:47:47.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh we do have a
 
04:47:51.050 --> 04:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
question representative Sullivan
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I just saw a quick clarification So
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
you you're saying it's going to increase
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of our appliances or the cost
 
04:47:58.850 --> 04:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
of repair
 
04:48:01.850 --> 04:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
I think if a mandate goes through it's
 
04:48:04.010 --> 04:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to be at it will be an added cost
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
to when you go to purchase it a
 
04:48:08.090 --> 04:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for the question
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
um so what would be the sort of the
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
channel through which you see the car
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
like what cost would increase on a
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that now
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
the material to fix it is made more
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
available well
 
04:48:23.628 --> 04:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
if they have to supply tools I believe
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
tools are mentioned in here uh
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
make them available that they didn't
 
04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
have to before that's something tools I
 
04:48:35.810 --> 04:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
mean the paperwork isn't a big deal and
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
most actually appliances now they don't
 
04:48:40.128 --> 04:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
even really give you the paperwork you
 
04:48:41.930 --> 04:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
actually have to pull it up online if
 
04:48:44.890 --> 04:48:44.900 align:start position:0%
you want but tools would actually be
 
04:48:47.930 --> 04:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
something significant and there's some
 
04:48:49.368 --> 04:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
question if it's training or whatever
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
too so uh
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's an extra cost it's going to be
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
added into the cost of the product I
 
04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:49:00.470 --> 04:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
in Parts two parts was mentioned right
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:08.208 --> 04:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you and I have this too
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay and having written testimony
 
04:49:12.288 --> 04:49:12.298 align:start position:0%
awesome make the court copy
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%

is more form of safety concerns it seeks
 
04:49:50.708 --> 04:49:50.718 align:start position:0%

open up the repair process any
 
04:50:15.170 --> 04:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
third-party have a significant impact on
 
04:50:16.730 --> 04:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
the safety liability of our products
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
could you talk slower please
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
and it opens up the three
 
04:50:21.120 --> 04:50:22.850 align:start position:0%
and it opens up the three
oh

04:50:22.850 --> 04:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'll go step back a second opening up
 
04:50:26.330 --> 04:50:26.340 align:start position:0%
the repair process to any third party
 
04:50:28.670 --> 04:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
could have a significant impact on the
 
04:50:31.250 --> 04:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
safety and liability of our products
 
04:50:32.930 --> 04:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
and it opens up the threat to
 
04:50:34.368 --> 04:50:34.378 align:start position:0%
significant property damage including
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
the instances we have heard of including
 
04:50:38.448 --> 04:50:38.458 align:start position:0%
using the wrong refrigerant using
 
04:50:40.430 --> 04:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
counterfeit Parts leading to leading to
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
electric shock that's why it is
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
Paramount to have authors who pay
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
professional who is trained to properly
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
hand our products to ensure the customer
 
04:50:49.090 --> 04:50:49.100 align:start position:0%
remains safe
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers will no longer have the
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
ability to properly assess with the
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
technicians entering the home
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
have met the necessary technical Safety
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
and Security checks make sure the
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
customer remains safe
 
04:51:02.628 --> 04:51:02.638 align:start position:0%
I do want to mention there isn't there
 
04:51:05.150 --> 04:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
is an issue at home appliance service
 
04:51:07.850 --> 04:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
repair industry about 20 000 across the
 
04:51:11.990 --> 04:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
country above those uh shops and 88 of
 
04:51:13.970 --> 04:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
those are local Mom and Pops repair
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
shops across the country
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
um so to conclude appliances are complex
 
04:51:21.550 --> 04:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
they require training and accountability
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
untrained repairs can compromise Safety
 
04:51:26.090 --> 04:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
and Security and as I know State as an
 
04:51:28.010 --> 04:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
active legislation that cover appliances
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
up to date with that I asked who to
 
04:51:31.310 --> 04:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
oppose house supposed to make three
 
04:51:34.250 --> 04:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:36.350 --> 04:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I guess oh
 
04:51:42.110 --> 04:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
we do have representative Ammon
 
04:51:44.090 --> 04:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for sure could you just please
 
04:51:46.850 --> 04:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
reiterate you said that no state to date
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
has passed the appliance provision yeah
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
so last year
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
two states in the U.S pass fair to
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
parallelization Colorado passed a
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
wheelchair right to repair
 
04:52:01.250 --> 04:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
and the New York as was mentioned
 
04:52:03.770 --> 04:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
previously passed the rectory Parable
 
04:52:06.650 --> 04:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
but explicitly excludes appliances so we
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
were not it's not part of that law so
 
04:52:11.650 --> 04:52:11.660 align:start position:0%
what did it cover so I I think it's like
 
04:52:14.030 --> 04:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
consumer electronics but there is you
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
can look at the law but the when they
