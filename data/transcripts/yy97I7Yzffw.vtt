recognized thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
just wondering if the committee might um
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
if the committee has considered
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
potentially a motion of interm study for
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
such a bill um given that we recognize
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
the importance of yava Voters getting
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
their ballots back in time and perhaps
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
that might be appropriate for um showing
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
good faith to look into uh um a secure
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
return of those ballots
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
electronically representative B yeah
 
01:02:04.029 --> 01:02:04.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh interim study
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
or itl I mean people can still work on
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
it and come up with another bill next
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
year it's you know if they want to you
 
01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
can meet on your own with other people
 
01:02:16.589 --> 01:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
and come up with a bill it's just that
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
interim study requires us as the
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
committee to get together and come up
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
with something but it still kills the
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
bill and and nothing prevents anybody
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
from coming up next year with a similar
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
bill with change as you want
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
to pass and I believe there was an
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to that we have to have a
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
second to the motion of ought to pass
 
01:04:36.589 --> 01:04:36.599 align:start position:0%

01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
0624 uh to Amendment H or to HB
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
13 this would uh ensure that we could
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually still email the uh copy of the
 
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:03.640 align:start position:0%
checklist to people who request it in
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format which is uh currently
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
unavailable uh giving them two free
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
requests per election meaning that if
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
they're running for say a local town
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
office they can request it twice then uh
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
in case you know one copy is uh damaged
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
or lost uh and they can then request two
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
more copies if they're running for say
 
01:05:27.559 --> 01:05:28.710 align:start position:0%
more copies if they're running for say
state

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh after that point towns
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
May charge a fee up to $25 as is the
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
current uh pricing system for these uh
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
checklists uh so this just kind of
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
enables us to have electronic formats
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
available uh so that we can do so in a
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
manner that prevents uh any abuse of the
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
system uh that pretty much summarizes it
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh and I hope that you support the
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
amendment thank
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%

representative Brendon is recognized
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to remind
 
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
the committee of the
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
highlighted that this bill trusts the
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
Challenger more than it trusts the voter
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
who is trying to exercise their right to
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
vote and I think that is problematic
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
with this bill and I would urge my
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote no on the ought to
 
01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:49.829 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote no on the ought to
pass

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
motion there further discussion on the
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass on House Bill
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
1569 representative Lanes
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair I I would
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
also just remind everybody that um
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's an affidavit for uh
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
proving there is currently an affidavit
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
for proving that you are a US citizen
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
this removes that which um we heard in
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
testimony is probably
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so I would raise that
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
issue and I think we also uh recently
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
received an email all of us on the
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh questioning uh how it might
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
um take us out of uh some it's it's
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
against Federal statutes both Hava and I
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
think it's the um right to vote act so I
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
would just raise those and say that
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
maybe we need a little more work to
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
study this um before we uh vote
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
ourselves into what probably will be a
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%

inexpedient to legisl on house B 1569 I

did I hear that right okay uh with that
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
we are on the motion of uh inexpedient
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
to legislate on House Bill 1569 is there
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
a discussion on the
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
motion um I'll make one discussion I'll
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
be voting against the motion of in
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
expedience legislate voter ID is very
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
popular um we've made some strides in
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
moving away from the ridiculous system
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
of showing up Boy Scout honoring your
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
way to a ballot um the recent Associated
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
Press poll showed that even 50% of
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
registered Democrats support voter ID um
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
this Bill gets us closer to voter ID
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
which I know members will dis disagree
 
01:12:27.390 --> 01:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
with um but I think it's very reasonable
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
that if you're showing up to vote that
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
you carry a basic form of ID most people
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
drive to the polls you need an ID to buy
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
cold medicine you need an ID to get on a
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
train you need an ID to get onto a plane
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
um you need an ID to do basically
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
everything except for cast about in the
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um so with that I
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
will be opposing the motion of 1569 I'm
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
sure someone will have a rebuttal but I
 
01:12:49.709 --> 01:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
won't be speaking to it
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
again yes representative
 
01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
plan I I couldn't resists so um I would
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
remind you that the reason that we have
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
the same day affidavits is because we
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
have a um we've been excused for lack of
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
a better term from the Motor Voter Rule
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have same day
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
affidavits if we go this route we will
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
lose that exemption and we will need to
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
do all the requirements of Motor Voter
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
and at the last time we talked about
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
this my recollection is that the
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles said that
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
it would cost over a million dollars to
 
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.790 align:start position:0%
it would cost over a million dollars to
do

01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
that yes represent quy thank you Mr
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I believe that in order to get
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
an accurate assessment of public
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
sentiment we do have to ensure we have
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
an obligation to ensure that all
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
qualified voters have the opportunity to
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
cast a ballot however we are equally
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
obligated to ensure that only qualified
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
voters get to cast a ballot so that we
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
can prevent delution of of the franchise
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
for those qualified
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
voters so I am going to vote no on this
 
01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.229 align:start position:0%
voters so I am going to vote no on this
thank

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
you further discussion on the bill
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you Mr
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
chair I will remind the committee that
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
there is no widespread voter fraud and
 
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
voters that show up to vote are
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
qualified voters this bill would allow
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits for challenging the
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
voter um but does not allow affidavit
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
for the voter themselves and again is
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
trusting the Challenger more than the
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
voter trying to exercise their right to
 
01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
vote it still maintains affidavits just
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
not for the voter themselves only for
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
the people that are trying to stop them
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
from voting this is a barrier to
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
exercising again the right to vote we've
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
also heard testimony about um the
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
housing crisis here in New Hampshire
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about individuals
 
01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
suffering um extreme circumstances where
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
their home has burned down and they did
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
not have the
 
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate um identification that's
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
laid out in this bill but nonetheless
 
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
still has the right to
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
exercise uh still has the right to vote
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so again for all of these reasons I
 
01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
would urge my colleagues to vote
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%

open the executive session for House
Bill

01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
1098 relative to ballots delivered to
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
Elder Care Facilities uh I will make a
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass on House Bill
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
1098 is there a second I second that
 
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
representative Pam O'Brien seconds um
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'll speak very briefly to this bill um
 
01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is just authorizing language
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandate it's not a
 
01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
requirement um I actually think it's
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
more appropriate that the clerk their
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
Deputy handles these um when possible so
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with authorizing
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
language it's not a mandate um so that's
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
why I'll be supporting it if if it was a
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
mandate I would probably oppose it um
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not it just allows it and says
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
that they can do it so with that I'm I'm
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
fine passing it um so that's my motion
 
01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass on
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%

01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
second second representative Wy second

Bill 1310 is there discussion on the
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
rather yes yes sorry thank you you you
 
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
got to hold I've got two people leing I
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
get higher than Lane okay that's my
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
goal this bill requires uh the
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist to meet
 
01:22:04.990 --> 01:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
more often and I don't think it's it's
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's an honorous request I think that's
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
this is doable and I think this is a
 
01:22:09.199 --> 01:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
this is doable and I think this is a
good

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
thing further
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
discussion represent of Lane yes you got
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
you got to hold your so the the clerk in
 
01:22:19.709 --> 01:22:19.719 align:start position:0%
her diligence leans forwards to write
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
her notes so I can't see you guys to my
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.719 --> 01:22:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
out

01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
um so um I'll be voting against um um
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
OTP and the main reason is that a lot of
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
Clerks and supervisors already do this
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
but particularly in the smaller towns
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
and the rural areas um they don't have
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
the Staffing or um they don't need to do
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
this because they only have thousand
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
voters at the most so um for that reason
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
um I'll be voting against um a to
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
pass further discussion on the motion of
 
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.440 align:start position:0%

of article 2B and an individual's right
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
to privacy all of this data is going to
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
be shared and I'm not sure that it's
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional to do so thank you there
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the yes PR Brian
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I had concerns about this
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
being an organization that is not
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
completely transparent they have an
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
office but who knows where it is because
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about their privacy
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
all of this data that's being collected
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
is this a data
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
mining SK situation what is this for
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is I'm concerned about that and my
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%

did some research on this and my big
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
question is if this is so good why are
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
states leaving and it's also some some
 
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
concern that this is a George Soros
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
organization I hav improved one way or
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
another but just by the purpose of
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
States leaving why are they leaving if
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%

the data that is hashed so that it can't
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
be hacked and not claim that there is a
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
right to privacy for so many other
 
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
things that are dealt with on the house
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
floor and in many other committees is
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
hypocritical and I I'm appalled that we
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
would be using that to as an
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
argument to stop something that would
 
01:27:45.109 --> 01:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
benefit our election officials that
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
would increase the accuracy of our voter
 
01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:49.239 align:start position:0%
roles increase
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
efficiency and make sure that no one is
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
is voting in more than one location
 
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
which I am aware that there are many
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
people on this committee who have those
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
concerns and we have seen many bills
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
that try to address those concerns that
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for people to
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
vote this bill does not make it more
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to vote but it does
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
allow for checking for fraudulent
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
activity in voting and make sure that we
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
duplicative uh voters whether it is in
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
any of our neighboring states that are
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
also members of Eric um or whether it is
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
in towns within our state this is a
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
proven secure reliable system it is run
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
by the member states not by a shady
 
01:28:49.870 --> 01:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
organization I take issue with the
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
mention of George Soros being being a
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
reason to reject this bill that is
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
frankly anti-semitic rhetoric and I will
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
not accept that argument I'm going to
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the member's out of order for that um
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
that you can challenge the ruling of the
 
01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
chair we're not going to be we're not
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to be that's
 
01:29:12.510 --> 01:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so you you may continue
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
but do not Levy out do not Levy
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
allegations like that it's inappropriate
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
my apologies Mr chair I I apologize I I
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
do take offense I apolog oliz for taking
 
01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
offense but uh I do so
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
regardless um this is a proven
 
01:29:34.109 --> 01:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan system I'm I'm sad that there
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
are members on this committee that don't
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that it is bipartisan there
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
are many states that have pulled out in
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
the recent in recent years that are now
 
01:29:46.790 --> 01:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
looking to join back in there are at
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
least six states that are in the process
 
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
of joining so while there may have been
 
01:29:56.990 --> 01:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh The Exodus of nine Republican states
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
in the past some of those are indeed
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
looking to get back in and I would urge
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
the committee to recognize the
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh organization the
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
bipartisan state run member state run
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%

committee that this is a bipartison
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
member state run organization that
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
increases the accuracy of our voter
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%

election workers it is is the only
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
proven reliable secure data system to
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%

01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%

01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
voter
 
01:32:06.109 --> 01:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
fraud thank you and I would urge all to
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
pass further discussion on the motion of
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass um I'll give my quick
 
01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this um I do believe this is
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
a violation of article 2B um I consider
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
my driver's license number I consider my
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
last four digits of my social security
 
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
number um I consider the fact that
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
government Warehouse is my birth date I
 
01:32:23.790 --> 01:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
consider those three pieces of
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
informations together to be personally
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
identifying information um if this was a
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
federal contract you would need level 5c
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
clearance to handle that information um
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
so it is a violation uh I have I will
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
make the statement now if this bill ever
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
becomes law I will probably be one of
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
the first joiners of a lawsuit against
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
the state for giving my what I believe
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
is my private information to a third
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
party Eric is in fact a third party um
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
it does not matter that it is run by
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
member states it is a third party party
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
this is the state giving your
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
information albeit baby securely to a
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
third party that sharing of information
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
we would not allow for anything else um
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
so um I I will note we the committee did
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
receive a letter from member states
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
urging us to join Eric uh one of those
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
signers was a secretary of state of
 
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
Kentucky who just two weeks ago
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
announced that Kentucky will be leaving
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
Eric in a year so one of the members
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
that signed us encouraging us to join is
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
now revers course and is they themselves
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
in the process of leaving um so that
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
those are my thoughts um with that the
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
clerk will call the role on House Bill
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
on the motion of ought to pass on House
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%

a vote of 10 to 10 uh House Bill 1557
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
will be reported out without

recommendation um I imagine

01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
okay trying to see what else we have
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
with that doesn't need amending just
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
11:46 uh we a reverse course on that so
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
we can take a votee on it um sure
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
um going to open up the executive
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
session on
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
1146 I will make a motion of ought to
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.109 --> 01:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
second I second representative katab
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
seconds the motion of ought to pass on
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
11:46 um I I don't want to beat this to
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
death um this bill is kind of personal
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
to me because I actually tried at one
 
01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
point to get my name off the voter
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
checklist and you can't do it um so I
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
wish there was a cleaner less
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
controversial way um there are sometimes
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
very legitimate reasons people want off
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
the voter checklist um and um this kind
 
01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
of prescribes that is it perfect I don't
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
know um but we need to start we need to
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
find a mechanism to make that happen
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
when a voter wants to do that um I do
 
01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
have First Amendment concerns um with
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
forcing somebody to stay on the voter
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
checklist um I don't think those are as
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
strong as just I think you should have a
 
01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
right to take your name off if you so
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
choose um can it be abused probably
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
definitely but I think you have a right
 
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
to get your name off there if you want
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
it off so um with that does anybody else
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
want to talk about this 1146 right yes
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
represent plan um I I will just raise
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
that the um Clerk's Association and the
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State are have reservations
 
01:36:17.070 --> 01:36:17.080 align:start position:0%
severe reservations about this bill and
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
um it there's no limit on the time that
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
you can do this and if you really want
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
to get off the register then don't vote
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
for a couple years and it will go
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
off that
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that that period of voting would be
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
10 years uh provided that 10 years does
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
not fall within the last four years of
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%

would like to speak to your motion
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bron yes please um this
 
01:42:01.310 --> 01:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses all of the concerns
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
that were brought up during the hearing
 
01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
um it has simplified the bill quite a
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
bit um it maintains that intent must be
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
proven by a
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutor um harmful intent which we
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
know is a high bar but I think it's
 
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
important to recognize that there are
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
people out there that will spread what
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
may be considered public
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
information with the intent to harm an
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
election official in fact we've heard
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that many election
 
01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
officials um have received threats
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
against them it makes it harder to
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
recruit election workers um in a
 
01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
contentious environment and divisive
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
environment this bill seeks and this
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
amendment seeks to
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
um deter the use of
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
doxing which would be revealing personal
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
information with the intent to um harm
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
the election worker and so I believe
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
that this amendment does make the bill
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
better and I would encourage everyone to
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on the amendment and
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
then otpa further discussion on the
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
amendment okay um I'm going to vote for
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment because we've always had a
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
long-standing agreement um where we
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
allow amendments even though we may have
 
01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
veh disagreements with the underlying
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill um so I will be voting for the
 
01:43:34.350 --> 01:43:34.360 align:start position:0%
amendment um but you can imagine giving
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
my vote of the previous motion uh where
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
I will be on the final
 
01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
bill but with that the Madam clerk will
 
01:43:46.109 --> 01:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%

discussion on the bill as amended Is
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
there further discussion on the bill as
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
you have represent Brennan thank you Mr
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
chair I also want to highlight that this
 
01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.470 align:start position:0%
chair I also want to highlight that this
bill

01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
um is aiming to catch anybody
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
tampering with uh ballot counting
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
devices and this creates a penalty uh in
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
fact it is a Class B misdemeanor for
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
failing to comply with this section um
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
about tampering with ballot counting
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
devices which I know is also a priority
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
for some members in this committee and I
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
think that we all would want to prevent
 
01:45:40.109 --> 01:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
tampering of ballot counting
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
devices so in addition to trying to
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
prevent um doxing of election workers
 
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
which we know is critical to uh our
 
01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
elections being run efficiently as
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
always we they do such a good job but if
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have any election workers
 
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
available then our elections won't be
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
efficient so we need to do everything we
 
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
can to support them this bill supports
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
election workers holds people
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
accountable if there's any tampering I
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
would urge the committee to vote to pass
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
please fur the discussion on the bill as
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
amended um I will be voting against this
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill um there's parts of it that I like
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
I actually wish the tampering with an
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
election device was a felony not a clasy
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor um but the um the biggest
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
issue for me and it's it's it's an
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate truth which is when somebody
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
becomes a clerk or a moderator they're
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
working an election they are a public
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
official there you give up some of that
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
right to privacy when that happens um um
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
my address is on the general Courts
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
website um it's on my campaign website
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
um it's just one of those things if
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
people want to find me they can um so
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's my one of my principal cons uh
 
01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
objections to this is you know I I think
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
our poll workers I think bluntly I think
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have been acting very
 
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriately in the pulse um a lot of
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
people that happen to be sometimes from
 
01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
my side of the aisle um and I don't it's
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
to deescalate um this isn't the solution
 
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
to that problem I think um but that's
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
kind of my general statement is is part
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
of a core a core part of this country
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
and this state is a peaceful transition
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
of power part of that peaceful
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
transition of power is a peaceful voting
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
process people need to accept the
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
results of elections they cannot be
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
hotheaded in the polls um I appreciate
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
this bill for kind of what it's like its
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
idea um I just don't think it gets there
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
for me so I'll be voting against it uh
 
01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
but I do appreciate it coming forward um
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
I do want to to I did want to say I do
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
think I do value our election workers
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
they do they are stepping up it is
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
getting harder and harder to do that job
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
it is getting more and more contentious
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
to do that job um and I I appreciate
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
where this bill was trying to go I just
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's just not ready it's not there for
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
me yet so further discussions on this
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill on the motion of ought to pass as
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
amended representative br
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
your words and support of election
 
01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:27.639 align:start position:0%
workers um and recognizing how difficult
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
it is for election workers um I just
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
want to point out
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
that the point of this bill while there
 
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
may be public information like a
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
person's home address um these are
 
01:48:41.239 --> 01:48:42.350 align:start position:0%
person's home address um these are
largely

01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
largely
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers and if someone were to say on
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
social media so and so election work
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
lives at this address would hate to
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
see any harm come to them uh with the
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
intent of someone doing harm to that
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
election official this bill would hold
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
that person accountable and so I just
 
01:49:07.870 --> 01:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that it is not a
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
matter of Simply sharing public
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
information it is with the intent to
 
01:49:18.189 --> 01:49:18.199 align:start position:0%
cause harm to that election worker um
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
and that is a high bar for a prosecutor
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
to prove in court but I think this takes
 
01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
a step in the right direction to
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
providing um protections that our
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
election officials and our election

representative Lane is recognized for a
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%

02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
1384
 
02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
I move that um this be found uh
 
02:05:24.629 --> 02:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislate representative Ward seconds is
 
02:05:30.669 --> 02:05:30.679 align:start position:0%
there just uh I believe representative
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
weary wanted to speak to
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
this yes Mr chair thank you very much
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
just uh to clarify originally when as it
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
was originally proposed the bill sought
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
to kind of Remedy the
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
um what could be perceived as some gaps
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
if there was misconduct by uh uh clerks
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
or moderators and again I I want to
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
reiterate what I said in the testimony
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
there I do not think that is a uh
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
widespread problem at all I I think it's
 
02:06:07.549 --> 02:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
actually the reverse that there are many
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
great moderators and clerks who
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
diligently perform their jobs but that
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
there are is a potential for a few bad
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
actors but um in um looking at the
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
rsas uh the infamous chapter 666 has
 
02:06:27.149 --> 02:06:27.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions for the purity of Elections
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think for people who are
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing um concerns about
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
non-compliance or other things they
 
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
should follow that where there is
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions for uh official malfeasance
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
and official misconduct for election
 
02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
officials should that ever be the case
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
in our safe and secure elections here in
 
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:50.830 align:start position:0%
in our safe and secure elections here in
New

02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:50.840 align:start position:0%

my attention uh during public hearing uh
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
on the first page uh line 29 the word
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%

able to do it to do the whole process in
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
time if it was a year ending in one and
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%

copies to the speaker of the house and
 
02:09:44.669 --> 02:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate um before it
 
02:09:48.510 --> 02:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
had been a carryover from the um uh the
 
02:09:51.229 --> 02:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh stat the the previous bill that I
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
introduced that was a statute rather

uh representative weary moves amendment
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
20248 n4h to House Bill 1348 is there a
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
second representative Burnham I believe
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
a seconding yes I am thank you okay
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
representative weie would you like to
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the amendment yes as thank you
 
02:16:08.549 --> 02:16:08.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair as originally proposed the um
 
02:16:10.709 --> 02:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
language in the original Bill talked
 
02:16:13.709 --> 02:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
about negating the race and that sort of
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
thing and that seemed to be excessive
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
but the principle be behind it um a
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
situation where the total count of the
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
cast ballots exceeded the number of
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
registered voters seems to Warrant
 
02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
further review when such an event occurs
 
02:16:33.389 --> 02:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
so um this amendment changes it to the
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
um and moves it to the recount RSA where
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
if um the total count of cast ballots
 
02:16:43.309 --> 02:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
were to exceed the number of registered
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
voters on the day of election for any
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
race um then the that person could
 
02:16:51.709 --> 02:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
petition for a recount following the
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
normal uh Provisions for that and this
 
02:16:59.750 --> 02:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be specific to um a candidate on
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
the ballot where this event occurred so
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
um even if that candidates race wasn't
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily directly affected at that
 
02:17:12.629 --> 02:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
point if there was a uh odity or anomaly
 
02:17:15.150 --> 02:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
where uh the cast ballots exceeded
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
registered voters I think there should
 
02:17:20.429 --> 02:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
be a provision for examining that a
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
little uh more closely so that's why
 
02:17:26.509 --> 02:17:26.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.669 --> 02:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
offered further discussion on the
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
Hamlet um thank you Mr chairman so I
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
think it's actually impossible to have
 
02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
the number of cast ballots exceed the
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
number of registered
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
voters um so if that did happen it would
 
02:17:46.469 --> 02:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
definitely be an error and there should
 
02:17:48.509 --> 02:17:48.519 align:start position:0%
definitely be a recap account which a
 
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
candidate could request anyway I don't
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
think we need this law to allow that so
 
02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
my my rebuttal to that would be we do
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
actually limit who can request a recount
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:04.709 align:start position:0%
I believe
um

02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
so yeah because it's not uh and I know I
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
know that's the case in primaries um
 
02:18:12.429 --> 02:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
because that's been raised to me before
 
02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
which was um somebody somebody actually
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out I think it was like less
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
than 1% or something like that they can
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
they actually cannot request a recount a
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
primary um so there it's I agree with
 
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
you in principle except it's not that
 
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
cut and dry um and I do think I do think
 
02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill accomplishes the objective of
 
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
if this I don't believe the situation
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
has ever occurred in New Hampshire thank
 
02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:37.709 align:start position:0%
has ever occurred in New Hampshire thank
god

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
god
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah but if it did I I it it's
 
02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
hard it's hard to vote against something
 
02:18:46.389 --> 02:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
that if it did happen would be so absurd
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
that it would clearly an indication that
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
something went wrong whether it's
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or negligence or like
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
something obviously there's more ballots
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
cast in the registered voters like
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
something went wrong so U I think this
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
is actually
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
a a very
 
02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable I don't say like middle
 
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
ground but solution to a something that
 
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
I pray to God is never actually a
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
problem representative Bal yeah it
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened in New Hampshire but it
 
02:19:17.230 --> 02:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
has happened in other states some years
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
ago go in Washington state Kings count
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
Kings County which is Seattle even after
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
they did all the recounts and everything
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
else and it still came out that the
 
02:19:33.070 --> 02:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
number of ballots cast was 10% more than
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
the registered voters in that county and
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
it just went by like it was I mean not
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
judge didn't rule that you had to do in
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
the reelection but it has happened in
 
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.429 align:start position:0%
the reelection but it has happened in
other

02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%

amendment uh this amendment is the same
 
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment you saw last week minus the
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
typo I think I hope um so if you could
 
02:34:35.230 --> 02:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
please review it
 
02:34:38.910 --> 02:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
um but I got rid of the cast ballot was
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
requested cast in um just requested in
 
02:34:45.150 --> 02:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
so this opens it up to it's the same
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's the same as the bill that I
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
presented but it cleaned up the language
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit to be more precise I
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%

katab we're now on discussion motion of
 
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
L to pass uh I believe representative
 
02:38:09.469 --> 02:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
katab is getting an amendment for this
 
02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
bill um representative kab I know we
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the amendment yet but would
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
like to describe what you are attempting
 
02:38:17.269 --> 02:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
to do in the
 
02:38:20.429 --> 02:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
amendment sure so basically the part
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
where it just says that everybody that
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
all the newspapers are required to give
 
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
a copy of their rates to the Secretary
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
of State I was just removing that line
 
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
because we've heard some off the Record
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
Rumblings that that's not so much
 
02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
happening anyways um but we'd be leaving
 
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
the line where it it does state that you
 
02:38:41.389 --> 02:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
know you can't charge one candidate
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
something different so that you couldn't
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
charge you know a republican more than a
 
02:38:46.309 --> 02:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
Democrat or vice Versa for the
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
advertising rates we'd still be leaving
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
that line in there um so that's all the
 
02:38:52.110 --> 02:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is looking to do and I should
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
have it very shortly yes I expect it to
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
be shortly but I wanted to have a
 
02:38:58.110 --> 02:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
discussion on it before yes
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lane um I'm wondering if
 
02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
we want to delay this and see if we want
 
02:39:07.269 --> 02:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
to fold it
 
02:39:13.550 --> 02:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
into six the 1091 Bill and that way it's
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
because we've been talking about doing
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
just that
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
correct so I I had that thought um and I
 
02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's entirely flawed logic
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
my my one thing that I my caveat that I
 
02:39:29.469 --> 02:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
would add to that is if campaign Finance
 
02:39:31.550 --> 02:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
form is a is a tough nut to crack to
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
begin with um and even if we get it out
 
02:39:36.269 --> 02:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
of the house which is an if we're
 
02:39:38.230 --> 02:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
working hard I think we will but it's an
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
if the Senate can do what the Senate
 
02:39:44.710 --> 02:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
does um and I don't think that we should
 
02:39:49.269 --> 02:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
let this okay go down on the hopes that
 
02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
they'll pass the larger package but I I
 
02:39:53.910 --> 02:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
do I had that that very thought did
 
02:39:55.389 --> 02:39:55.399 align:start position:0%
cross my mind and I think it's a very
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable point of view um but I just
 
02:40:01.110 --> 02:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh I just thought I've had I've had many
 
02:40:02.510 --> 02:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
a bill go to the other side of the wall
 
02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
to meet a swift a swift demise um so yes
 
02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
that that is what representative katab
 
02:40:11.230 --> 02:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
is suggesting does anybody do any the
 
02:40:13.269 --> 02:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
members have any comments on that so
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
basically going to get rid of the
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
requirements that they report to the
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State their rates um which
 
02:40:25.590 --> 02:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
I think is I I don't think that's
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
being I I don't think it's being overly
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
used right now um I also think the print
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
media industry
 
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
is already struggling enough as it is um
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to have
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
a a a regulation like that uh the FCC
 
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
and the Fe do have provision
 
02:40:50.429 --> 02:40:50.439 align:start position:0%
for um Equitable rates for broadcast
 
02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
already so we are a little bit
 
02:40:54.140 --> 02:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
duplicative in that
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:55.389 align:start position:0%
duplicative in that
[Music]

02:40:55.389 --> 02:40:55.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
um so but it does leave in the Clause
 
02:41:00.910 --> 02:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
that you can't charge a differential
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
rate so I'm sorry yes represent um so
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
were you able to verify with the
 
02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that they're not in
 
02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
these I don't want to call anybody out
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
of the struggling media but there are
 
02:41:21.389 --> 02:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
several who are currently not giving
 
02:41:23.070 --> 02:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
such to the Secretary of State that
 
02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah and that's a
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
transparency thing which I I get um but
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
I just don't uh print media used to be
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
the pre the premier media um is no
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
longer um and I don't think uh I don't
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
think we need to over regulate them
 
02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
already they're already working hard as
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
it is so anyways uh when we get that
 
02:41:53.469 --> 02:41:53.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment back we will uh we will adopt
 
02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
we will I'm sorry we'll take a vote on
 
02:41:56.670 --> 02:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
it but I wanted to at least have that
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
discussion does representative Lane do
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
you think You' be agreeable to that
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
concept I guess I want to read the yeah
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
you want to read read the amendment and
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
I may need to caucus with the group okay
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
but no initial oppos I I you reserve the
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
right to be opposed but no initial
 
02:42:16.110 --> 02:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
opposition okay can I just make a quick
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
comment of course um just for some
 
02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
background on the media industry for
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
most major networks um the rate cards
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
are already available um via the website
 
02:42:29.750 --> 02:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
or you know reach out via email so even
 
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
if they're not being
 
02:42:34.429 --> 02:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
reported by Common statute you can find
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
them pretty easily
 
02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
yeah another point of concern for me for
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
this was with digital advertising um
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
some of them offer operate on an auction
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
based system a live auction system basis
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
basically real time auction system so
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
they have no ability to actually publish
 
02:42:51.469 --> 02:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
the rate because it's changing literally
 
02:42:55.230 --> 02:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
every second um so and as you guys know
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
I have said before I I really strive to
 
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
treat all mediums as closely as the same
 
02:43:03.230 --> 02:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
as possible um because it reduces
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
confusion then you don't end up with 664
 
02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
being 58 Pages um so anyways all right
 
02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:12.330 align:start position:0%
so we will recess that we'll come back
 
02:43:12.330 --> 02:43:13.750 align:start position:0%
so we will recess that we'll come back
[Music]

02:43:13.750 --> 02:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and we'll try we're going to break
 
02:43:19.230 --> 02:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
for lunch um we'll come back and we'll
 
02:43:19.240 --> 02:43:22.349 align:start position:0%
for lunch um we'll come back and we'll
do

02:43:22.349 --> 02:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.950 --> 02:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
1085 um 1523 if there's
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
agreement 1150 with Amendment and then
 
02:43:31.150 --> 02:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
we will if we have time we'll discuss
 
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
1091 does that work for you
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
anything uh I have a lunch meeting that
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
goes till one so we'll have to be back
 
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
anyways sorry to inconvenience for of
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
your head trying all right we'll see you
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%

o'

04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%

04:05:08.110 --> 04:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment then we can
 
04:05:11.149 --> 04:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment um representative
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
katabi recognized for the purpose of
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:19.910 --> 04:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr chairman I'd like
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
d958 all right I'll second it
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
um as we described the question I think
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
I need to send to the clerk is the last
 
04:05:35.229 --> 04:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
line 18 and
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
19 is erroneous look like it's just an
 
04:05:39.950 --> 04:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
error from
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
OS um yeah I'm gonna message them right
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
now and just ask
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
um but she did say that the title need
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
to be replaced but I do see now up top
 
04:05:51.950 --> 04:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
that it is also up there so let me just
 
04:05:53.469 --> 04:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
send her a quick
 
04:05:53.479 --> 04:05:56.710 align:start position:0%
send her a quick
email

04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah no that's the amended analysis
 
04:06:01.389 --> 04:06:01.399 align:start position:0%
behind it that that's just analysis
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not that's not actual
 
04:06:09.870 --> 04:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
verbiage um it just look like uh are you
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
did you are you sending them an email
 
04:06:11.000 --> 04:06:12.269 align:start position:0%
did you are you sending them an email
right

04:06:12.269 --> 04:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:06:12.279 --> 04:06:14.630 align:start position:0%
right
now

04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:06:17.229 --> 04:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
actually yeah let me grab Christina or
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
Carrie and maybe they can offer some
 
04:06:21.149 --> 04:06:21.159 align:start position:0%
insight we have a procedural question
 
04:06:22.429 --> 04:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
here so we've got this
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and it looks like OSS just put
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
like a weird line at the very last like
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
they added to the end of the amendment
 
04:06:30.510 --> 04:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
amend the title of the bill by replacing
 
04:06:32.349 --> 04:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
with the following and there's nothing
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
after it like very clearly they just
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
forgot to delete it do we need a whole
 
04:06:42.710 --> 04:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
that they'll fix it through an
 
04:06:44.439 --> 04:06:46.670 align:start position:0%
that they'll fix it through an
enrollment

04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
04:06:46.680 --> 04:06:49.750 align:start position:0%
enrollment
process

04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.149 --> 04:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's just a
 
04:06:52.159 --> 04:06:53.870 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's just a
typo

04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
typo
 
04:06:56.630 --> 04:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I think that that was my
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
operate like it's not up for debate like
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's clear that's supposed to be there
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah space even between the period and
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
the a yeah so all right
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
got no no they they changed the title of
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
the bill but they did that up top yeah
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's just an erroneous extra
 
04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
line that just needs to be deleted and
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
the question is is do we have to send it
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
back to LS get them to draft a new
 
04:07:30.189 --> 04:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
amendment number or can they just fix
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
that and an enroll bills process and we
 
04:07:33.710 --> 04:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
can just move on with our day I'm hoping
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
we can just move on with our day
 
04:07:36.720 --> 04:07:38.309 align:start position:0%
we can just move on with our day
um

04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't did we uh did we receive our
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
re our researcher things seems to think
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
they'll fix that in the enrolled bills
 
04:07:53.710 --> 04:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
process so they're going to fix it now
 
04:07:54.790 --> 04:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
with the same number and they're going
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
to email it in a second so if we just
 
04:07:59.149 --> 04:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
wait it'll be the same number if we just
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
wait to vote on it for one second until
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
they email us the corrected copy then
 
04:08:07.109 --> 04:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have voted and they're okay to
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
correct it now now okay um so every we
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
have a great weekend and doing anything
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
fun uh I guess we'll stand in recess for
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.600 --> 04:11:21.389 align:start position:0%
 
in

04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.990 --> 04:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
gonna we're going to come back in out of
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
recess uh the member has forwarded an
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
updated copy without the um erroneous
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
line in 18 and 19 um without objection
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say this is sufficient um
 
04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
you can check your email to exactly what
 
04:11:40.510 --> 04:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
I described it as um so we are still on
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment um without
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
the line the the erroneous line amend

close the executive session on house
 
04:14:18.990 --> 04:14:19.000 align:start position:0%

going to
 
04:14:19.800 --> 04:14:28.750 align:start position:0%

um okay all right
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%

04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
today we'll recess the rest of this and
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
um well we have so left on the noticed
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
on the docket left for today is 1080
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
House of Bill
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
1085 House Bill
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
1523 and House Bill
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
1091 um I'm not sensing a large desire
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
to say and work on 1091 which is my game
 
04:14:58.750 --> 04:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
plan um so with that I'm just going to
 
04:15:00.429 --> 04:15:00.439 align:start position:0%
open and close and we're going to go
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
home this with without you have
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
something else you want 1085 that's
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to push it I think
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
because there's an amendment
 
04:15:10.109 --> 04:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want I don't want to hang
 
04:15:16.149 --> 04:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
of right okay uh so I'm going to open up
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill 1085
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
and recess it and then I'm going to open
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
up the executive session House Bill 1091
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
and recess it uh and I will open up the
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
executive session I've already done 1523
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
um okay with that I believe that
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
concludes our business for the day
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody um we'll see you uh we
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
will not be meeting on Tuesday we will
 
04:15:39.990 --> 04:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
likely meet on on Monday um so probably
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
going to meet on Monday of next week and
 
04:15:43.510 --> 04:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
that will be I'll probably do all votes
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
that day so we need to have basically
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
everything done okay right
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.349 --> 04:15:58.359 align:start position:0%
try uh Monday Monday Monday because we
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
cannot meet on Tuesday at what time Mr
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
probably 10: a.m. I haven't scheduled it
 
04:16:03.990 --> 04:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
yet so you're going to notice I'm just
 
04:16:05.710 --> 04:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
giving you a heads up I'm going to do
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
Monday I'm probably going to do 10 a.m.
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
but could be with is there a reason we
 
04:16:12.630 --> 04:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
need to meet next week and not the
 
04:16:14.429 --> 04:16:14.439 align:start position:0%
following week yes I I want to be done
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
with our business so the scheduling is
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
at my discretion so I'm I was just
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:17:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
Monday

04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
