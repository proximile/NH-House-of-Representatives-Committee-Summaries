take any
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%

recommendation of the full committee
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
of itl ought to pass or it can be
 
00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:48.409 align:start position:0%
of itl ought to pass or it can be
amended

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't know what
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
you typically do in this committee
 
00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 align:start position:0%
um do you like poll everybody and say
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
how do you think about this or or do I
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
just make a motion or you could just
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
make a motion if you'd like and see
 
00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 align:start position:0%
where it goes okay well then I'll make a
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
motion of Ito
 
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.990 align:start position:0%
motion of Ito
second

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has moved itl
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin is second It Is
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
there further discussion
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I would be voting in opposition
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
to the itl motion I would be in favor of
 
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
OTP because I think a commitment was
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
made to our municipalities long ago the
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
state reneged on the uh commitment after
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
the municipalities took a action in
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
Reliance on that commitment and I think
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
at a very minimum what's requested here
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
of 7.5 percent for the uh future seems
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
um appropriate and far less than what
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:10.139 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Hewitt
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
now I I joined in that comment and I'm
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
also going to vote in opposition to the
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
motion now this is something that went
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
back to 1967 and came forward getting
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
worse and worse as it went along and I
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
think that the employees were
 
00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:31.259 align:start position:0%
promised at back way back in the day
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
that the for the commitment that the
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
legislature made would be carried
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
forward so I think that ought to happen
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you any further comment
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I guess I should
 
00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
speak to my emotions
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
so I I'll talk about two parts to this
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
one is the commitment aspect and and one
 
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
is the details of of how this bill
 
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
spends money
 
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.330 align:start position:0%
spends money
so

00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
in general I think that
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
um things that previous legislatures did
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
go into law and they tend to stick
 
00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
around until those laws are changed
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
based on current circumstances so when
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 1967 55 years ago
 
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.950 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 1967 55 years ago
right

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.930 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:22.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
somehow the the actions of those
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
legislators who are dealing with their
 
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.020 align:start position:0%
current circumstances
 
00:08:32.769 --> 00:08:32.779 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
Primacy over us and our current
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
circumstances and what we think is right
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire right we
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
were elected to deal with current uh
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
budgets current expenses Etc and so
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
because people 55 years ago made a
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
certain decision I don't see how that
 
00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.710 align:start position:0%
certain decision I don't see how that
somehow

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
controls us I mean if they wanted to
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
they could put that sort of decision I
 
00:09:02.449 --> 00:09:02.459 align:start position:0%
mean to make that sort of a decision
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
permanent or semi-permanent it would
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
have to be in the Constitution the
 
00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
Constitution is what controls the
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislature right and and limits it and
 
00:09:16.009 --> 00:09:16.019 align:start position:0%
and directs it and so on but law itself
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
is things that that change and and we
 
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
change it all the time and we add and we
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
subtract and so on so so that particular
 
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.430 align:start position:0%
subtract and so on so so that particular
argument

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.150 align:start position:0%
argument
um

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sway me now to the specifics
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill so one thing that I didn't
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
realize until recently is this is paying
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
specifically for teachers and group two
 
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
members and for some reason
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
um others uh other employees clerks and
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
and so on are are not included and I'm
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
not quite sure the the rationale for
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
that but it's it's just sort of
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
interesting but in general this bill
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
so the way to cut tax this bill is is
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
sort of labeled I guess the the
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
um uh Property Tax Relief act of 2023.
 
00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:08.269 align:start position:0%
um uh Property Tax Relief act of 2023.
so

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
but the real way to relieve property
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
taxes is to lower spending right that's
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
what we do in this committee all the
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
time if we want to lower taxes we have
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
to lower spending what this bill does is
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
it shifts money from one group of
 
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to another
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
right and it it does it in a way that
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
encourages spending not discourages
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
spending so in a sense this bill
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
um raises taxes right but if you have
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
more spending you've got to have more
 
00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:45.019 align:start position:0%
taxes because they have to be in balance
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so by encouraging spending because
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it says to
 
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities we'll take if you spend X
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll kick in something right if
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
you don't spend we don't kick you right
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
so it's a discount sort of on on this
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
kind of spending and what that does is
 
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
make people spend more on that right and
 
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.009 align:start position:0%
make people spend more on that right and
so

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
um if you really wanted to Simply Cut
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
Property Tax the easy way to do it would
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
be to reduce Sweat Right what we did
 
00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
last time two year you know in the last
 
00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:26.579 align:start position:0%
budget there was a hundred million
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
dollars cut from swept that goes
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
directly into property tax bills 100
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars less this one is a 50
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
million dollar item over the budget so
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
it's half of that
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
um and it but it but it directs you know
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
now we get into the spreadsheet politics
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
but it it essentially is subsidizing
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
cities at the expense of smaller
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
communities right because cities tend to
 
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
have more spending on
 
00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.790 align:start position:0%
have more spending on
um

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
on teachers and fire and police compared
 
00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
to lower other communities I did a
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
little example of
 
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
um here where I compared conquered with
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
my town of Epsom okay so in this bill
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
Concord receives 15 times what my town
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
of Epsom would receive
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
but their population is only nine times
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
bigger you see and they're and their
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
property valuation if we were talking
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
about property is also nine times bigger
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
so so our my town has one-ninth the
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
population one-ninth the property value
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
of Concord but according to this bill
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
this bill would direct funds 15 times to
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
conquer compared to my town so so so
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
this is essentially
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
a transfer of wealth from from towns
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
like mine to cities okay now
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
I would be willing may I sorry I'm just
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
going to interrupt you a minute the
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
clerk isn't here and there are no roll
 
00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
call sheets here so I'm going to
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
disappear while you continue all right
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
all right well that's going to make me
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
talk longer rather I was about to sort
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
so where were we so
 
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
so where were we so
um

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is a transfer in that way
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
now compromise so I am willing to
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
compromise in a way that actually does
 
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
benefit cities in the same way as this
 
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.500 align:start position:0%
bill or very close to it
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
by spending this 50 million dollars
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
it putting it into the unfunded
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
liability of the retirement system
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
right so because the the way the
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability of the retirement
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
system is being paid off is
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
um it's based on current employment so
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
effectively cities are paying more
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
because they have a lot more employees
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
than than municipalities rather than you
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
know paying it off by population or
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
property value if you see what I mean so
 
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
if we pay down the unfunded liability of
 
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
the retirement system faster it would
 
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.509 align:start position:0%
the retirement system faster it would
benefit

00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities and especially cities in
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
the same way that this bill does not
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
quite identical because this bill is
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
directed specifically at teachers police
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
and fire whereas the whole unfunded
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
liability includes others uh other
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
categories and County employees and so
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
on right but
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
um that spice yes but I would think that
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
that is a better way of of spending
 
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
money than this bill because this bill
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
gives money directly this year but
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
paying down the unfunded liability is
 
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
paying down debt that's long term so it
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the problem of of the
 
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:16.860 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of of of
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
um encouraging spending
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
right if the unfunded liability is is a
 
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
little less or a little more that
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter you know spending is
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
still is is is is not affected but it
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
does benefit those towns because in the
 
00:15:33.129 --> 00:15:33.139 align:start position:0%
long run
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
their expenses will go down
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
significantly and the reason is when we
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
give money to unfunded liability
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
this if we give them a dollar this year
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's a dollar seven they don't have to
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
pay next year or a dollar fourteen they
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the year after that or
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
a dollar 21 they don't have to pay the
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
year after that do you see what I mean
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
because because of the assumed rate of
 
00:15:59.569 --> 00:15:59.579 align:start position:0%
growth of the of the retirement system
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be a great
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
compromise right pay down the unfunded
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
liability it would benefit cities in
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
exactly the same way this bill does but
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
not in a way that encourages them to
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
spend thank you Mr chairman
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
further comments representative Griffin
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
I also took my town and compared it to a
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
city and came up pretty much with the
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
same results
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
bound on when he did it and basically
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
this bill has the small particularly
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
evident in class two employees it has a
 
00:16:43.079 --> 00:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
evident in class two employees it has a
small

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
towns the medium-sized sounds funding
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
the large cities which doesn't seem to
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
so I think the compromise that was off
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
it is is a is a very good one where
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
either we pay down the swept
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
or we pay the unfunded liability of the
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
pension rather than
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
rather than benefit one group over a
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
further comments
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the role
 
00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:23.459 align:start position:0%
I'm the clerk apparently so
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire
 
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.049 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire
aye

00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
and this is on the motion of itl
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kim brills is absent
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative hatch is absent
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt oh
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I will vote no motion fails it is
 
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.770 align:start position:0%
and I will vote no motion fails it is
tied

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
so that leaves us in is there a motion
 
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
so that leaves us in is there a motion
that

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
one two three one two three right
 
00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
one two three one two three right
okay

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
so just look at your check marks they're
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
not quite no I'll correct it I was just
 
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
making noises I went around yeah
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
but I know what the vote is okay
 
00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.210 align:start position:0%
but I know what the vote is okay
um

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
so I miss you said you had other ideas
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire as far as putting
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
it maybe the 24 25 million that the Bill
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
calls for towards the unfunded liability
 
00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
or did I catch that correctly yes and um
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
if you want me to prepare that as an
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd be happy to do so
 
00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:48.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
I would
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
propose an alternative concept and that
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
is that we fund at 7.5 percent for the
 
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.850 align:start position:0%
is that we fund at 7.5 percent for the
biennium

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
all right is that seconded
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt second staff
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
is there a discussion on representative
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
ebel's motion representative Griffin
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a question isn't that
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
what the bill does it's it continues it
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
for basically ever unless we modify it
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah it's no problem
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments on
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative Evil's motion to limit it
 
00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
to the session
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
to the term the term yeah right
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
um could I just make one other comment
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
um if if the representative from the
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
municipal Association has anything to
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
say if or to correct me but as I
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
understood her testimony during the
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearing she said that the payment that
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
we made to the municipalities last year
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
was extremely helpful for that to them
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they would appreciate a
 
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure they would appreciate a
similar

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
well there's a motion on the floor so we
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
won't take any comments unfortunately
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
from those in attendance
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
it's been seconded by representative
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
Hewitt again to make it clear what the
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
motion is is to limit the 7.5 payout for
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
this legislative term
 
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:31.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a quick question sure so if we
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
voted yes to this is it like voting yes
 
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
to the amendment but not to the bill
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct okay the
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill is amended yep I mean if I vote Yes
 
00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
are we going to say off the pass with
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is our recommendation to the
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee or is this amendment a
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then we vote
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
separately and not the best the bill is
 
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.470 align:start position:0%
separately and not the best the bill is
amended

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.169 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's representative hatch so
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
all right so we clear it's the
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative evils motion to amend the
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
bill that we have before us to limit the
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
payout of 7.5 to the session so it'll be
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
a two-year payout versus continuing
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
right okay on the motion offered by
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel seconded by Hewitt
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
of amending the bill as stated earlier
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin no
 
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:48.740 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney no
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
Campbell's absent patches absent
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.010 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry yes
 
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:02.409 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry yes
[Laughter]

00:22:02.409 --> 00:22:02.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
representative evil
yes

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
and I will vote Yes emotion fails as it
 
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative why don't we go back
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:21.059 align:start position:0%
the vice chairs motion that
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment be prepared to put the
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
money into
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability all right you have a
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
want to use the same specific dollar
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
amount that the Bill calls for
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I I propose just
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
an even 25 million
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
or 50 million for the whole budget term
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
so right now the appropriation being
 
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:48.500 align:start position:0%
requested is 26.49 million and
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
27.13 so you're looking at a flat 25
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
I would actually prefer it to be 50
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
million in the first year at nothing in
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
the second year just because of the the
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
advantages of doing that
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right would you like to speak
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
further to your motion
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
I'll answer questions but I don't know
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the motion's been made and seconded
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
and now it's open for discussion
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
representative Eva I'm sorry Mr chair I
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
really wanted to hear from the municipal
 
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
really wanted to hear from the municipal
Association

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
um but now we have a motion so we can't
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
unless we turn down this motion that we
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
I especially like representative
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
McGuire's motion I would like to hear
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
what the municipal Association has to
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
weigh in on and I know this will be
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
substantial I think we heard from Marty
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
last week that something in the
 
00:23:57.049 --> 00:23:57.059 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of I think he used the
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
example of 50 million dollars could
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
reduce and he'll correct me I'll let him
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
that it might reduce the contributions
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
made to or by the towns towards the
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability by as much as four
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
percent is that roughly correct
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
hopefully the year total
 
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.260 align:start position:0%
puts it in between
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
1.01.1.2 percent of a which represents
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
about 4 million a year for a 15 million
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation so that again that
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
and that would be this permanent
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
reduction that we haven't found over
 
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.190 align:start position:0%
reduction that we haven't found over
time

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.409 align:start position:0%
 
Maybe

00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
all right I guess see we are
 
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
since a motion's been made and obviously
 
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
the numbers would have swung if I'd
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
allow representative Hajj perhaps in but
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
I will keep it the way it is in fairness
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:03.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:03.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure I'm sure you could
 
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.789 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure I'm sure you could
understand

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
so just so we're clear we've already had
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
like three or four motions
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative hatch I think I'm almost
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative evil well representative
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hedges I just wanted to clarify
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
something that you said if this motion
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
fails then we could
 
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:25.460 align:start position:0%
um hear from the municipal Association
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'll stretch it out I've been known to
 
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:36.740 align:start position:0%
be a little lenient here
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to come forward this is
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
like not customary for us but obviously
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving Parts it's a lot
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
of money it has could have some great
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
benefits to the municipalities have
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
passed in my view but
 
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.250 align:start position:0%
passed in my view but
um

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
Mrs heck well thank you for allowing me
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
to come for the record my name is
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
Catherine heck and I represent the New
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association the 234
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in New Hampshire
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if I should take
 
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
questions or comment
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
I would comment on that bill so the
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
previous bill that was passed House Bill
 
00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:15.539 align:start position:0%
1221 provided a one-time payment and
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent to cities and
 
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:21.860 align:start position:0%
towns that was reported on the ms-4
 
00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
so that reduced taxation because it was
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
reported as Revenue so that
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
when we tax rate was set the revenues
 
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
right minus exemptions and credits and
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
then you total the Appropriations so
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the tax rate was reduced
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
because we received more Revenue than we
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
anticipated the bill before us today is
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
structured a little bit differently it's
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
a permanent restoration of the promise
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
that was made back in 1967 when we all
 
00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
joined and we all know the history there
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
group one there was a question group one
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
employees were never part of that system
 
00:28:00.649 --> 00:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
and they're not compulsory members of
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
that system and that is why it's only
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
group one teachers police and fire
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
because in the original system group one
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
employees such as Highway perhaps or
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
town office staff was not part of that
 
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
original system to representative
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
McGuire's query on that so that is why
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
we don't see that moving forward because
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
that wasn't part of the original
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
promise that was made to municipalities
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill moving forward has towns
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
budgeting 92.5 percent in the state
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
paying the retirement system seven and a
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
half percent so what that means when we
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
raise and appropriate money what we're
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
asking for we don't need to report it as
 
00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
Revenue because we're asking for Less in
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
our budget that we bring forth to the
 
00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
voter so it's automatically reducing the
 
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
line so that's also another form of
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
property tax relief anytime
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities receive monies from the
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
state that don't have to be raised
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
locally that is a property tax reduction
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
so that connection on either side can be
 
00:28:59.450 --> 00:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
made but this bill moving forward would
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
reduce Appropriations so what the town
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
is authorizing the governing body to
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
spend would be less by seven and a half
 
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.169 align:start position:0%
spend would be less by seven and a half
percent

00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it's extremely helpful in either case
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
our cities and towns saw tremendous
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
relief from that with fuel oil prices
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
and inflation on that one-time payment
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
really did make a difference this year
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
whether it was a small town or a large
 
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
city all budgets are to scale so to
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
speak so we did appreciate that payment
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
and we are advocating for the seven and
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
a half percent even though of course our
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
member policy is for the restoration of
 
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for that
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
um seeing no further questions I'll ask
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative yay
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative Kim Rhodes
 
00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.289 align:start position:0%
representative Kim Rhodes
absent

00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not voting I wasn't here for the
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.350 align:start position:0%
 
aye

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
well being six to zero motion passes
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay is a clerk state of the motion
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
passes uh why are you laughing
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt said something
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
okay all right well thanks everybody I
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
think it was a good debate and in the
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
end municipalities will be getting some
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
relief and
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
um 50 million dollars towards the
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability will move forward
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
with a positive recommendation to the
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative I just have a question
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
when do we see the Amendment language
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
they will draft that in the next day or
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
two of the LBA and OLS
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman represent Maguire
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that OLS will consider
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
this or or the clerk or whoever uh
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
Germaine so because it actually I mean
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
it it moves sort of the section we're
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
talking about and that sort of stuff
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'll hear one way or the other
 
00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:43.130 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'll hear one way or the other
thanks

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:45.140 align:start position:0%
we're a little
 
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
ahead here so I think we've got about a
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
half an hour which we can break before
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.680 --> 01:02:44.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.529 --> 01:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
all right uh being 11 o'clock or a few
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
minutes thereafter like to rep recognize
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General for the State of
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and appreciate your
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
attendance here today absolutely thank

you Mr chair
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
um good morning members of the committee
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
I'm John fermella attorney general happy
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
to be here the chair asked me to come
 
01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
today just to do an overview
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
presentation of the Department of
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
Justice and my understanding is you've
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
been getting those presentations for
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
from other agencies as well so to help
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
guide the discussion I I brought a
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
couple of handouts which you should have
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
in front of you one is an organizational
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
chart for the Attorney General's office
 
01:08:45.289 --> 01:08:45.299 align:start position:0%
and the other is just a short PowerPoint
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to run through that
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
mostly tracks the organizational chart
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
but just kind of guides a discussion of
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
an overview of the office you'll notice
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
in the top right hand corner I have a
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
disclaimer on the org chart we're in the
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
process of revamping our org chart right
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
now because we've had some some people
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
shift around we've had a couple of
 
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
additions so this is basically how the
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
office looks but it's not the official
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
org chart at this moment in time so I
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
just wanted to as a lawyer we like
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
disclaimers I put the put the disclaimer
 
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
up there on the top right you'll also
 
01:09:19.249 --> 01:09:19.259 align:start position:0%
notice that below
 
01:09:19.259 --> 01:09:20.030 align:start position:0%
notice that below
um

01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:21.769 --> 01:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
the bottom half of the organ chart I
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
took names off of some of these units
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's because again we've had some
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
people move around and rather than try
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
to make sure everything was absolutely
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
accurate I just took the names off for
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
now because I think for your purposes
 
01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:35.540 align:start position:0%
it's more important that you understand
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
the various units and the functions as
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to what individuals are running
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
any given unit at this point in time
 
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.950 align:start position:0%
any given unit at this point in time
so

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
I think the best way to to start off
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about the Department of Justice
 
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
is thinking about the roles and
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the Attorney General
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
because the Department of Justice is is
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
a somewhat unique agency in state
 
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
government and that it really is built
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
around roles and responsibilities that
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
are given to the AG and then the AG
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
delegates those functions out throughout
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
so on the second slide
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
you have I just have have a list of what
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
we think of as sort of the five jobs of
 
01:10:21.169 --> 01:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
the first and probably the the best
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
known is to be the chief law enforcement
 
01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:28.820 align:start position:0%
officer for the state so the AG uh over
 
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
overseas in in a in a somewhat loose
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
sense all of the law enforcement
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the state that doesn't mean
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
other state and local law enforcement
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
agencies don't operate independently but
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
in certain instances when enforcing the
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
criminal laws of the state the AG can
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
decide to exercise control over any law
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency depending on
 
01:10:51.649 --> 01:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
depending on the needs of a particular
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
case or a particular situation so chief
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers is kind of the
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
the first job I think that people think
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
of when they think of the AG the second
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
job and it's closely related is Chief
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so the legislature has
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
decided to also give the AG the job of
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
overseeing all of the prosecutors
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys local prosecutors again that
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that prosecutors throughout
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state don't operate independently
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
because they do but
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I think it is important and we've
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
seen it work well it's important for
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
there to be someone at the top kind of
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
giving a general giving General guidance
 
01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
general direction General strategy
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
training to to all of the prosecutors in
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
the state and that's what the Attorney
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
General's office does we meet with the
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
County attorneys every other month so I
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
and and my team meet with all 10 County
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
attorneys every other month and we talk
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
about what's going on around the state
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
what prosecutors are facing what the
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
needs are where we might need more
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
resources where we could be be doing
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
things differently and I think it's a
 
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.250 align:start position:0%
things differently and I think it's a
really

01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
um it's a really good setup because the
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
County attorneys again they run their
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
offices independently but I think having
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
sort of that team approach in this state
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
works really well not every state is
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
and then the AG is the chief legal
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
officer for the state and basically what
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
that means is the attorney general is is
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
the lawyer for state government and all
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
three branches of government some people
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
don't realize that we actually represent
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch in addition to the
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
executive branch and the legislature if
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
a judge gets sued for something an
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
individual judge if the judicial branch
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
gets sued say an employment
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination claim it's the Department
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
of Justice that represents the judicial
 
01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:40.340 align:start position:0%
branch so that uh that is an interesting
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
exercise in making sure that we protect
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
against conflicts of interest as you can
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
imagine because if we are representing
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
an individual judge who might have been
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
sued for something we have to make sure
 
01:12:52.610 --> 01:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
the lawyer doing that is not also
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
appearing in front of that judge in
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
their courtroom so we we take a lot of
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
steps to to handle conflicts and that's
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
a theme that comes up over and over
 
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
again in the Department of Justice it's
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
something we talk about a lot something
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
people ask questions about often but I
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
think the office has a very good
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
tradition of figuring out how to handle
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
that we put up walls when we need to put
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
up walls I think we handle conflicts
 
01:13:16.199 --> 01:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
up walls I think we handle conflicts
well

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
the fourth sort of primary job of the
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the Attorney General's
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
office is public protection and this is
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
public protection in a broader sense
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
than just law enforcement
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
and a good example of the public
 
01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:33.860 align:start position:0%
protection function is when
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and the Department
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
of Justice bring a lawsuit on behalf of
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
not any one individual not on behalf of
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
state government or a state agency but
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the people of the state and
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
there are a number of examples of that
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in recent years one are
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
the opioid cases that the office has
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
brought against manufacturers pharmacies
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
Distributors to hold them accountable
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
for for contributing to the opioid
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:14:04.729 --> 01:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
another example are the environmental
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
cases so the drinking and groundwater
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
trust fund is a fund that was
 
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
capitalized with monies that were
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
obtained from lawsuits the Attorney
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
General's office brought against Exxon
 
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
Mobil and other companies that pollute
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
that had polluted our groundwater the
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit we brought against the state
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts for taxing remote
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
workers that was brought again on behalf
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
of the people of the state generally so
 
01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.649 align:start position:0%
of the people of the state generally so
that's

01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
public protection and public interest
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the the Attorney General's office is I
 
01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day kind of the
 
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
the backstop for that in the state so
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's the fourth important job of the
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General and then the fifth job
 
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:47.580 align:start position:0%
is to run the Department of Justice so
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
that you know that the Attorney General
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
in addition to everything else is a
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner and an agency head just
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
like all the other agency heads that's
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
ultimately accountable to the governor
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
and Council to the legislature just like
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
the next slide is kind of related to
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
that slide but another when you're
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
thinking about the Department of Justice
 
01:15:08.810 --> 01:15:08.820 align:start position:0%
I think it's also important to think
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
about who does the attorney general who
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
does the doj represent
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
and there are really two answers to that
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
that uh depend upon the context
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
in some contexts in one part one part of
 
01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
our function is to represent the state
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and by the state I mean state government
 
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
so again all three branches of
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
government individual state employees
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
when they're acting within their
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
official functions that includes
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
legislators that includes legislative
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
leadership that includes state agencies
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
executive branch Branch agencies from
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
Commissioners all the way down again it
 
01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
includes the judicial branch so we
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
represent pretty much all state
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
employees and All State agencies when
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
acting within the scope of their
 
01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
acting within the scope of their
employment

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:15:56.689 --> 01:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
we also represent
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I hit that on the next slide
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
we also represent the public
 
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
the reason the distinction between these
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
two is important is because when the
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is sort of sitting in
 
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
the function of the government's lawyer
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
and representing state government and
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
representing the legislature we are
 
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
we are an attorney serving our client we
 
01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
are accountable directly to our clients
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature the governor the
 
01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
01:16:29.570 --> 01:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
when the office is representing the
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
public so Prosecuting crimes working
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement
 
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.510 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement
um

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:37.940 align:start position:0%
overseeing and registering Charities
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
bringing consumer protection actions
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
enforcing the state's election laws the
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
office really operates more
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
independently it's accountable to to the
 
01:16:49.729 --> 01:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
public and not as directly accountable
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
to the governor or the legislature in
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
any specific incidents of course the
 
01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislature can also always change the
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
laws and give give the AG's office new
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
jobs or take away Authority the
 
01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
legislature can make appropriation
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
decisions so give us money to do one
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
thing and not another thing but when we
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
are say investigating a homicide and
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
deciding whether or not to prosecute we
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
make those decisions independently we've
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
we've been delegated that Authority and
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the way it works in all
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
in all states and those specific
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
instances we the AG ultimately has to
 
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
make that decision on his or her own and
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
I think the reason for that is to keep
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
decisions like that that shouldn't be
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
political or shouldn't get tied up in
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
the various policy debates of the day to
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
keep keep those functions independent
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
from from those wins on a day-to-day
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
basis again that doesn't mean the office
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't still have accounted isn't still
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
accountable but it's accountable in a
 
01:17:50.689 --> 01:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
broader sense to the legislature and the
 
01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.010 align:start position:0%
broader sense to the legislature and the
governor

01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
so those are kind of just some general
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
General ways I think about the office I
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
think about the office that way in large
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
part based on
 
01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:03.910 align:start position:0%
part based on
um

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
how AGS throughout the years have
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
thought about the office how the
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
legislature throughout the years has
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
treated the office how the governor's
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
office has treated the office and how
 
01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
courts have generally opined on on the
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
offices function in the office's role so
 
01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:20.659 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of in a broad sense
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
is good context for the various
 
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
functions I'm going to talk through
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
um the next slide which was sort of
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
client service versus independent
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
obligations basically that's that's what
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
I just talked about so in one sense
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
we're serving a client in another sense
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
we have sort of independent obligations
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
to enforce the law and ensure compliance
 
01:18:52.669 --> 01:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
the rest of this PowerPoint basically
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
gets to the specifics of what I think I
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
was asked to talk about today which is
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
just an overview of the structure of the
 
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:02.090 align:start position:0%
just an overview of the structure of the
office

01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
the PowerPoint roughly tracks the
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
organizational chart I'm basically going
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
to go kind of from left to right on the
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
org chart so whatever is useful to you I
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
think you can reference but when you
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
at the top
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
obviously you've got the senior
 
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
leadership of the office you've got the
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the deputy attorney
 
01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:28.739 align:start position:0%
general and the chief of staff and then
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
we also have a director of
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
communications and a director of
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
administration that kind of makes up the
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
what we call the front office in the
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office so essentially
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
the the senior leadership of the office
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
that that work with all parts of the
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
office and not just one specific
 
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.689 align:start position:0%
office and not just one specific
function

01:19:47.689 --> 01:19:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:50.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
McGuire has a question sure yeah thank
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for coming
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't see a whole lot of numbers in
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
here which is kind of our purview when
 
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the org chart can
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
you kind of say how what's the head
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
count under each group or you know
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
approximately because that's kind of
 
01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
where we what we think about yep
 
01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I could certainly provide
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
you I can provide I have we have a
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
presentation that's more detailed which
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
of course we would plan to give you once
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're presenting our budget but I can
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
give you a rough sense of it today we
 
01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:27.480 align:start position:0%
have about 160 to 170 employees total in
 
01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
roughly 80 to 90 of those positions are
 
01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.669 align:start position:0%
roughly 80 to 90 of those positions are
lawyers

01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
and the rest of those positions are
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
non-lawyer personnel
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
and as we go through the various areas
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
of the office I can give you a rough
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
head count and I will have of course
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
those exact numbers for you once we've
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
got got our our budget once your but our
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
budget is in front of you and we're
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
the first part of the office is the
 
01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:02.219 align:start position:0%
division of public protection
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
and that is kind of exactly how it
 
01:21:07.610 --> 01:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
sounds and it is the part of the office
 
01:21:10.970 --> 01:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
that really focuses on on law
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
enforcement so it has the criminal
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
justice Bureau it has the consumer
 
01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:16.739 align:start position:0%
protection antitrust Bureau and it has
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau kind
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
of falls into both camps really it
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
there's a law enforcement component to
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
that and there's also a client
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
counseling component to that but you'll
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
see that throughout the Department of
 
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.910 align:start position:0%
see that throughout the Department of
Justice

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.810 align:start position:0%
Justice
um

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:36.189 --> 01:21:36.199 align:start position:0%
given the nature of what we do
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
some functions of the office don't fall
 
01:21:42.350 --> 01:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
neatly into one camp or the other some
 
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:44.219 align:start position:0%
functions do both civil and criminal
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
work some functions do both client
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
counseling and public Protection work
 
01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.850 align:start position:0%
counseling and public Protection work
some

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:51.780 align:start position:0%
functions do litigation and
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
non-litigation work you know that
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're they're just by nature is is a
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
mix in a lot of these different
 
01:21:59.930 --> 01:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
functions but in a rough sense the
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
division of public protection is mostly
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecution and law enforcement
 
01:22:06.169 --> 01:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
type functions
 
01:22:08.209 --> 01:22:08.219 align:start position:0%
the division of legal counsel is the
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
other side of the office and that that
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
does civil litigation
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
civil client counseling for the state
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
that has the charitable trust unit which
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
registers and oversees charities in the
 
01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:23.300 align:start position:0%
state that has the debt Recovery Unit
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
which seeks to recover debts that are
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
owed to the state that can be any type
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
of debt from unpaid taxes to
 
01:22:32.159 --> 01:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
of debt from unpaid taxes to
um

01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
unfulfilled contract obligations that an
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
agency might have had with a vendor it
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
really can cover anything and it's
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
really up to State agencies throughout
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the state to refer things to the debt
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
Recovery Unit
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
the division of legal counsel has the
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
election law unit this is another part
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
of the office that's unique and that it
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
does civil and criminal work if someone
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
sues the state challenging one of the
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
state's election laws then the election
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
law unit defends that statute if someone
 
01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:02.699 align:start position:0%
violates the state selection laws the
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
election law unit prosecutes that person
 
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:06.540 align:start position:0%
for violating the state's election laws
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
so it's another part of the office that
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
does kind of both criminal and civil
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
functions and then the Civil Rights unit
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
is also in the division of legal counsel
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
so that's a high level vision of the two
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
we also have a moving
 
01:23:29.689 --> 01:23:29.699 align:start position:0%
over to the far right the office of
 
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
solicitor general
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
that handles all appeals within the
 
01:23:33.719 --> 01:23:34.930 align:start position:0%
that handles all appeals within the
office

01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:34.940 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
it does Criminal and Civil Appeals and
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
it kind of helps guide legal strategy
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
after that we have the office of the
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner
 
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons the org chart is in
 
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
draft form is because right now it shows
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the chief medical examiner
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
within division of within the division
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
of public protection it's really not
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
within that division it's its own
 
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
independent entity and it needs to be
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
because the courts need to be able to
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
rely on the feedback of the medical
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
examiner when they're asked to conduct
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
an autopsy opine on a cause of death
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
that really they need to be doing that
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
analysis and answering those questions
 
01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
independently they're not a tool of the
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
prosecution they're their own their own
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
independent independent actor
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
and then the office has a director of
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
administration which
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
does kind of Base it pretty much does
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
the basic business functions of the
 
01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:37.130 align:start position:0%
the basic business functions of the
office

01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
under the director of minute of
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
administration is a director of Law
 
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
Office infrastructure
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
who kind of handles the technology needs
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
and basic infrastructure needs of the
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
office we have a business office that's
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
under the director of administration the
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
business office uh
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
performs accounting functions and basic
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
payroll functions there's a victims
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
compensation unit in that part of the
 
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
office the victim's compensation unit
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
oversees the state's victims
 
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program
 
01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
state has a program in which victims of
 
01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
crime can apply to receive I think it's
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
up to fifty thousand dollars to help
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
with any costs or expenses that they
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
might incur because of the fact that
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
they're a victim of a crime
 
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
and then that part of the office also
 
01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:27.140 align:start position:0%
has the grants management unit and
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives we have kind of a
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
grants management and strategic
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
initiatives unit that goes out and seeks
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
grants that might be available for
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
various law enforcement functions
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
whether it's from the federal government
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
or other parties and we often sub-grant
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
those funds out to to other agencies in
 
01:25:47.689 --> 01:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
state government local law enforcement
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
agencies or private organizations in in
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
some instances
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
I recognize I am going kind of fast
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
because there is a lot to talk about
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
with the office but I will
 
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to now get a little bit more
 
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
into the weeds and here I'm going to
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
give you some rough numbers and head
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
counts I'm going to start on the left
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
of the org chart in the division of
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
public protection go through each Bureau
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
and unit just to give you a sense of how
 
01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
many people are in each one but happy to
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
um I just wondered if you could explain
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
like within each state agency they also
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
have legal counsel
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
so what's the interface with the AG's
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
office yeah that's a great question so
 
01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.669 align:start position:0%
office yeah that's a great question so
we

01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
some agencies have their own in-house
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers and in the AG's office we have
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
what we call a client counseling unit so
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
our client counseling unit works and
 
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
serves every state agency and state
 
01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.410 align:start position:0%
serves every state agency and state
government

01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
and for agencies that have in-house
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
attorneys our client counseling unit
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
Works directly with those attorneys on
 
01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:03.380 align:start position:0%
the legal needs of those agencies
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
typically we handle the Overflow so if
 
01:27:08.090 --> 01:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
there's something
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
that an agency is was working on that is
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
too big for their in-house lawyers to
 
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
handle we will provide additional
 
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
support we also provide legal advice to
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
those in-house lawyers so on on
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
complicated questions of law where they
 
01:27:24.709 --> 01:27:24.719 align:start position:0%
feel like they they can't answer it
 
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
themselves they reach out to us and we
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
interface with them we also proactively
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
reach out to those lawyers because part
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
of our job is to make sure that all
 
01:27:35.689 --> 01:27:35.699 align:start position:0%
agencies are complying with the law and
 
01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
not doing anything that they're not
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing and making sure
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
that they're doing this the jobs that
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
the legislature has given them right
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're not missing something so that
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's kind of how that interface goes
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a good collaboration but
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's also sort of a form of
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
supervision because I think
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
the way the office has always viewed
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
that relationship is that because the
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is the chief legal
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
officer we have a responsibility both to
 
01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.610 align:start position:0%
officer we have a responsibility both to
assist

01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
assist
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
lawyers and agencies but also ensure
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
that they're they're getting to the
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
right legal answers and my experience
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
has been that eight lawyers and agencies
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
want that type of collaboration they're
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
not looking to sort of go Rogue so to
 
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
speak they're just looking to do their
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
jobs well but that that's kind of how we
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
so I know like with doit they have
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
embeds in different agencies and then
 
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
they charge those agencies for their do
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
you charge the agencies for your
 
01:28:43.010 --> 01:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
services yeah there's a couple there's a
 
01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
couple different ways we quote charge
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
for our services one and I'm gonna be
 
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
honest I am not very well versed in the
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
whole Das is better at this but there's
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's a whole mechanism by which
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and I forget what it's called but for
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
for services that are provided Statewide
 
01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
all agencies sort of pay pay a rough
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
share of those and legal services is one
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
of those categories so every agency is
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
kind of paying their share for Legal
 
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:13.370 align:start position:0%
kind of paying their share for Legal
Services

01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
what was that
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's that's one way we we
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
charge agencies another way we charge
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
agencies is we do have some particular
 
01:29:28.209 --> 01:29:28.219 align:start position:0%
agencies that have unique legal needs
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
and in that sense those agencies will
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
pay for a lawyer within the Department
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
of Justice to be get dedicated
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
specifically to them the puc is a great
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
example we have a lawyer that the puc
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
pays for and that lawyer is dedicated
 
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
specifically to working with the puc
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
because the puc is kind of a niche area
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they have very unique legal needs so
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
those are kind of the two ways we charge
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
so now I'm going to get into
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
get into the meat of this with the time
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
the first Bureau I'm going to talk about
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
is within the within the division of
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
public protection and it is the largest
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau in the office so it's probably
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
the bureau that warrants the most
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and it's the criminal justice
 
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.090 align:start position:0%
discussion and it's the criminal justice
Bureau

01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
so the criminal justice Bureau had again
 
01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's the largest Bureau in the office it
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
has roughly 30 to 35 attorneys in it
 
01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:30.590 align:start position:0%
has roughly 30 to 35 attorneys in it
so

01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
just in one Bureau you have roughly 40
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
percent of the lawyers in the office but
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
given the office's core law enforcement
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
function it makes sense
 
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
there are multiple units within the
 
01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Bureau the biggest unit
 
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
is the homicide unit
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
the homicide unit has probably six to
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
seven lawyers that are specifically
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
dedicated to two homicides
 
01:30:59.870 --> 01:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
but every attorney within the criminal
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
justice Bureau just about
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
catches a homicide case from time to
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
time we do that just to sort of spread
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that work out and get everybody
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
experience doing homicide cases because
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
homicide cases are our biggest and
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
highest profile
 
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
and at least on the criminal side are
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
most important cases
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
chairman how many homicides are there in
 
01:31:28.729 --> 01:31:28.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a year and how many become
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
charged I mean how many is there a case
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
as far as a percentage of what you know
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
how many cases do we solve and bring
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
charges for in the normal course I don't
 
01:31:46.679 --> 01:31:48.050 align:start position:0%
charges for in the normal course I don't
have

01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
an exact percentage for you I mean the
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
vast majority we we identify the
 
01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
perpetrator pretty quickly and we bring
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
charges pretty quickly I could go back
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
and try to figure out what that
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
percentage looks like I don't have an
 
01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:02.820 align:start position:0%
exact percentage for you but
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
I think we have a total
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know we have a total of uh
 
01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the range of 120 130 cold
 
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
cases from you know from from all time
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
so to speak so
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
you know given that that's the total
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
number of cold cases and we have average
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
roughly 18 to 19 per year we solve the
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the cases but I can go
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
back certainly it's a good question get
 
01:32:30.250 --> 01:32:30.260 align:start position:0%
a percentage for you a rough percentage
 
01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
so so a a homicide case takes up a half
 
01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
a year of an attorney's time is that
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
roughly how it works
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
because you said let's say you had 15
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
cases you have seven attorneys right
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
that something like that yeah yep so uh
 
01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
one homicide case
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
the facts and circumstances can take up
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of time but homicide lawyers don't
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
they they focus on homicides if they
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
have additional capacity we'll give them
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
other we'll give them other cases but it
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
really depends but I can tell you
 
01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.790 align:start position:0%
really depends but I can tell you
um

01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:12.649 --> 01:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
one thing that happens with homicide
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
cases is homicide layers have to be on
 
01:33:16.729 --> 01:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
call right so they all they split up on
 
01:33:19.550 --> 01:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
Call shifts but 24 7.
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
every minute of every day we have to
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
have a homicide team on call because a
 
01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
homicide can happen anytime
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
um once a homicide does happen
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
the lawyers work probably 24 7 for a few
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
days to do the initial investigation get
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
a sense of what happened go to the scene
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
secure the scene
 
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.890 align:start position:0%
secure the scene
um

01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
do that initial work and then if the
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
case is complicated if it's not obvious
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of investigative work that
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
I would say on average I I wouldn't
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily say a homicide case takes up
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
like six months of time necessarily but
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
it it can if it's very complicated it
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
may not take up as much time if
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
everything's on video when you get a
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
confession right away right and the
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
person pleads guilty uh trials
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
another thing that's important to
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
remember is that you know a homicide
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
happens in say the year 2020
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of investigative work
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of prep the trial for that
 
01:34:28.970 --> 01:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
case isn't really happening until 2022.
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
so if you're a homicide attorney you
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
have at any given time
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
you're on call so you could catch a new
 
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
case anytime you're prepping cases for
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
trial that have happened in past years
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
you're working on the appeal for cases
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
that are already over where you've
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
gotten a conviction but the person has
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
appealed and you it's or you're working
 
01:34:51.169 --> 01:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
on a habeas corpus petition which can
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
come even after an appeal is resolved so
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of a rolling a a rolling
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
wave of work in the homicide world just
 
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
like it is in any criminal case but
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
homicide and homicides in particular
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
because they're so complicated in many
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
instances and they they go on for a long
 
01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
time and the work comes in waves and
 
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's not always predictable when the
 
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
work is going to come you might get a
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
break in the case and that creates a
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
bunch of work so anyway that's a long
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
way of answering your question yeah
 
01:35:25.129 --> 01:35:25.139 align:start position:0%
while we're on homicides am I just
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
paying more attention to television or
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
homicides ticking upwards in the state
 
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
so we average 18 to 19 per year we I
 
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
think we had 29 last year so last year
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
we were above average we had a big year
 
01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:42.980 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we had 33.
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
so in a couple of recent years we've had
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
above average years and what that does
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
is it creates a lot of work in that year
 
01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
but because of what what I just
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
described it also creates a lot of work
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
in the years that follow because those
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
cases are starting to go to trial right
 
01:36:01.729 --> 01:36:01.739 align:start position:0%
they're they're starting to heat up and
 
01:36:01.739 --> 01:36:02.810 align:start position:0%
they're they're starting to heat up and
so

01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
the homicide lawyers they're not just
 
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
working on the cases that happened
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
yesterday they're working on they're
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
working on getting ready for trial on
 
01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
the next unit we've got is the the drug
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
unit the drug unit has four
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
full-time attorneys in it so the drug
 
01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:25.610 align:start position:0%
full-time attorneys in it so the drug
unit

01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:25.620 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
basically does our most
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
our most complicated drug prosecutions
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
in the state all of the County attorneys
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
also do drug cases so we do not have
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
exclusive jurisdiction over drug cases
 
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
the way we do over homicides but we tend
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
to take on the more complicated the more
 
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.610 --> 01:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
my question the County Attorney do they
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
always start with the drug cases or is
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
it sometimes automatic to State Attorney
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
General's office handles that or is it
 
01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
they turn it over to you or how does
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
that work so we it depends most most of
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
our drug cases originate with us and
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
that's because we have the Attorney
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
General's drug task force the Attorney
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
General's drug task force which I I was
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
going to get to it's also part of the
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
criminal Bureau that is made up of
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
officers from local law enforcement
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
agencies around the state those agencies
 
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
will send their officers for two or
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
three years to our drug task force and
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we use to investigate more
 
01:37:34.490 --> 01:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
complicated drug cases or if we become
 
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
aware of an operation or a drug ring
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we decide to investigate we'll use
 
01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
the drug task force and that's kind of
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
how we originate our more complicated
 
01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
drug cases the County attorneys don't do
 
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
as much of those types of cases they
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
they do some of them they do some
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
complicated cases but they do a lot more
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
of the smaller stuff that doesn't
 
01:37:59.810 --> 01:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:03.649 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
the next part of the office and I'm I'm
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
using the slides just for reference so
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm going a little bit out of the order
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
of what's on the org chart but I think
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough to to find each of
 
01:38:16.850 --> 01:38:16.860 align:start position:0%
these units there but the next part of
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
the office is the Medicaid fraud control
 
01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.149 align:start position:0%
the office is the Medicaid fraud control
unit

01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
that unit has three lawyers and that
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
that unit's job is basically to
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
prosecute Medicaid fraud so that unit
 
01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
gets mostly gets referrals from the
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
because if they see something that looks
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
off they'll make referrals to our
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud control unit and that
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
unit will investigate and prosecute
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud that unit is interesting
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
because it is mostly federally funded as
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
part of the Medicaid Program generally
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
the state has to have a Medicaid fraud
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
control unit so every state has one of
 
01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.810 align:start position:0%
control unit so every state has one of
these

01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
almost every state has this unit within
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
their attorney general's office and
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
we also have in the criminal justice
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau Cold Case unit that has two
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
full-time attorneys and the Cold Case
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
unit is is dedicated to working on cases
 
01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
by the very definition that have gone
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
cold so cases that are difficult to
 
01:39:22.010 --> 01:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
solve where we've you know we've
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
followed every immediate lead and and
 
01:39:26.570 --> 01:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
we're at a I don't like to call it a
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
dead end because we don't consider any
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
case a dead end and every case we
 
01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
continue to work on until we either
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
solve it or
 
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:34.610 align:start position:0%
solve it or
um

01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
so much time has gone by right that we
 
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
know that the perpetrator must be dead
 
01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:43.620 align:start position:0%
just based on based on math but we we
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
constantly continue to work cold cases
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
we have two attorneys that are dedicated
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
to that work and we have a lot of other
 
01:39:52.370 --> 01:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
attorneys that do some work on cold
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
cases but there are two attorneys who
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
spend their time exclusively on that
 
01:39:57.179 --> 01:40:00.590 align:start position:0%
spend their time exclusively on that
work

01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you how successful has that been
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
can you say for the past five years
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
you've filed 10 cases or something like
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
that or
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
I I don't have exact numbers for you
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
what I would say is I think we have a
 
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
lot of room to improve and how we work
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
cold cases in this state and I think
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
we've we've seen some starts and stops
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
on really getting the Cold Case unit
 
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
going a few years ago there was a lot of
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
talk about dedicating two lawyers to the
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
Cold Case unit that didn't happen right
 
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
away because of covid
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
um and it kind of went by the wayside
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
since I've been in office and as we've
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
come out of the pandemic we're
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
rededicating ourselves to the Cold Case
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
unit so the best way to answer your
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
question there representative is that I
 
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
think we have we have a lot of work to
 
01:40:48.590 --> 01:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
do to get where I think we need to be I
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
every lawyer in the office is dedicated
 
01:40:53.450 --> 01:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
and does great work works very hard but
 
01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
I think we
 
01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
especially in the rural communities in
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
cold cases are important and and being
 
01:41:04.189 --> 01:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
someone who is from you know from the
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
upper valleys from a community outside
 
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Nashua area these cases
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
have a real impact on their communities
 
01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
when they happen so anyway so long
 
01:41:14.090 --> 01:41:14.100 align:start position:0%
answer your question again but we've got
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
the criminal Bureau also has the office
 
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
of victim witness assistance
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
this office
 
01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:26.340 align:start position:0%
has victim Advocates we've got four
 
01:41:29.450 --> 01:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
victim Advocates and they work with
 
01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:30.910 align:start position:0%
victim Advocates and they work with
families

01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
they work with victims they work with
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who are part of our case is to
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
basically get them what they need
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
support them not only during an
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
investigation and during a trial but
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
also afterwards when someone's the
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
victim of a crime and particularly when
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
someone's a victim of a serious crime
 
01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's it's a life-changing event and
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of things that flow from
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
that Beyond just finding the perpetrator
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
and Prosecuting them you know can upend
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
their entire lives so our office of
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
victim witness assistance is sort of
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated to serving those victims and
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
their families and also serving
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
Witnesses often the Witnesses are also
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
victims right and often the most
 
01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:16.860 align:start position:0%
important Witnesses are the victims of
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
the crime but that's where that office
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
is dedicated to that office also does
 
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
the drug task force like I mentioned is
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
also part of the criminal justice Bureau
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
for the most part the drug task force
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
is not comprised of employees of the
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice it's comprised
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
mostly of officers from local
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
departments either Sheriff's departments
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
or local police departments that are on
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
loan from those agencies we do have a
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
commander and a deputy commander of the
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
drug task force and those are full-time
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
employees of of the Attorney General's
 
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.169 align:start position:0%
employees of of the Attorney General's
office

01:42:57.169 --> 01:42:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.179 --> 01:43:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
I should say the criminal justice Bureau
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
also has a public Integrity unit
 
01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
the public Integrity unit is dedicated
 
01:43:10.370 --> 01:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
to Prosecuting crimes committed by state
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
officials law enforcement officials and
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
other other public officials we focus
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
mostly on either State officials or
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
members of law enforcement but we will
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
also take cases
 
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.189 align:start position:0%
also take cases
um

01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
that involve Municipal officials County
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
officials just depending on the
 
01:43:28.609 --> 01:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
circumstance and depending on how
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
and then the last part the criminal
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
justice Bureau that we have right now
 
01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
which is a temporary part of the office
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
but right now a very important part of
 
01:43:42.169 --> 01:43:42.179 align:start position:0%
the office is is the YDC unit so that
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
unit is is focused on Prosecuting the
 
01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.070 align:start position:0%
unit is is focused on Prosecuting the
um

01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
or investigating I should say
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
allegations of sexual abuse and physical
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
abuse at the former YDC and prosecute
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting the perpetrators of of those
 
01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:56.990 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting the perpetrators of of those
crimes

01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
that unit is
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
we have a couple attorneys who are
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated solely to doing that but we
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
have also spread that work throughout
 
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice Bureau because of
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
the volume because of the number of
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
folks who have come forward and frankly
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
just because those cases are difficult
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
and it is it's hard for any one person
 
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:18.380 align:start position:0%
to spend their whole day doing just that
 
01:44:21.649 --> 01:44:21.659 align:start position:0%
as as hardened as our attorneys are and
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
as much as they've seen those types of
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you have
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
there been any successful conclusions to
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
cases in this area
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
no I mean well I should say we we have
 
01:44:40.850 --> 01:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
charged 11 people
 
01:44:43.629 --> 01:44:43.639 align:start position:0%
um for acts against I think it's 21
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
victims we're still waiting for those
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
cases to go to trial the first try the
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
first trials were scheduled to begin
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
this year they've been pushed back given
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
the the volume of documents involved in
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
those trials and also I think given some
 
01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
of the struggles with the public
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
defender program but those trials are
 
01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
still scheduled to take place but no
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
trials have taken place yet so we are
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
gearing up we're doing everything we can
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
to be ready but we are at the mercy of
 
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
the Court's calendar and of document
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
production and the public defender being
 
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:18.790 align:start position:0%
production and the public defender being
ready

01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative hatch thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:22.850 align:start position:0%
representative hatch thank you Mr chair
just

01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
um recent events at the uh sununu Center
 
01:45:30.169 --> 01:45:30.179 align:start position:0%
um numbers that were initially presented
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
to us were a lot more than what you're
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
saying now so
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
um is there a plethora of these pending
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
or or what what's happening with that or
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
what do we need to be prepared for
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
Budget wide says my my concern yeah it's
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
a good question so on the criminal side
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
with YDC
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
and I've had the chance to speak about
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
this a lot as I think many of you
 
01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:53.830 align:start position:0%
this a lot as I think many of you
remember

01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
many many of
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
the allegations we get and
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
um the victims who are coming forward
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
are cases that really aren't cases will
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
ever be able to prosecute because
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're beyond the statute of
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
limitations we still try to at least
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
talk to those victims but you know on
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
from the criminal side it's going to be
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
only a small fraction of of the
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
allegations that we can ever prosecute
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
for partly because of the statute of
 
01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:24.659 align:start position:0%
limitations partly because these are
 
01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:26.699 align:start position:0%
just very old cases and building a case
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
that you can prove Beyond Reasonable
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
Doubt is is already hard in sexual
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
assault cases it's especially hard when
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
they're very old so on the criminal side
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
I think I think we have we have a handle
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
on it I think we we have been able to
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
spread the cases out throughout the
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
office and I think we have the resources
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
we need and we come for the litigation
 
01:46:50.209 --> 01:46:50.219 align:start position:0%
fund when we need it the Civil side's a
 
01:46:52.570 --> 01:46:52.580 align:start position:0%
little a little different yeah yeah
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's a little out of order but just
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
before you leave this page on the
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud control unit are those
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
individuals or Corp or doctors offices
 
01:47:11.770 --> 01:47:11.780 align:start position:0%
or who do you tend to see in that
 
01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:14.699 align:start position:0%
situation yeah in my experience it's
 
01:47:16.970 --> 01:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's individuals so not doctors offices
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
but someone who says that they
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
um got rides to and from a doctor's
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
office they need reimbursement for but
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
they never got the rides or they were
 
01:47:30.530 --> 01:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
getting treatment that they sought
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for they just never
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
actually got that got that treatment so
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
my experience has been we we see mostly
 
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
individuals I think there is probably
 
01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
more work we can do to try to identify
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
whether there's any more white collar
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
fraud going on in either doctor's
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
offices or other health care practices
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
but that's not typically what we've seen
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
in my time in the office
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
then just one other question on the cold
 
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
cases have you seen the number of cold
 
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:00.470 align:start position:0%
cases have you seen the number of cold
cases

01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:48:04.609 --> 01:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
over time or has the office I mean
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
I just wonder if they're building up or
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
my as I said earlier my senses we have
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
we have a way we have some improvement
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
to make and how we handle cold cases but
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
I I can't tell you from a numbers
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
perspective whether we've kind of stayed
 
01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
flat or whether they just keep building
 
01:48:32.810 --> 01:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
the other two bureaus in the division of
 
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
public protection are the consumer
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
protection and antitrust Bureau and the
 
01:48:48.530 --> 01:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau the
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and antitrust Bureau
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
really does three basic things it does
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection work
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
so a great example that we see a lot are
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
contractors who you know you hire
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
someone to do a renovation on your house
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
they take a check for fifty thousand
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
dollars they never do the work
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
our office does those cases and we're
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
kind of the one agency in the state that
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutes those cases we're unique
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
throughout in the country in having
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
criminal jurisdiction over those cases a
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
lot of times those cases are handled
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
civilly we actually have the ability to
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
to prosecute those cases criminally
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
which is effective it's it's a hammer
 
01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:32.699 align:start position:0%
and I think a good a good deterrent but
 
01:49:34.729 --> 01:49:34.739 align:start position:0%
that that's part of what that Bureau
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
does just the basic Consumer Protection
 
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.310 align:start position:0%
does just the basic Consumer Protection
work

01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:49:40.129 --> 01:49:40.139 align:start position:0%
the bureau also does Anti-Trust work
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
so the Anti-Trust unit within the bureau
 
01:49:46.970 --> 01:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
reviews and I'm sure you've seen
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
prominent examples of this reviews
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
mergers between health care companies to
 
01:49:53.450 --> 01:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
see whether there are antitrust concerns
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
it sort of monitors the marketplace to
 
01:49:59.689 --> 01:49:59.699 align:start position:0%
see whether anyone is engaging in
 
01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive conduct or violating
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
the state's Anti-Trust laws we mostly
 
01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.830 align:start position:0%
the state's Anti-Trust laws we mostly
see

01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
transaction based issues that's that's
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
when we tend to see antitrust issues
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
when a merger's taking place we don't
 
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
encounter as much what I call conduct
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
based issues so a company is not merging
 
01:50:22.310 --> 01:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
with another they're just engaging in
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive conduct we don't see as
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
much of that
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
and then that that Bureau also has the
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
elder abuse and financial exploitation
 
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.370 align:start position:0%
elder abuse and financial exploitation
unit

01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I know I'll be talking to you about
 
01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:33.890 align:start position:0%
um I know I'll be talking to you about
this

01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
during our sort of core budget
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
presentation but that is a growing area
 
01:50:40.609 --> 01:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
for the state and that's that's an area
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
that really could use more resources
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're having discussions with the
 
01:50:45.770 --> 01:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
governor's office on that front now and
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have those same
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
discussions with you all once once the
 
01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:49.669 align:start position:0%
discussions with you all once once the
budget

01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
lands on your plate in a couple weeks
 
01:50:54.290 --> 01:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
but that is a um that is a very
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
important part of the office I think
 
01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
within the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a growing area that I
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
think the state needs to focus on
 
01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:07.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:09.659 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely well you said we'll be
 
01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:12.179 align:start position:0%
talking more about it but to what do you
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
attribute the increases in this so
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
there are a number of factors but the
 
01:51:20.930 --> 01:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
two factors that I think are contribute
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
the most to the increase in this are one
 
01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're an aging state right I think we we
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
all know that but two I think the
 
01:51:30.119 --> 01:51:31.850 align:start position:0%
all know that but two I think the
the

01:51:31.850 --> 01:51:31.860 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:31.860 --> 01:51:33.950 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
the gains and technology that we've seen
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years sort of the
 
01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:40.129 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 years sort of the
exponential

01:51:40.129 --> 01:51:40.139 align:start position:0%
exponential
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
um enhancements in technology
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
have opened up a lot of opportunities
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
for fraud and I think what you what you
 
01:51:50.689 --> 01:51:50.699 align:start position:0%
see is a lot of individuals who who they
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
get to an advanced age they may not have
 
01:51:55.729 --> 01:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
been familiar with some of these new
 
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
technologies and
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
if they've never interacted with with
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
technology they are more susceptible to
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
sort of scams over the Internet even
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
scam scams over the phone
 
01:52:10.199 --> 01:52:11.350 align:start position:0%
scam scams over the phone
um

01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
scams even just through paper that are
 
01:52:17.410 --> 01:52:17.420 align:start position:0%
generated through through uh
 
01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.129 align:start position:0%
generated through through uh
technological

01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
technological
 
01:52:21.890 --> 01:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
technological scam so just form letters
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
that are just wrong websites that are
 
01:52:24.239 --> 01:52:25.490 align:start position:0%
that are just wrong websites that are
fake

01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
fake
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
um fake places to go do your taxes right
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
oh go to this website you'll you'll get
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
a tax refund just give me your social
 
01:52:33.410 --> 01:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
security number and all that they're
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
just all sorts of new new opportunities
 
01:52:38.810 --> 01:52:38.820 align:start position:0%
for scamming people over the internet
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
and through technology and I think that
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
combined with an aging population has
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
has contributed to to a real rise in in
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
fraud against the elderly I also think
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic the covid-19 pandemic
 
01:52:57.410 --> 01:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
has contributed to a rise in this over
 
01:52:59.930 --> 01:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years because when
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
people are isolated they're more
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
they're more vulnerable to that type of
 
01:53:09.370 --> 01:53:09.380 align:start position:0%
that type of scam and it
 
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
the final factor I would say that's
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
important is it's just kind of a human
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
factor I think
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
someone who gets older
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know maybe your spouse has died your
 
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
kids live far away you're just we just
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
see people when they don't have social
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
interaction more susceptible to to
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
someone just calling them up over the
 
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
phone and befriending them and
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
engaging in some type of scam so
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
those are the reasons
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's always been there but I think it's
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
gotten worse
 
01:53:44.810 --> 01:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
so are you looking for more staff there
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I might take away or yeah do
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
you have a specific number that you're
 
01:53:49.490 --> 01:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
looking at or
 
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
yeah we we have requested an additional
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer an additional paralegal and
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
additional investigator right now that
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
unit it's a fairly new unit it only has
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
one dedicated lawyer and no dedicated
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
investigator or paralegal so there
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of room for growth there
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
I never think it's a good idea to grow
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
any particular unit too fast because you
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to sort of
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
really see how much how much work there
 
01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
is to do but but that's what we've
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
requested in the governor's budget
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
process and that's what I anticipate
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
that's what will be before you because I
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak for the governor
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
or get out ahead of him but I I am
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
fairly optimistic that that will make it
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
into his budget but those are the
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
numbers a new attorney a new
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
investigator and a new apparently and a
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
new paralegal
 
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
sounds like a very good idea to me yeah
 
01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
and while we're on it I just want to
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
thank your charitable trust group
 
01:54:49.729 --> 01:54:49.739 align:start position:0%
thought they did an amazing job with the
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
granite one Dartmouth merger and just
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
want to thank they did very thorough
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
work and absolutely appreciate it so yes
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
and our antitrust unit was working on
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
that too so I just want to give them a
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
shout out thanks yeah
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else representative
 
01:55:07.850 --> 01:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
McGuire I see a few questions here on
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
your sheep he lets me know he writes
 
01:55:12.169 --> 01:55:12.179 align:start position:0%
them ahead of time so he checked them
 
01:55:12.179 --> 01:55:13.669 align:start position:0%
them ahead of time so he checked them
off

01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
well we're running low at times yeah so
 
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
keep going yeah I was just if it was
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
anything pressing on your list there
 
01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.129 align:start position:0%
anything pressing on your list there
okay

01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
we'll continue then yeah the
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Bureau is
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward so I won't spend
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
a ton of time there basically
 
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
we bring environmental enforcement
 
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
actions in that Bureau and we also we
 
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
provide client counseling services to
 
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:37.139 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the Environmental Protection
 
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
Bureau does it has five lawyers and and
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
some staff but that that Bureau uh
 
01:55:48.890 --> 01:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
basically serves Des it also works with
 
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
I'm now sort of moving over to the
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
division of legal counsel that's more
 
01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
the Civil side of the office
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
within the division of legal counsel we
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
have the civil litigation unit and the
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
client counseling unit and those two
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
things make up what we call the Civil
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
Bureau so the civil litigation unit does
 
01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what it sounds like it does it
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
defends the state state agencies
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
employees State officials in litigation
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's brought against them so we have
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
um that unit there is a lot of work in
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
that unit right now the state is dealing
 
01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
with a lot of major cases a lot of major
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
litigation we have I think we have the
 
01:56:47.810 --> 01:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
resources appropriated to it necessary
 
01:56:49.609 --> 01:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's a unit within the office and
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeing this in a lot of places in
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
state government where we just have
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
civil litigators are particularly hard
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
to hire in state service because unlike
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutors where if you want to be a
 
01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
prosecutor the Attorney General's office
 
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
is the best place to be in the state
 
01:57:06.590 --> 01:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
as a civil litigator I think you get to
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
do really cool work I think it's really
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
fulfilling work but you can make a lot
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
of money in private practice you don't
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
make you know you can't be a prosecutor
 
01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
in private practice right if you want to
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
be a prosecutor you got to come work in
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
public service if you want to be a civil
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
litigator you can work in the private
 
01:57:23.450 --> 01:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
sector and make a lot more money so I
 
01:57:25.850 --> 01:57:25.860 align:start position:0%
think we have great lawyers who are
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
handling the work we're getting done
 
01:57:30.350 --> 01:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
what we need to get done but the
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
workforce to the extent we have
 
01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges in the Department
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
of Justice the civil litigation unit is
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
our biggest challenge and you see that I
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
know representative leishman sees that
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
when we come to fiscal for money in the
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
litigation fund because when we're down
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers we have to get some assistance
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
from outside counsel and that's when we
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
come to the litigation fund
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
the client counseling unit is is also
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
they they're civil attorneys they they
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
work with state agencies they to
 
01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative Abel's question earlier
 
01:58:03.229 --> 01:58:03.239 align:start position:0%
they interface with the lawyers who are
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
in state agencies
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
their goal really is to keep the state
 
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:08.820 align:start position:0%
out of court so to make sure everyone's
 
01:58:10.609 --> 01:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
complying with the law staying in their
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
Lane doing what they need to do so that
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
we don't end up in litigation it's
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
really what the client counseling unit
 
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:19.490 align:start position:0%
really what the client counseling unit
does

01:58:19.490 --> 01:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
within the division of legal counsel we
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
also have the transportation and
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
construction Bureau it's kind of a
 
01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:26.820 align:start position:0%
deceptively named Bureau because it
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
works with the Department of
 
01:58:29.629 --> 01:58:29.639 align:start position:0%
Transportation but it also works with
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety
 
01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:33.659 align:start position:0%
so that Bureau is unique because it is
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
mostly funded by Highway funds and it
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
works pretty much exclusively with only
 
01:58:39.890 --> 01:58:39.900 align:start position:0%
two agencies the Department of
 
01:58:41.450 --> 01:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
Transportation and the Department of
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
Safety but given that dot and the
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
department of safety are two of the
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
biggest agencies in state government it
 
01:58:52.370 --> 01:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
it certainly provides enough work for
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
one Bureau it's a pretty small Bureau
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust unit is the primary
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
regulator of charities in the state in
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
that in that unit we we register
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
Charities we oversee Charities and
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
ensure they're they're complying with
 
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
their obligations and we do that by
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
getting annual filings that Charities
 
01:59:16.970 --> 01:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
have to make each year so we're both
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring to make sure Charities are
 
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
filing what they're supposed to file and
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing those filings to ensure
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:29.330 --> 01:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the debt Recovery
 
01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:31.310 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the debt Recovery
Unit

01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
Unit
 
01:59:33.830 --> 01:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
the debt Recovery Unit does again kind
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
of exactly what it sounds like it does
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
it it attempts to recover debts that are
 
01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
owed to the state and as I mentioned
 
01:59:42.649 --> 01:59:42.659 align:start position:0%
earlier that that can be anywhere from
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
unpaid taxes from long long ago because
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
will handle recently unpaid tax bills
 
01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:52.380 align:start position:0%
but if we discover taxes that have long
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
gone unpaid might get referred to our
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
debt Recovery Unit if there's a we had a
 
01:59:59.689 --> 01:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
contract with a vendor the state had a
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
contract with a vendor and they didn't
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
perform work or they owe us money we may
 
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
go after that vendor through the debt
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
Recovery Unit
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
that unit is small it only has one
 
02:00:11.209 --> 02:00:11.219 align:start position:0%
lawyer there is
 
02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
probably more work the state could do
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
there we have not done a full analysis
 
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
of that but I just mentioned that given
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
this committee's role in the legislature
 
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're recovering all
 
02:00:26.030 --> 02:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
debt so to the state is probably an area
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
that that we could we could use some
 
02:00:32.270 --> 02:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
growth in and we could explore ways to
 
02:00:35.050 --> 02:00:35.060 align:start position:0%
recover monies owed to the state
 
02:00:38.209 --> 02:00:38.219 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin do you have an
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
idea of the magnitude of the recoveries
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
from that unit
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't but that's information I could
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you
 
02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
it's kind of what
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
because I'd be interested in a return on
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
investment like if you had more staff do
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
you think you could really
 
02:01:03.229 --> 02:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
yep bring in a lot more
 
02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I think what would be worth doing
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
on that front is uh
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
is an analysis or a study on that you
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
know as I mentioned that that's just
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
something I've observed we have not and
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think the office has at any time
 
02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
in recent memory done a full analysis of
 
02:01:23.689 --> 02:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
that like if we had another lawyer if we
 
02:01:25.310 --> 02:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
had these resources
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
how much out there is there owed to the
 
02:01:29.390 --> 02:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
state that could be recovered so I think
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a project worth undertaking
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.570 --> 02:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
the other two components of the division
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
of legal counsel are the election law
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
unit and the Civil Rights unit
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
um so again these are
 
02:01:47.810 --> 02:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
what these units do is kind of explained
 
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
by their titles but the election law
 
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
unit both
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
um prosecutes violations of the state's
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
election laws it works with the
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to ensure that our
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
elections are run well and they're run
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
in compliance with the law
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
every election day we send attorneys
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
from the office out to just about every
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
polling place in the state they they
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
rotate around the state they travel all
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
around the state and we cover we cover
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much every polling place and the
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
goal is to make sure we're assisting
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
local election officials but that we're
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
also not far away if an issue comes up
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
and and there's a dispute on site about
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
what someone's allowed to do or
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
um what an election official should or
 
02:02:34.609 --> 02:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
um that unit also works with
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities so it works with local
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
election officials leading up to
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
elections on training
 
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
um on Election law compliance and just
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
on basic tips for how to run an
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
efficient election as you can imagine
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
that the needs of various polling places
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
vary a lot you know Manchester is a lot
 
02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
different than our small towns in the
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
North country and the election law unit
 
02:03:00.770 --> 02:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
works with the secretary of state to try
 
02:03:03.169 --> 02:03:03.179 align:start position:0%
to fill those gaps where there may not
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
be as many resources in the municipality
 
02:03:05.639 --> 02:03:07.550 align:start position:0%
be as many resources in the municipality
itself

02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
itself
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights unit again sort of
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
similar to the election law unit it
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
enforces the state civil rights laws we
 
02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
also try to do some work on on the
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
training front so we try to put out
 
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
information for law enforcement on how
 
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
to spot civil rights violations we try
 
02:03:26.089 --> 02:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
to make information available to
 
02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
businesses so so they have an idea of
 
02:03:30.410 --> 02:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
what they need to comply with and that
 
02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
unit works a lot with the Human Rights
 
02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:33.609 align:start position:0%
unit works a lot with the Human Rights
Commission

02:03:33.609 --> 02:03:33.619 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
again we already kind of covered the
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
office of solicitor general but I'll
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
just hit it again here briefly that
 
02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
office it's really two major functions
 
02:03:52.370 --> 02:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
are to oversee all of the appeals but
 
02:03:54.290 --> 02:03:54.300 align:start position:0%
then the Attorney General's office so
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
both Criminal Appeals and Civil Appeals
 
02:03:59.770 --> 02:03:59.780 align:start position:0%
and also to kind of guide legal strategy
 
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
so I get the solicitor general and his
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
staff involved in major litigation that
 
02:04:07.129 --> 02:04:07.139 align:start position:0%
we anticipate is going to result in an
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
appeal so when we know we have a big
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
case that we that we are litigating at
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
the trial court level but that we
 
02:04:15.649 --> 02:04:15.659 align:start position:0%
anticipate is going to go up to the
 
02:04:18.290 --> 02:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
state supreme court or go up on appeal
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
through the federal system we try to
 
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
anticipate the major issues right from
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the start knowing that we're going to be
 
02:04:27.530 --> 02:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
fighting it out on appeal no matter what
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
happens whether we win or lose we're
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
appealing so that's really the role of
 
02:04:32.810 --> 02:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
the office of solicitor general it's
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
still a fairly new office in our
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
department of justice the solicitor
 
02:04:38.089 --> 02:04:38.099 align:start position:0%
general position was just created I
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
think back in 2018 in this state but I
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
think it's a very very good function for
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
us to have
 
02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:52.370 align:start position:0%
us to have
foreign

02:04:52.370 --> 02:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.050 --> 02:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
and then I talked about it earlier but
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
I'll just hit it again briefly the
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
office of the chief medical examiner it
 
02:04:59.570 --> 02:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't really fit into either sort of
 
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
the division of public protection or the
 
02:05:02.930 --> 02:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
division of legal counsel because it's
 
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
its own independent entity but the
 
02:05:07.550 --> 02:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
office of the chief medical examiner
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
performs death investigations and
 
02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
performs autopsies and it also does a
 
02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
lot of work to coordinate a collection
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
and production of data related to deaths
 
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the state so overdose deaths for
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
instance when you see that data that
 
02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
really comes out of the office of the of
 
02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:27.060 align:start position:0%
the chief medical examiner because
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're seeing all the deaths they're
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
collecting the causes of death they're
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
seeing the toxicology reports so they're
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
in the best position to collect and
 
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
and then the final piece of the office
 
02:05:45.649 --> 02:05:45.659 align:start position:0%
of like any office we we have just basic
 
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
Administration functions that don't deal
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
with core substantive legal issues but
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
really just help us run run the office
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
and and seek grant funding so that's the
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
director of of administration again that
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
has the director of Law Office
 
02:06:04.129 --> 02:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so the person who
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
basically oversees the the technology
 
02:06:07.570 --> 02:06:07.580 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure needs of the office
 
02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.250 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure needs of the office
that

02:06:09.250 --> 02:06:09.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
division of the office has the business
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
office which just handles payroll and
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
accounting services
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
that division has the victim's
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
compensation unit which works to take in
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
applications and pay out compensation to
 
02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%
victims of crime and then that division
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
has the grants management and strategic
 
02:06:28.490 --> 02:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
initiatives unit and the grants
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
management unit again I mentioned it
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
earlier but its job is really to to seek
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
out opportunities to bring grant funding
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
in into the state both for the
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice itself for state
 
02:06:42.770 --> 02:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
agencies for local agencies and for
 
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
private organizations like for instance
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
the Coalition against Domestic and
 
02:06:48.649 --> 02:06:48.659 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that that is an overview of the
 
02:06:52.850 --> 02:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
functions of the Attorney General's
 
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
office to representative McGuire's
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
question I didn't bring specific head
 
02:06:59.689 --> 02:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
counts and numbers because I I thought I
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
my understanding was this was more just
 
02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:03.179 align:start position:0%
to give you a sense of what we do but we
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
will certainly have all of that ready
 
02:07:07.729 --> 02:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
for you as you enter the budget process
 
02:07:09.770 --> 02:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
and when we come for our budget
 
02:07:11.689 --> 02:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
presentation I will make sure you have
 
02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
that information I'll make sure to get
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
that information to you in advance and I
 
02:07:19.250 --> 02:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
think you're going to get that as part
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
of the budget I mean my having spent too
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
much time with the budget I worked on
 
02:07:25.490 --> 02:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
three governors budgets in my time when
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
I was with the governor I know that in
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
the section for each agency it gives you
 
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
a great breakdown of of headcount but
 
02:07:34.189 --> 02:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure we have that information
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
for you when you're when you've got the
 
02:07:39.850 --> 02:07:39.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
you'll find the Attorney General's
 
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
budget is quite detailed and doing a
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
great job you've stepped into the shoes
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
of a number of people in the past and
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
you're a credit to the agency from my
 
02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
experience so thank you I appreciate it
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
just speaking for myself but that's been
 
02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
my experience I appreciate that thank
 
02:08:00.109 --> 02:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair representative McGuire
 
02:08:02.570 --> 02:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah I'm
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
particularly impressed by the size of
 
02:08:06.130 --> 02:08:06.140 align:start position:0%
your entourage here because
 
02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
your entourage here because
[Laughter]

02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
we often see you know two three Etc but
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
that to me is a sign of good deficiency
 
02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
um we are in a fish in office I do
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
believe we are not over resourced in any
 
02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:22.250 align:start position:0%
believe we are not over resourced in any
way

02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
um let me ask specifically is your
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
office ever on both sides of a case if
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
we have like a whistleblower who figures
 
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
out some agency is doing something wrong
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
are you defending that agency and
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting it that is such a timely
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
question I mean I mean the answer is yes
 
02:08:45.530 --> 02:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
right so YDC is a good example you know
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
technically in YDC we're not on both
 
02:08:50.570 --> 02:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
sides of the case because we're we're
 
02:08:53.209 --> 02:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting the individual perpetrators
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
right we are defending the agency so
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
we're not defending the individuals
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're defending the agency to the extent
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
their allegations that the agency was
 
02:09:06.770 --> 02:09:06.780 align:start position:0%
negligent in supervising the the former
 
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
YDC workers but yeah we are we are at at
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
least to the public on both sides in
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
that case we also have cases where
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
you know we represent the puc
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
we represent the department of energy
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
we represent the consumer Advocate right
 
02:09:24.119 --> 02:09:26.030 align:start position:0%
we represent the consumer Advocate right
so

02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:29.390 --> 02:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
um the puc May issue a decision that
 
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
gets appealed
 
02:09:33.050 --> 02:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate may want to take
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
one position on that appeal so we're
 
02:09:36.950 --> 02:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
representing the puc on appeal somebody
 
02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
else is in the office is representing
 
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate and then the
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy may have a position
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
in that and so someone else in the
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
office is representing the department of
 
02:09:45.599 --> 02:09:46.490 align:start position:0%
office is representing the department of
energy

02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
we have procedures that have been in
 
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
place in the office for a long time
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
where we put up walls in those cases so
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
we make sure that those lawyers are not
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
talking to each other they know nothing
 
02:09:57.530 --> 02:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
about what the other lawyers are doing
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's a big enough office that we can do
 
02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:01.619 align:start position:0%
that but we do have instances like that
 
02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
where we're on the opposite side of a
 
02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:07.669 align:start position:0%
where we're on the opposite side of a
case

02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no further question again thanks
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
very much and we'll see you in a couple
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
of weeks absolutely you can bring
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
Catherine next time too yeah yeah cat I
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
think Kathy Carr will be here when we
 
02:10:19.729 --> 02:10:19.739 align:start position:0%
get into the real budget weeds that's
 
02:10:21.410 --> 02:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:36.599 --> 02:25:11.809 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:25:11.809 --> 02:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.730 --> 02:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:42.910 --> 03:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.130 --> 03:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
all right uh being just a few minutes
 
03:06:48.769 --> 03:06:48.779 align:start position:0%
after one Charlie time
 
03:06:48.779 --> 03:06:50.210 align:start position:0%
after one Charlie time
um

03:06:50.210 --> 03:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
we have some amendments at the
 
03:06:56.330 --> 03:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative evil would like to ask
 
03:06:59.809 --> 03:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
the LBA to pass out on
 
03:07:26.690 --> 03:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.849 --> 03:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
so the Amendments you're about to
 
03:07:32.750 --> 03:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
receive is someone of the result of
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
most the work being done by
 
03:07:36.670 --> 03:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative evil over the weekend
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
working with some of us Charlie
 
03:07:41.809 --> 03:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus has been very helpful
 
03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
in this process and while we're taking a
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
look at the language is uh Charlie would
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
you like to come forward and
 
03:07:50.760 --> 03:07:52.250 align:start position:0%
you like to come forward and
give

03:07:52.250 --> 03:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
give
 
03:07:56.690 --> 03:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you have hard questions I have with
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
me uh Karen ransomaki and Ted kupper who
 
03:08:05.389 --> 03:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
are smarter than I am but um we so we we
 
03:08:07.730 --> 03:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
talked um
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil had you know
 
03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
concerns about oversight and and
 
03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
obviously we want oversight and we I
 
03:08:15.290 --> 03:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
actually like the idea of renaming the
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget committee to the capital
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
projects committee because it's it's not
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
about source of funding it's about type
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
of project and uh
 
03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know we're always happy we're always
 
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
happier when somebody's looking over our
 
03:08:31.070 --> 03:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
shoulders so to speak because it's it's
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
the way things are meant to be so so I
 
03:08:34.370 --> 03:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
like the idea of doing this and I think
 
03:08:37.130 --> 03:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
the I think the the amendment and and I
 
03:08:38.570 --> 03:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
think I saw the final draft of it or
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
something pretty close to it
 
03:08:41.809 --> 03:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
um I think it does a good job of
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
basically doing that and saying for this
 
03:08:47.929 --> 03:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
particular project we should have a uh a
 
03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
more formalized uh oversight committee
 
03:08:52.370 --> 03:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
with multiple people on it and I I think
 
03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
that'll be very useful because it's um
 
03:08:57.410 --> 03:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there's great
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
interest in the legislature as a whole
 
03:09:01.849 --> 03:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
about this particular construction
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
project and so we would like to
 
03:09:08.330 --> 03:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
suck up to that so to speak
 
03:09:11.630 --> 03:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
well well said as it was stated when you
 
03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
were here last time you know I'm
 
03:09:16.190 --> 03:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself but thinking I'm
 
03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
speaking for everybody we have a great
 
03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
deal of respect for you and how you
 
03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
handle the steam project and other
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
projects and believe you're very much
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
involvement with your folks is necessary
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:09:35.450 --> 03:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
I think this cleans things up a little
 
03:09:37.550 --> 03:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
bit it makes it very clear it allows for
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
a public member to be appointed I did
 
03:09:42.730 --> 03:09:42.740 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
03:09:45.410 --> 03:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
several people of the weekend including
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
Senate President Bradley uh former
 
03:09:51.550 --> 03:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
Senate President Morse
 
03:09:54.469 --> 03:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
who I've said publicly I guess that I'd
 
03:09:56.570 --> 03:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
like to see involved in this group
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
because of his expertise and
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
um someone I greatly respect so
 
03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
hopefully all of you have had a chance
 
03:10:07.990 --> 03:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
to look at this or if
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative evil would like to add
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:18.769 --> 03:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman so just as a
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
general matter I've had an ongoing
 
03:10:23.889 --> 03:10:23.899 align:start position:0%
concern about capital
 
03:10:27.130 --> 03:10:27.140 align:start position:0%
projects that are coming through our
 
03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
legislature that uh
 
03:10:33.170 --> 03:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
if they if if they're generally funded
 
03:10:35.090 --> 03:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
they come through the finance committee
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
if their capital budget item they come
 
03:10:40.610 --> 03:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
through the public works and in public
 
03:10:43.990 --> 03:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
works there's a real sort of clear
 
03:10:48.530 --> 03:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
pathway for oversight but for for a
 
03:10:51.290 --> 03:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
capital budget items but for some reason
 
03:10:53.630 --> 03:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's not a similar mechanism for
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
things that come through finance things
 
03:10:58.790 --> 03:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
that are financed through arpa funds I
 
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
mean there's a whole host of capital
 
03:11:03.230 --> 03:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
projects where the whole oversight
 
03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
mechanism is a little fuzzy and so
 
03:11:08.100 --> 03:11:08.690 align:start position:0%
mechanism is a little fuzzy and so
um

03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:11.809 --> 03:11:11.819 align:start position:0%
I also think that the legislative
 
03:11:14.690 --> 03:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
parking garage which is a 25 million
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
dollar item is a huge project and the
 
03:11:20.889 --> 03:11:20.899 align:start position:0%
oversight was a little fuzzy there too
 
03:11:23.090 --> 03:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
so I thought
 
03:11:26.450 --> 03:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
um for after discussions with various
 
03:11:26.460 --> 03:11:27.950 align:start position:0%
um for after discussions with various
people

03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I worked to put together this
 
03:11:34.250 --> 03:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
amendment which was basically make the
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget overview committee the
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
capital project overview committee and
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
I've just basically replaced the word
 
03:11:44.650 --> 03:11:44.660 align:start position:0%
budget with project
 
03:11:49.550 --> 03:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
but as the chairman indicated there's a
 
03:11:49.560 --> 03:11:51.010 align:start position:0%
but as the chairman indicated there's a
special

03:11:51.010 --> 03:11:51.020 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:11:55.790 --> 03:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
sense of of the structure that we would
 
03:11:58.450 --> 03:11:58.460 align:start position:0%
need for the legislative parking garage
 
03:12:02.570 --> 03:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
oversight and so we put together this
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
commission which tracks a little bit
 
03:12:08.389 --> 03:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
like the capital budget over
 
03:12:11.389 --> 03:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
site committee but with a couple of
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
tweaks it does allow the appointment at
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
the option of the president of the
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
Senate and the speaker of the house to
 
03:12:22.730 --> 03:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
to appoint public members
 
03:12:25.490 --> 03:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
um we do have the commissioner of Das or
 
03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
designee on there and we do have the
 
03:12:30.230 --> 03:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
chairman of house Public Works
 
03:12:33.530 --> 03:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
on there and house finance or their
 
03:12:36.650 --> 03:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
designees and so that pulls in the
 
03:12:39.469 --> 03:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
capital committee which is public works
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
it pulls in finance which is the source
 
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
of the general funds and it also has
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
other legislators that are involved
 
03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:49.610 align:start position:0%
other legislators that are involved
um

03:12:49.610 --> 03:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the upshot of it the other
 
03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
thing is it makes it really clear that
 
03:12:56.090 --> 03:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
the legislative members are there for
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
their term but the public members can
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
stay in place until they're replaced or
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
upon completion of the project and then
 
03:13:08.389 --> 03:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
it it sets up sort of a six-month
 
03:13:08.399 --> 03:13:10.670 align:start position:0%
it it sets up sort of a six-month
overview

03:13:10.670 --> 03:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
overview
 
03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:11.389 align:start position:0%
overview
um

03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:14.750 --> 03:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
calendar for the legislative parking
 
03:13:17.210 --> 03:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
garage oversight commission but they're
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
also going to be providing information
 
03:13:22.610 --> 03:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
to the capital project overview
 
03:13:26.929 --> 03:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
committee so that's the upshot and I
 
03:13:30.230 --> 03:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
I mean I think the main idea here
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
when you have such an expensive project
 
03:13:37.010 --> 03:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about having a very
 
03:13:40.070 --> 03:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
clear line as to procedures and you want
 
03:13:42.410 --> 03:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
to have the oversight
 
03:13:45.230 --> 03:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
um and transparency
 
03:13:49.130 --> 03:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
I just felt like this is the way to go
 
03:13:51.769 --> 03:13:51.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if I could just add on that
 
03:13:53.809 --> 03:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
which would I think was very well put
 
03:13:55.730 --> 03:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
03:13:55.740 --> 03:13:56.450 align:start position:0%
um I think that
um

03:13:56.450 --> 03:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:59.330 --> 03:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
leaving aside the garage itself one of
 
03:14:01.429 --> 03:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
the things that that this does is in you
 
03:14:02.929 --> 03:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
know back in the day it was unusual to
 
03:14:04.190 --> 03:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
have capital projects that weren't
 
03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
funded for the capital budget that's
 
03:14:07.190 --> 03:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
just where they went and that's why the
 
03:14:09.469 --> 03:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
law is constructed the way it was in
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
recent years we've had some you know
 
03:14:13.490 --> 03:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
some weird stuff going on where
 
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
um we've had a whole bunch of them that
 
03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know it used to be that if you had a
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
capital project that wasn't through the
 
03:14:21.650 --> 03:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
capital budget was really unusual and
 
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
some sort of one-off and but you know we
 
03:14:25.130 --> 03:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
had arpa and there have been some of
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
these these Surplus things in
 
03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
Centerville or Hospital 2 Appropriations
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
and all of that and I think uh I don't
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
think anyone would argue that the intent
 
03:14:35.210 --> 03:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh going back to the formation of that
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
committee whenever that was
 
03:14:40.030 --> 03:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
um was to oversee projects of this type
 
03:14:42.590 --> 03:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
not just projects that happen to be in
 
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill 25 they didn't mean to
 
03:14:46.250 --> 03:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
exclude projects that happened to be in
 
03:14:48.830 --> 03:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill too so I think it's a I think
 
03:14:50.889 --> 03:14:50.899 align:start position:0%
it's a nice thing and it's not frankly
 
03:14:53.929 --> 03:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
revolutionary so it's just a just good
 
03:14:56.330 --> 03:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
oversight government
 
03:14:59.929 --> 03:14:59.939 align:start position:0%
very glad to have your involvement uh so
 
03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're speaking specifically to Amendment
 
03:15:06.650 --> 03:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
zero three eight four h you see there's
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
another amendment which will be taken up
 
03:15:10.490 --> 03:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
separately as far as the funding so
 
03:15:13.010 --> 03:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
we'll speak to that later is there any
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
more discussion yes representative
 
03:15:18.530 --> 03:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman
 
03:15:21.530 --> 03:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so the beginning part here
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
um about the capital budget now project
 
03:15:27.290 --> 03:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
overview committee is that strictly a
 
03:15:29.929 --> 03:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
name change and and doesn't really have
 
03:15:32.150 --> 03:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
much to do with the parking garage
 
03:15:34.610 --> 03:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's strictly a name change
 
03:15:38.330 --> 03:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay and and so you
 
03:15:40.429 --> 03:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
um decided not to make the parking
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
garage thing like a subcommittee of that
 
03:15:44.750 --> 03:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee you you created a brand new
 
03:15:47.389 --> 03:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
one is that right
 
03:15:50.570 --> 03:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
there was there was conversation about
 
03:15:53.929 --> 03:15:53.939 align:start position:0%
that uh original drafts that I
 
03:15:56.090 --> 03:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
circulated I did have it as a
 
03:15:58.190 --> 03:15:58.200 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the capital budget
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
overview Committee in fact one idea that
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
I had was just to add a couple of
 
03:16:07.250 --> 03:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
capital uh a couple of public members to
 
03:16:09.530 --> 03:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
that committee to act as the oversight
 
03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
but there's so many folks on that
 
03:16:15.410 --> 03:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
committee it seemed unwieldy and there
 
03:16:18.010 --> 03:16:18.020 align:start position:0%
was a lot of interest in um
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring that uh the Das
 
03:16:24.830 --> 03:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative beyond the legislative
 
03:16:27.769 --> 03:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
parking garage oversight commission so
 
03:16:30.530 --> 03:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
that's what is put together here it's a
 
03:16:33.290 --> 03:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
smaller group of people
 
03:16:36.070 --> 03:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
um and people that have a real interest
 
03:16:39.230 --> 03:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
in this project
 
03:16:41.330 --> 03:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
blame me if you don't like that part of
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
it no that's fine I I don't really have
 
03:16:46.849 --> 03:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
an objection to this but I just let you
 
03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
know that just this morning in the
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
chairs meeting the speaker and the clerk
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
told us don't start anymore commissions
 
03:16:57.889 --> 03:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
committees Etc and if you do you'll be
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
on it so I hope you'll I hope you are
 
03:17:01.080 --> 03:17:02.330 align:start position:0%
on it so I hope you'll I hope you are
prepared

03:17:02.330 --> 03:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
03:17:02.340 --> 03:17:03.950 align:start position:0%
prepared
hahaha

03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
hahaha
 
03:17:08.050 --> 03:17:08.060 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean I I 100
 
03:17:11.510 --> 03:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh view I mean I hold
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
that view myself but I think this is a
 
03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:14.870 align:start position:0%
that view myself but I think this is a
very

03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:17:16.730 --> 03:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
I know other people might argue the same
 
03:17:18.530 --> 03:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
about their commissions I think this is
 
03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
a particular uh
 
03:17:24.349 --> 03:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
um situation where we need oversight of
 
03:17:28.969 --> 03:17:28.979 align:start position:0%
this type by the legislature and I would
 
03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
like to think that the Senate President
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the speaker would
 
03:17:35.950 --> 03:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
um applaud this
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
commission's creation
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:43.370 --> 03:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
um just about the powers of this
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee right or commission
 
03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
um it looks like they have the power to
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
say no to a change in the plans but not
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
a power to create a change of plans is
 
03:18:00.769 --> 03:18:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
so what what I would say is that's the
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
way it is with the capital budget
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
overview committee too it's an oversight
 
03:18:10.490 --> 03:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
Authority I think that's what's true
 
03:18:12.889 --> 03:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
with most oversight authorities I think
 
03:18:15.410 --> 03:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to pursue a change there
 
03:18:17.030 --> 03:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
might have to be some other mechanism
 
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar and I mean I don't know
 
03:18:23.090 --> 03:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
how it would work with public works or I
 
03:18:24.830 --> 03:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
mean maybe the commissioner could help
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
with I think
 
03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:26.929 align:start position:0%
with I think
um

03:18:26.929 --> 03:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
I I think that's not that unusual in in
 
03:18:33.290 --> 03:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
so the way that you know a project is
 
03:18:36.230 --> 03:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
designed there are project managers
 
03:18:38.330 --> 03:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
their Architects Etc I'm more involved
 
03:18:39.650 --> 03:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
in the committee and and there are
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
regular meetings
 
03:18:41.520 --> 03:18:42.230 align:start position:0%
regular meetings
um

03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:43.790 --> 03:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things you want to
 
03:18:45.769 --> 03:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
avoid is the is the point where you have
 
03:18:47.809 --> 03:18:47.819 align:start position:0%
a committee of Architects
 
03:18:49.130 --> 03:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you know buildings designed by a
 
03:18:50.330 --> 03:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
committee as opposed to an architect
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
whose designs have been approved by a
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
committee and I think the you know the
 
03:18:56.090 --> 03:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
language and I forget the exact wording
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
of it which is um
 
03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
you know no change shall be made
 
03:19:03.830 --> 03:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
no change shall be made so um without
 
03:19:06.170 --> 03:19:06.180 align:start position:0%
their approval what we're what we're
 
03:19:09.290 --> 03:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
really talking about doing is we're
 
03:19:11.210 --> 03:19:11.220 align:start position:0%
going to hire an architect
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
and and that architect with with
 
03:19:15.650 --> 03:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
Consultants is not literally one guy
 
03:19:18.050 --> 03:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
sitting at a big desk but um it's going
 
03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
to design the building
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
and you know there'll be input what what
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
typically happens on any project is
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
there's input but uh there's a there's a
 
03:19:28.610 --> 03:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
project manager at um at Public Works in
 
03:19:30.889 --> 03:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
this case it'll be an architect
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um uh named Keith Hemingway I think it's
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
Keith right yeah so there's uh and so
 
03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
they'll go through that and then and
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
then this Committee in an early stage
 
03:19:40.849 --> 03:19:40.859 align:start position:0%
would be involved at looking at those
 
03:19:43.010 --> 03:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
plans but not sitting down and
 
03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
discussing the the details and at that
 
03:19:48.950 --> 03:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
point there's a design you finalize the
 
03:19:51.170 --> 03:19:51.180 align:start position:0%
committee will have signed off on it and
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
then and then the thought is we won't
 
03:19:54.410 --> 03:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
make any changes we'll probably have a
 
03:19:55.490 --> 03:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
discussion at the beginning of the
 
03:19:56.570 --> 03:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
committee about
 
03:19:58.910 --> 03:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
about you know level right the you know
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
minor change orders versus major change
 
03:20:02.809 --> 03:20:02.819 align:start position:0%
orders because projects have lots and
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
lots of change orders
 
03:20:06.530 --> 03:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and decided what what accounts for
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
that but what you what you don't want to
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
have as a as a you know committee who's
 
03:20:13.969 --> 03:20:13.979 align:start position:0%
was designing it themselves if you know
 
03:20:17.450 --> 03:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:21.410 --> 03:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at uh section five repeal
 
03:20:28.849 --> 03:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
and section six perspective repeal and
 
03:20:31.309 --> 03:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
section seven effective date
 
03:20:33.889 --> 03:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
and how do those three sections fit
 
03:20:33.899 --> 03:20:42.650 align:start position:0%
and how do those three sections fit
together

03:20:42.650 --> 03:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:46.130 --> 03:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
sure that the that the commission that
 
03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
we would be creating goes away when the
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
project is over
 
03:20:56.269 --> 03:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
um and I would say that the creation of
 
03:20:58.190 --> 03:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
the commission or the requirement that
 
03:21:00.230 --> 03:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
the commission be created be effective
 
03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
immediately because the project is
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
already uh on its way and we need
 
03:21:06.180 --> 03:21:07.969 align:start position:0%
already uh on its way and we need
oversight

03:21:07.969 --> 03:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:21:13.130 --> 03:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:21.530 --> 03:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.170 --> 03:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
no not a problem rip
 
03:21:26.090 --> 03:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I would just say
 
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
that OLS has been over this and I'm sure
 
03:21:32.929 --> 03:21:32.939 align:start position:0%
the way they've structured it would work
 
03:21:38.510 --> 03:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.150 --> 03:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
I think I can clarify just briefly the
 
03:21:42.830 --> 03:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
the effective date Partners means the
 
03:21:45.530 --> 03:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
bill is effective and then the repeal
 
03:21:47.210 --> 03:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
um basically just says that when when
 
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
the garage is done and we say it's done
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
everything goes away
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
and that this isn't one of those things
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
that exists in perpetuity so that you
 
03:21:58.250 --> 03:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
know in 2046 somebody goes what's that
 
03:21:58.260 --> 03:21:58.969 align:start position:0%
know in 2046 somebody goes what's that
about

03:21:58.969 --> 03:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you that's the way I read it but I
 
03:22:03.050 --> 03:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:09.230 --> 03:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative evil well and and to
 
03:22:09.240 --> 03:22:10.730 align:start position:0%
representative evil well and and to
representative

03:22:10.730 --> 03:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:10.740 --> 03:22:11.690 align:start position:0%
representative
um

03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:14.210 --> 03:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
I drank a blank Maguire's point about
 
03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
the uh speaker not loving commissions
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's one of the big problems with
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
commissions is that they live on in
 
03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
perpetuity and this one will have a very
 
03:22:31.490 --> 03:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative evil I think you
 
03:22:35.450 --> 03:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
served on a committee right to get rid
 
03:22:37.790 --> 03:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
of committees and commissions so you
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
have some knowledge of that yes Mr chair
 
03:22:43.250 --> 03:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
for two years I I chaired the committee
 
03:22:46.730 --> 03:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
on committees and um we reviewed every
 
03:22:50.750 --> 03:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
single statutory committee that existed
 
03:22:55.130 --> 03:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
which was many and one of we repealed
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
many but one of our great concerns was
 
03:23:00.830 --> 03:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
they'd be very clearly structured with a
 
03:23:02.809 --> 03:23:02.819 align:start position:0%
clear responsibility and a clear
 
03:23:06.550 --> 03:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
termination date and a clear reporting
 
03:23:09.410 --> 03:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
scenario to make them as worthwhile as
 
03:23:11.090 --> 03:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
they could be
 
03:23:13.130 --> 03:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hewitt did I
 
03:23:14.929 --> 03:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
03:23:19.070 --> 03:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
I I'm just confused about something uh I
 
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
know that the top of page two uh appears
 
03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:23.450 align:start position:0%
know that the top of page two uh appears
that

03:23:23.450 --> 03:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:23.460 --> 03:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:27.229 --> 03:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
I want to say 17 J5 is established the
 
03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
joint legislative parking garage
 
03:23:31.490 --> 03:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
oversight commission and then it looks
 
03:23:37.190 --> 03:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
like uh in section five uh RSA 17 J5 is
 
03:23:42.370 --> 03:23:42.380 align:start position:0%
repealed it it almost looks like to the
 
03:23:46.450 --> 03:23:46.460 align:start position:0%
uneducated that the same statute
 
03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
establishes and repeals a commission I
 
03:23:53.090 --> 03:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
can I can address that uh um it does
 
03:23:54.889 --> 03:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
look that way but if you look at the
 
03:23:56.030 --> 03:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
03:23:57.650 --> 03:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
um line four of Page Three section five
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
of this actual take effect as provided
 
03:24:02.210 --> 03:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
in section six of this act section
 
03:24:05.090 --> 03:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
section six is The Language by which
 
03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
section 5 would take effect and so
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
Section 5 only takes effect basically
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
upon me telling you the garage is done
 
03:24:13.140 --> 03:24:14.929 align:start position:0%
upon me telling you the garage is done
oh

03:24:14.929 --> 03:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:24:14.939 --> 03:24:16.429 align:start position:0%
oh
it's

03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know convoluted but it's I'm I I'm
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
told it's quite legally sound well and
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's quite ordinary for the legislature
 
03:24:32.570 --> 03:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
further questions comments of uh the
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner or general questions the
 
03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
only thing I would add is that is that
 
03:24:43.190 --> 03:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
one of the very smart Karen's in the
 
03:24:44.929 --> 03:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
room there appear to be lots of them
 
03:24:44.939 --> 03:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
room there appear to be lots of them
today

03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:24:49.130 --> 03:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
um said uh uh said to me who determines
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
which projects go before the capital
 
03:24:54.889 --> 03:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
project overview committee and I I do
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
think that it's not you know capital
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
budget overview if it's in the capital
 
03:25:01.010 --> 03:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
budget and I think that's not entirely
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
clear from this and it may there's maybe
 
03:25:06.290 --> 03:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
some in the legislature who who wonder
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
about that I think that we have other
 
03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the law you know the
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
statutes of 21i which determine what's a
 
03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
what's a project I think it's 21 I-78
 
03:25:19.010 --> 03:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
but our statutes are evolving around
 
03:25:20.990 --> 03:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
Public Works and plant and property
 
03:25:23.929 --> 03:25:23.939 align:start position:0%
which I think would cover that and I
 
03:25:25.130 --> 03:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
think it's also one of those things and
 
03:25:26.210 --> 03:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
they either Beholder of the capital
 
03:25:28.670 --> 03:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
projects committee think it's covered
 
03:25:31.370 --> 03:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
then it is covered but I just alert you
 
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
to that
 
03:25:35.570 --> 03:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I hope that the
 
03:25:37.370 --> 03:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
Commissioners proved to all of you why
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
we need him involved
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative hatch thank you just just
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh from that statement
 
03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:46.010 align:start position:0%
uh from that statement
um

03:25:46.010 --> 03:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
we often do things that involve an
 
03:25:49.849 --> 03:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of money that might be
 
03:25:52.010 --> 03:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
captured under this or may not for
 
03:25:53.990 --> 03:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
example when we did the computer system
 
03:25:55.490 --> 03:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
that was an enormous amount of money
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
that was a long-term project and
 
03:26:01.849 --> 03:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
um who has oversight over that or could
 
03:26:04.729 --> 03:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
that be captured under this it's I I
 
03:26:07.250 --> 03:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't see specific it's specific for
 
03:26:09.530 --> 03:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
each well that goes to my point this is
 
03:26:11.889 --> 03:26:11.899 align:start position:0%
specific for each type of
 
03:26:15.530 --> 03:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
the parking garage and that's it so when
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
that's done this is done
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
nice to see my former boss sitting in
 
03:26:29.929 --> 03:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
see no further questions uh we can
 
03:26:39.889 --> 03:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I would like to introduce
 
03:26:49.389 --> 03:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
2023-0384h which would
 
03:26:52.560 --> 03:26:54.229 align:start position:0%
2023-0384h which would
um

03:26:54.229 --> 03:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
create a legislative
 
03:27:00.889 --> 03:27:00.899 align:start position:0%
parking garage oversight commission as
 
03:27:04.250 --> 03:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
we've discussed and also
 
03:27:07.130 --> 03:27:07.140 align:start position:0%
replace the words budget for the capital
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
budget overview committee with the word
 
03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
project so that it does have overview or
 
03:27:16.969 --> 03:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
oversight Authority for all capital
 
03:27:19.490 --> 03:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
projects and not just those that come
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
through the capital budget
 
03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
03:27:27.830 --> 03:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and
 
03:27:30.769 --> 03:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
so I'll second this amendment
 
03:27:32.269 --> 03:27:32.279 align:start position:0%

funding source so a slight change in
 
03:28:57.229 --> 03:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
what was in the bill you know what from
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to your Amendment okay
 
03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:01.969 align:start position:0%
to speak to your Amendment okay
um

03:29:01.969 --> 03:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:06.370 --> 03:29:06.380 align:start position:0%
so the other amendment that I have uh
 
03:29:09.710 --> 03:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
changes uh
 
03:29:13.010 --> 03:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
the not just the funding source there's
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
a slight change to that but also it
 
03:29:16.020 --> 03:29:17.269 align:start position:0%
a slight change to that but also it
changes

03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
to whom the money for the parking garage
 
03:29:23.290 --> 03:29:23.300 align:start position:0%
goes the original
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill was that the
 
03:29:30.170 --> 03:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
funding for the parking garage go to the
 
03:29:33.050 --> 03:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
legislative branch and
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
um after discussing things here within
 
03:29:39.290 --> 03:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
the division and and with various other
 
03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:41.090 align:start position:0%
the division and and with various other
people

03:29:41.090 --> 03:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:29:41.100 --> 03:29:43.510 align:start position:0%
people
um

03:29:43.510 --> 03:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:46.610 --> 03:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
this proposal would direct the funding
 
03:29:48.650 --> 03:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
to go to the Department of
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
and part of the rationale is similar to
 
03:29:56.690 --> 03:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
the rationale that we had for the
 
03:30:00.349 --> 03:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
oversight commission and that is that if
 
03:30:03.290 --> 03:30:03.300 align:start position:0%
you run a capital project of this size
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars through Das there's a
 
03:30:12.769 --> 03:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
very bright line as to procedures how it
 
03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
moves forward they have staff that are
 
03:30:19.130 --> 03:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
involved with all aspects of a capital
 
03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
project of this magnitude and
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
the feeling was that to achieve the
 
03:30:30.769 --> 03:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
bright line to achieve the degree of
 
03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
transparency we would have through Das
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
and the oversight it would be better to
 
03:30:38.889 --> 03:30:38.899 align:start position:0%
put the money directly in the
 
03:30:38.899 --> 03:30:40.690 align:start position:0%
put the money directly in the
Department's

03:30:40.690 --> 03:30:40.700 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
03:30:44.570 --> 03:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
control and then the other rationale is
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
that actually Das is going to be
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for this building after it's
 
03:30:52.130 --> 03:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
constructed and so it should be as
 
03:30:55.250 --> 03:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
involved as it can be in the in the
 
03:30:55.260 --> 03:30:56.349 align:start position:0%
involved as it can be in the in the
construction

03:30:56.349 --> 03:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
construction
 
03:31:01.309 --> 03:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
the second aspect of this is that
 
03:31:04.670 --> 03:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
um it seemed appropriate since this is
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
really a a project that would benefit
 
03:31:10.610 --> 03:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch and recognizing
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we have limited general fund
 
03:31:15.290 --> 03:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
dollars and that there's 10 million
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
dollars in the legislative account that
 
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
2.5 million of the construction costs
 
03:31:23.510 --> 03:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
should come out of the legislative
 
03:31:23.520 --> 03:31:24.710 align:start position:0%
should come out of the legislative
account

03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
account
 
03:31:27.370 --> 03:31:27.380 align:start position:0%
so it would be 22.5
 
03:31:31.969 --> 03:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
General funds and 2.5 million out of the
 
03:31:33.590 --> 03:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislative account
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing I would say is
 
03:31:37.490 --> 03:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
the stairs for the lob uh they were paid
 
03:31:44.990 --> 03:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
for through the legislative account so
 
03:31:50.450 --> 03:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.490 --> 03:31:54.500 align:start position:0%
thanks for your explanation go ahead
 
03:31:56.690 --> 03:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
one other thing
 
03:32:01.130 --> 03:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
um HB 1661 which appropriated the 9.3
 
03:32:03.769 --> 03:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars for
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
um the just the all the planning for the
 
03:32:07.800 --> 03:32:09.170 align:start position:0%
um the just the all the planning for the
garage

03:32:09.170 --> 03:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
garage
 
03:32:13.250 --> 03:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and um and related issues that money
 
03:32:15.590 --> 03:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
went to das
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
so this is keeping with what that bill
 
03:32:23.929 --> 03:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
established as far as the where the
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
funding goes
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions for
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none of you prepared to offer
 
03:32:36.359 --> 03:32:38.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none of you prepared to offer
emotion

03:32:38.510 --> 03:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
emotion
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
um oh I'm sorry representative Maguire I
 
03:32:42.650 --> 03:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
had a question but not for
 
03:32:45.170 --> 03:32:45.180 align:start position:0%
representative oh
 
03:32:47.450 --> 03:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
I see Mr faff in the room so I'm
 
03:32:49.490 --> 03:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
wondering if he would like to comment on
 
03:32:52.610 --> 03:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
the two aspects of this amendment one
 
03:32:55.070 --> 03:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
moving it to administrative services and
 
03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
the other whether this account has
 
03:33:00.170 --> 03:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds for this purpose
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
my name is Terry Poff CEO for the
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
general court
 
03:33:06.530 --> 03:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I think there's sufficient funds
 
03:33:08.929 --> 03:33:08.939 align:start position:0%
available it does take a vote uh
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
generally the process is to take a vote
 
03:33:12.130 --> 03:33:12.140 align:start position:0%
from the facilities committee the
 
03:33:14.330 --> 03:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
facilities committees established to
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
oversee already the legislative
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
facilities and make sure that they're
 
03:33:21.290 --> 03:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
taken care of and and
 
03:33:22.969 --> 03:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
represent the legislature the general
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
Court's interest in those facilities so
 
03:33:26.450 --> 03:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
there are sufficient funds there we'll
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
take a vote of the committee how they
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
want to dice it up to to
 
03:33:30.479 --> 03:33:31.490 align:start position:0%
want to dice it up to to
um

03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:33.590 --> 03:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
give the money to the as it's
 
03:33:35.389 --> 03:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
statutorily going to be required to do
 
03:33:37.729 --> 03:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
but they it's an easy process there
 
03:33:39.229 --> 03:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
within the facilities committee to do
 
03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
that and as far as the Das the goal of
 
03:33:44.210 --> 03:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
the general Court's always been to get
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
that garage replaced and so whatever the
 
03:33:49.250 --> 03:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
process you come up with is fine that's
 
03:33:51.410 --> 03:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
as long as the goal gets accomplished
 
03:33:54.229 --> 03:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
currently the existing one is causing
 
03:33:55.670 --> 03:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
problems right now the netting's
 
03:33:57.410 --> 03:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
actually getting caught by tractor
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
trailers that happened again this
 
03:34:00.349 --> 03:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
morning so we have a crew right down
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
there now both gcnh personnel and Public
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
Works personnel and I believe the
 
03:34:07.969 --> 03:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
contractor trying to repair that so this
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
is an urgent situation as you all well
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
know so however we get it passed to
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
process is what we're a common goal is
 
03:34:17.570 --> 03:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
going to be achieved and with this um
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee Public Works
 
03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
involvement I'm a former member of
 
03:34:22.969 --> 03:34:22.979 align:start position:0%
Public Works when I served here Public
 
03:34:24.590 --> 03:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
Works involvement's not a bad thing it's
 
03:34:25.969 --> 03:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
a good thing so I think having
 
03:34:28.250 --> 03:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight of this
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislative facility is key so having
 
03:34:32.809 --> 03:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
that input from the legislators you
 
03:34:34.849 --> 03:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
elected legislators and any staff
 
03:34:36.290 --> 03:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
backing you might need the general court
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be the general court staff
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Terry for your comments
 
03:34:47.090 --> 03:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
nice to see you Mr chairman back there
 
03:34:47.100 --> 03:34:48.670 align:start position:0%
nice to see you Mr chairman back there
uh

03:34:48.670 --> 03:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional comments uh
 
03:34:53.330 --> 03:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
03:34:57.349 --> 03:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:59.389 --> 03:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm sorry Ms I just want
 
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
to add that I did look at the
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
legislative account and there's
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 million dollars in that
 
03:35:07.610 --> 03:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
account and it's divided there's a house
 
03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
account a senate account a joint account
 
03:35:12.769 --> 03:35:12.779 align:start position:0%
and an LBA account and then when you go
 
03:35:15.769 --> 03:35:15.779 align:start position:0%
to facilities if we do this facilities
 
03:35:17.269 --> 03:35:17.279 align:start position:0%
would decide
 
03:35:20.210 --> 03:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
out of what accounts that money would
 
03:35:20.220 --> 03:35:22.070 align:start position:0%
out of what accounts that money would
come

03:35:22.070 --> 03:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
come
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay good to have someone here that was
 
03:35:29.570 --> 03:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
on public works and facilities and yeah
 
03:35:29.580 --> 03:35:30.889 align:start position:0%
on public works and facilities and yeah
yeah okay

03:35:30.889 --> 03:35:30.899 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.389 --> 03:35:41.399 align:start position:0%
2023-0372h which would appropriate the
 
03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
money for the legislative parking garage
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the Department of administrative
 
03:35:45.600 --> 03:35:47.110 align:start position:0%
to the Department of administrative
Services

03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
22.5 million of which would be generally
 
03:35:54.170 --> 03:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
funded and 2.5 million of which would
 
03:35:56.690 --> 03:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
come from the special legislative
 
03:35:56.700 --> 03:35:59.030 align:start position:0%

amendments we have appropriate oversight
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
and the funding going to the correct
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%

03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll just take
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
we'll just take a brief five minute
 
03:39:23.750 --> 03:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
recess everyone and get
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's a little break
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
I know but we're taking a little break
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know I mean yeah it's I'm shooting
 
03:39:47.690 --> 03:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.700 --> 03:40:34.330 align:start position:0%
 
goodbye

03:40:34.330 --> 03:40:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.370 --> 04:05:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.469 --> 04:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
so we'll reconvene the work session on
 
04:05:31.490 --> 04:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 506 FNA
 
04:05:33.889 --> 04:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee heard this on
 
04:05:39.889 --> 04:05:39.899 align:start position:0%
the first I mean the 22nd of January
 
04:05:41.450 --> 04:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
and then we heard it again at a work
 
04:05:47.450 --> 04:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:49.490 --> 04:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
and with all these work sessions there's
 
04:05:51.229 --> 04:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
no requirement to have any public
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
participation but I've always been known
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
to be pretty liberal so uh
 
04:05:58.610 --> 04:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can continue that practice
 
04:06:01.090 --> 04:06:01.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for the
 
04:06:03.650 --> 04:06:03.660 align:start position:0%

04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%

representative Pearson for those of you
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%

04:06:41.090 --> 04:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to begin I was asked by the
 
04:06:45.050 --> 04:06:45.060 align:start position:0%

04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
I wish I could be there today but I was
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
unable to move my teaching schedule
 
04:07:13.729 --> 04:07:13.739 align:start position:0%
junior hockey practice and need to
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
prepare for tonight's council meeting
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
for the second time I need to clarify
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the council's position regarding our
 
04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
last vote but first the history prior to
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
the council voting on The Rail Trail
 
04:07:27.889 --> 04:07:27.899 align:start position:0%
tunnel I called for a meeting with our
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
town manager Vice chair representative
 
04:07:34.250 --> 04:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
Pearson and members of The Dot
 
04:07:37.250 --> 04:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
I asked the dot two main questions one
 
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
if the council decided to vote for the
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
tunnel would Dairy be on the hook
 
04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
and two if the council decided to vote
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
for the tunnel would there be delays and
 
04:07:47.330 --> 04:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
how long
 
04:07:49.610 --> 04:07:49.620 align:start position:0%
we were assured by the D.O.T that we
 
04:07:51.170 --> 04:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
would not be on the hook for additional
 
04:07:54.050 --> 04:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
spending if we voted for the tunnel and
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
could expect six months to one year of
 
04:07:55.800 --> 04:07:57.349 align:start position:0%
could expect six months to one year of
delays

04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
delays
 
04:08:00.110 --> 04:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
have you have you asked the dot if the
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
above is true question mark
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
so with this info I put this on the
 
04:08:07.370 --> 04:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
agenda to be decided one month later at
 
04:08:08.809 --> 04:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
our next council meeting there was a
 
04:08:10.429 --> 04:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
large number of local and non-local
 
04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
residents applying pressure to the
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
council and advocating for the tunnel a
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:22.370 --> 04:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
before our vote slash our vote
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
this is I'm sorry I'm reading what he
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
wrote me a few days before
 
04:08:30.170 --> 04:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
our vote slash meeting the dot reversed
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
their decision and said we could be on
 
04:08:34.250 --> 04:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
the hook financially if we decided that
 
04:08:36.530 --> 04:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
we wanted the tunnel what a giant waste
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
of time I would have never put this on
 
04:08:41.090 --> 04:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
the agenda if we knew we might be on the
 
04:08:43.309 --> 04:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
hook I asked the dot at least three
 
04:08:46.370 --> 04:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
times three different ways if we could
 
04:08:48.889 --> 04:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
be on the hook and was assured no
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
I worked closely with our town manager
 
04:08:52.610 --> 04:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
on the crafting of the motion that we
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
I wanted it to send the message that the
 
04:08:57.769 --> 04:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
council was putting this back in the
 
04:08:59.689 --> 04:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
state's hands and that we were not
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
supporting spending additional money on
 
04:09:04.130 --> 04:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
the rail trail
 
04:09:06.650 --> 04:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
the dot should not use this vote to
 
04:09:08.570 --> 04:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
justify its position
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
we were robbed of our vote on whether we
 
04:09:13.370 --> 04:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
supported the tunnel or not that is the
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
most frustrating part of all of this
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
I implore you to do your due diligence
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
and call each counselor and ask them
 
04:09:20.809 --> 04:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
what they thought they were voting on
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to bet that they voted not
 
04:09:24.889 --> 04:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
to spend a dime more and that each and
 
04:09:26.210 --> 04:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
every one of them
 
04:09:27.889 --> 04:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:09:30.050 --> 04:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
do not tie this to whether or not we
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
support the tunnel
 
04:09:33.530 --> 04:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying how that vote would have
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
gone but only that you know that the
 
04:09:37.969 --> 04:09:37.979 align:start position:0%
vote meant what the vote meant to us and
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
that due to the Dot's flip-flop we did
 
04:09:42.650 --> 04:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
not vote in support or against the
 
04:09:42.660 --> 04:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
not vote in support or against the
tunnel

04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
tunnel
 
04:09:46.729 --> 04:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
and I'll read that line again I'm not
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
saying how that vote would have gone but
 
04:09:51.410 --> 04:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
only that only that you know what the
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
and that due to the Dot's flip-flop we
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
did not vote in support or against the
 
04:10:02.450 --> 04:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
tunnel please call me if you would like
 
04:10:04.610 --> 04:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
any information of any member of the
 
04:10:06.110 --> 04:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
Derry Town Council I would be happy to
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
provide it sign Josh Borden with his
 
04:10:10.020 --> 04:10:10.030 align:start position:0%
phone number included
 
04:10:10.030 --> 04:10:12.110 align:start position:0%
phone number included
[Music]

04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.610 --> 04:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
now for my disclosure so I sit on
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration and we have
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
the Monumental task of dealing with the
 
04:10:25.550 --> 04:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
ethics rules of the house
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
so in the spirit of that even though I'm
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
not required to I will disclose that I
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
am a member of the dairy uh
 
04:10:37.130 --> 04:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
rail trail board the board owns Mill
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
real property it has no taxing Authority
 
04:10:44.150 --> 04:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
it makes no rules and only exists at the
 
04:10:46.670 --> 04:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
grace of the town to probably primarily
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
pick up garbage and pull weeds that is
 
04:10:52.250 --> 04:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
that board
 
04:10:52.260 --> 04:10:53.929 align:start position:0%
that board
so

04:10:53.929 --> 04:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
in reference to Chairman Borden's letter
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
um he references is a meeting a meeting
 
04:11:00.710 --> 04:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
that I was at
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I want to reiterate the fact that
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
his words are true three separate
 
04:11:07.250 --> 04:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
occasions bluntly asked
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
if the dairy was on the hook for
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
anything and the answer was always no
 
04:11:14.990 --> 04:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
so imagine my surprise in the surprise
 
04:11:16.610 --> 04:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
of the chairman and vice chairman of the
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
council when they received that
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
threatening letter from the chairman or
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me the the commissioner of the
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
indicating what you which I believe you
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.570 --> 04:11:37.580 align:start position:0%
and if you don't it's a letter of
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
November 28th it's a letter dated note
 
04:11:43.370 --> 04:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
December 14th I believe okay probably
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
it's in the package
 
04:12:04.610 --> 04:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:12.530 --> 04:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
we're also going to provide you a copy
 
04:12:14.510 --> 04:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
that contract that was you requested at
 
04:12:17.570 --> 04:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
this is on file with Secretary of
 
04:12:20.929 --> 04:12:20.939 align:start position:0%
State's office
 
04:12:26.689 --> 04:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.610 --> 04:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
so as discussed in this this contract
 
04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
um it it to surmise we we mentioned it
 
04:12:35.030 --> 04:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the other work session that basically
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
it says each of the towns are required
 
04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:25.500 --> 04:13:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:13:43.250 --> 04:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.790 --> 04:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
but we have the benefit of the law
 
04:13:50.809 --> 04:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
offices of Wilmer Hale his
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the contract at our at
 
04:13:56.450 --> 04:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
the request of
 
04:13:56.460 --> 04:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
the request of
um

04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:59.450 --> 04:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
the rail trail Organization for them to
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
look over this contract to make sure
 
04:14:03.469 --> 04:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
that when
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
the contract was discussed and addressed
 
04:14:07.490 --> 04:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
that they were speaking properly and and
 
04:14:07.500 --> 04:14:10.309 align:start position:0%
that they were speaking properly and and
correctly

04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
so I'll start with the the first thing
 
04:14:16.729 --> 04:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.849 --> 04:14:19.859 align:start position:0%
in the second bullet point down given
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
the reconsideration at this point in the
 
04:14:24.889 --> 04:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
design there is a school of thought that
 
04:14:27.290 --> 04:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
the town should bear responsibility for
 
04:14:29.450 --> 04:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
additional costs
 
04:14:32.469 --> 04:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's not a coincident that that was sent
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
right before the Town Council is going
 
04:14:40.370 --> 04:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.349 --> 04:14:42.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's proper for the
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
estate agency to attempt to manipulate a
 
04:14:47.389 --> 04:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
local Town Council that way
 
04:14:51.290 --> 04:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
but please don't be lost in the timing
 
04:14:54.530 --> 04:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:14:56.809 --> 04:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
because it seems clear to me that that
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
was that intention of sending that email
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
the law offices of Wilmer Hale in Boston
 
04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
are a massive outfit they have offices
 
04:15:12.170 --> 04:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
all over the globe
 
04:15:15.530 --> 04:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
in the U.S and in Europe
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
and they looked it over and they came up
 
04:15:20.689 --> 04:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
and not going to read it to you but they
 
04:15:22.969 --> 04:15:22.979 align:start position:0%
came up with two points first that
 
04:15:24.650 --> 04:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
there's no legal basis on which the
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation could
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
require the town of Derry to contribute
 
04:15:30.769 --> 04:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
additional funds to the project even if
 
04:15:32.510 --> 04:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Town Council votes to support the
 
04:15:34.969 --> 04:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
planned tunnel under Folsom Road in the
 
04:15:36.290 --> 04:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Lawrence railroad
 
04:15:38.870 --> 04:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
historic district the town's 2015
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
agreement with the D.O.T unambiguously
 
04:15:42.110 --> 04:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
limits the town's financial
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the project to 5
 
04:15:44.220 --> 04:15:45.590 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the project to 5
million

04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:15:48.530 --> 04:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
the second point they brought up
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
was removing the tunnel from the project
 
04:15:54.769 --> 04:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
would delay not expedite this project as
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
we've discussed before that tunnel was
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
part of the planned submission that was
 
04:16:00.349 --> 04:16:00.359 align:start position:0%
federally approved
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:16:04.490 --> 04:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
a supplemental environmental impact
 
04:16:06.050 --> 04:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
statement would be required for new
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
federal approval for the project if the
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
tunnel is removed and preparing the
 
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
supplemental Eis would take at least
 
04:16:12.530 --> 04:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
several months
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
and they go on to get into specifics but
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
that is the gist of the the opinion of
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
the law offices of Wilmer Hale which has
 
04:16:27.290 --> 04:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
when the town entered into this contract
 
04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
we we had to float a bond is five
 
04:16:33.889 --> 04:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
million dollars the town of dairy is not
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
of size where we can simply just take
 
04:16:39.170 --> 04:16:39.180 align:start position:0%
five million dollars and and spend it
 
04:16:40.490 --> 04:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:16:44.269 --> 04:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
so the the people of my community
 
04:16:48.050 --> 04:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
consented to to pay the 5 million they
 
04:16:49.969 --> 04:16:49.979 align:start position:0%
voted for the bond we we floated it and
 
04:16:51.170 --> 04:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
paid it
 
04:16:53.150 --> 04:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
so for the Department of Transportation
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
to send
 
04:16:57.650 --> 04:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
an email stating
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
that now the town could be on the hook
 
04:17:01.250 --> 04:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
for other elements
 
04:17:03.650 --> 04:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
the people of the town of Derry did not
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
vote to do that they did not consent to
 
04:17:06.239 --> 04:17:07.910 align:start position:0%
vote to do that they did not consent to
that

04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:09.889 --> 04:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
they consented to paying the five
 
04:17:11.389 --> 04:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars and appearing to the
 
04:17:11.399 --> 04:17:15.349 align:start position:0%
million dollars and appearing to the
contract

04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
if it's not going to be the position of
 
04:17:24.050 --> 04:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation that
 
04:17:26.150 --> 04:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry
 
04:17:28.790 --> 04:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
has paid what they are required and
 
04:17:30.110 --> 04:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be asked for more
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
outside the parameters of this contract
 
04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
then I think we have a substantially
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
bigger problem in the fact that my
 
04:17:42.170 --> 04:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
and without that consent because of the
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
involvement of so much local Road
 
04:17:49.689 --> 04:17:49.699 align:start position:0%
this project should stop immediately
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:00.950 --> 04:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
the elements specific to other aspects
 
04:18:02.210 --> 04:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
of this I'll let the folks that are
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
experts behind me touch on
 
04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in rail trails
 
04:18:07.560 --> 04:18:09.849 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in rail trails
but

04:18:09.849 --> 04:18:09.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
my job as a state representative is to
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
protect my constituents
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
and convey messages from my local
 
04:18:22.490 --> 04:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
officials and that is what I've done for
 
04:18:24.710 --> 04:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
you here now so
 
04:18:26.330 --> 04:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
if there's any additional questions to
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
this I'm more than happy to take them
 
04:18:27.720 --> 04:18:29.030 align:start position:0%
this I'm more than happy to take them
and

04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:32.689 --> 04:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
we can go on to some other elements
 
04:18:36.290 --> 04:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Pearson
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
04:18:42.590 --> 04:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
being here the 2015 contract without
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
reading it through fully
 
04:18:46.910 --> 04:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
um did it outline which route was going
 
04:18:49.010 --> 04:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
to be utilized for the rail trail
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
no the contract doesn't indicate the
 
04:18:53.450 --> 04:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
route for the rail trail it also doesn't
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
indicate the route for the road either
 
04:18:58.490 --> 04:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
it indicates the project thank you Mr
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so it
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
references the project anywhere in here
 
04:19:04.849 --> 04:19:04.859 align:start position:0%
does it say that the town of dairies
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
Town Council can vote to alter the plan
 
04:19:09.889 --> 04:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
change the plan approve the project
 
04:19:11.929 --> 04:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
before or does it still relegate all
 
04:19:13.550 --> 04:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
that responsibility to the State
 
04:19:16.490 --> 04:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation there are
 
04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
elements in here that involve the
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
cooperation between the towns and the
 
04:19:20.640 --> 04:19:22.130 align:start position:0%
cooperation between the towns and the
state

04:19:22.130 --> 04:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:19:25.969 --> 04:19:25.979 align:start position:0%
um as far as the specifics to the back
 
04:19:27.530 --> 04:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
and forth of that the Department of
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
Transportation has had many many
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
meetings with local officials for years
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
in reference to this
 
04:19:34.560 --> 04:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
in reference to this
so

04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:36.000 --> 04:19:37.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:19:37.370 --> 04:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
how that's outlined in here I'd have to
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
read through and really dissect that as
 
04:19:44.689 --> 04:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
far as the specifics but from the
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
practical application there has been a
 
04:19:49.010 --> 04:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
relationship back and forth going back
 
04:19:51.769 --> 04:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
into the 80s really into when the
 
04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
precipice of this concept became a thing
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
so I I would just call that if if it's
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
not spelled out here it's long
 
04:20:00.170 --> 04:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
established practice
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
one more question thank you chairman
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again sure so again I I'm
 
04:20:06.889 --> 04:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
aware this has been going on for years
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
at what stage in the process whether
 
04:20:11.689 --> 04:20:11.699 align:start position:0%
that be a date or a general time period
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
did the route that the dot was pursuing
 
04:20:14.760 --> 04:20:17.269 align:start position:0%
did the route that the dot was pursuing
become

04:20:17.269 --> 04:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:20:20.530 --> 04:20:20.540 align:start position:0%
contentious for the residents
 
04:20:25.969 --> 04:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
this is a federal approval yes okay so
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
the the plan that was brought before us
 
04:20:32.330 --> 04:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Keith Cota who was the project
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
manager at the time a fellow that I
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on the phone with
 
04:20:36.720 --> 04:20:37.570 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on the phone with
um

04:20:37.570 --> 04:20:37.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:40.729 --> 04:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
they submitted this to Federal Highway
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is approved by the fed's dated
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
February 3rd of 2020 the Federal Highway
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
approval will have the original design
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
had the Box tunnel in it that's that's
 
04:20:54.229 --> 04:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
what was federally approved
 
04:20:56.150 --> 04:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
and this is uh you'll receive a copy of
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
the approval from the feds
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
so at some point after the bid build
 
04:21:06.189 --> 04:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
process was abandoned
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
a one of the engineering firms submitted
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
a design that was outside the scope of
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
that of what was asked
 
04:21:21.290 --> 04:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Transportation
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
took that when the when that process
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
ended they received all of the paperwork
 
04:21:27.170 --> 04:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
and the documents and all the stuff from
 
04:21:28.969 --> 04:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
those bidding contractors
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
and at some point they decided to start
 
04:21:32.210 --> 04:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
down that road
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
we didn't know about it until we had two
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
public hearings at the middle school
 
04:21:41.450 --> 04:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
um both of which had maps on the wall
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
that contained the tunnel
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
and the first public hearing
 
04:21:50.570 --> 04:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of dairy to outline
 
04:21:54.290 --> 04:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
this was in September of last year
 
04:21:57.130 --> 04:21:57.140 align:start position:0%
which is way late in the process
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
substantially into the time period where
 
04:22:01.010 --> 04:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
they knew that they were going they were
 
04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
looking at a change
 
04:22:02.640 --> 04:22:06.290 align:start position:0%
looking at a change
and

04:22:06.290 --> 04:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.610 --> 04:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
really as we were told too late
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
so a public hearing that's supposed to
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
be getting input from the citizens of my
 
04:22:17.150 --> 04:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
town really was more of a dictation than
 
04:22:19.429 --> 04:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
it was a was an input session
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
they should have called for a public
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hearing Way sooner when they knew there
 
04:22:24.530 --> 04:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
was a change that was going to be made
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
and we this was a blind side to local
 
04:22:32.929 --> 04:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then that started the ball rolling
 
04:22:37.010 --> 04:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
with the various the various affected
 
04:22:38.750 --> 04:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
groups and and townsfolks that were
 
04:22:41.210 --> 04:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
saying what is this so
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
um representative O'Brien was probably
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
the first one really to to recognize
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
this and and kind of say hey what's
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
going on here so
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
this is this is well after the fed's
 
04:22:53.520 --> 04:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
this is this is well after the fed's
approved

04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
approved
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
seeing now and I do we have one
 
04:23:09.650 --> 04:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
were you ever given a reason why the
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
department didn't hold it public hearing
 
04:23:14.330 --> 04:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
after changes were made to the tunnel
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
plan or
 
04:23:19.370 --> 04:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
I don't recall ever asking them that so
 
04:23:19.380 --> 04:23:20.809 align:start position:0%
I don't recall ever asking them that so
I

04:23:20.809 --> 04:23:20.819 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I know that we had we had
 
04:23:24.290 --> 04:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
attempted to do it in August and there
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
was an air conditioning issue with the
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
middle school but that's a month so it's
 
04:23:29.809 --> 04:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
not really one month is really not in
 
04:23:30.889 --> 04:23:30.899 align:start position:0%
question here
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
um but no I don't I don't know I don't
 
04:23:35.450 --> 04:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
have an answer why they didn't
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
stay around
 
04:23:44.330 --> 04:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
thanks for your I will thank you sir
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
I do see another sponsor here
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh and I go by prude
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
home O'Brien so I'm not confused with
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Michael O'Brien of Nashua
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want that to happen I hope it
 
04:24:05.760 --> 04:24:07.309 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want that to happen I hope it
wouldn't

04:24:07.309 --> 04:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
that would really
 
04:24:10.490 --> 04:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
really okay for me
 
04:24:10.500 --> 04:24:11.150 align:start position:0%
really okay for me
um

04:24:11.150 --> 04:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
anyway uh
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
I want to answer some of the questions
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
that just came up the first time I saw
 
04:24:22.130 --> 04:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
the convoluted spaghettified more
 
04:24:24.530 --> 04:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
complicated passageway I remember the
 
04:24:30.170 --> 04:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
day it was October 28 2021 and the plans
 
04:24:32.929 --> 04:24:32.939 align:start position:0%
were unveiled to the community at a
 
04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
meeting at the municipal center it was
 
04:24:37.969 --> 04:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
packed I could barely get around the
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
room and I remember this because I went
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
directly to the plans to look at the
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
rail trail Crossing and I had a very
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
strong reaction when I saw that and I
 
04:24:52.010 --> 04:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
started asking the man who was standing
 
04:24:54.710 --> 04:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
next to the plans who's an engineer
 
04:24:56.389 --> 04:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
questions about it and he couldn't
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
answer my questions and sent me over to
 
04:25:01.370 --> 04:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
some other Engineers on the project who
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
told me that the reason why they wanted
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
to do it was to save money because they
 
04:25:08.809 --> 04:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
would save about seven hundred and
 
04:25:11.210 --> 04:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
seventy thousand dollars because since
 
04:25:13.969 --> 04:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
they already have to pass over Shield
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
Brook why not just have a passing there
 
04:25:19.969 --> 04:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
we had no idea and I'm saying and we the
 
04:25:22.610 --> 04:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
community had no idea that this was an
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
option and I've mentioned last time this
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
would have been outside of the realm of
 
04:25:31.250 --> 04:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
my imagination and I went and spoke to
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
those other engineers and then I sat
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
down next to Tom card in a former Town
 
04:25:38.450 --> 04:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
counselor who is here and basically had
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
a conversation that was akin to what
 
04:25:43.729 --> 04:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
intonation because
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
I could like I said I couldn't have
 
04:25:47.809 --> 04:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
imagined it and it seems very complex
 
04:25:50.330 --> 04:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
and since then I have been making many
 
04:25:52.969 --> 04:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
many phone calls about this uh to
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation of
 
04:25:54.840 --> 04:25:56.450 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation of
officials

04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:25:58.610 --> 04:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
um safety and officials with the
 
04:26:00.410 --> 04:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation the last
 
04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with the Department
 
04:26:04.490 --> 04:26:04.500 align:start position:0%
of Transportation official
 
04:26:06.769 --> 04:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
because the gist of every single one of
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
my conversations was what do we do next
 
04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
how do we communicate to the Department
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
of Transportation that this is not the
 
04:26:18.590 --> 04:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
best choice and that's what my
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
constituents have consistently been
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
telling me they're not happy with this
 
04:26:25.550 --> 04:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
passageway that is the spaghettified
 
04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
complex that has many navals labels
 
04:26:31.250 --> 04:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
and what I was told last was the Town
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
Council needs to weigh in we need to
 
04:26:35.809 --> 04:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
hear from the Town Council well
 
04:26:38.510 --> 04:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
reading this letter it seems to me like
 
04:26:40.490 --> 04:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
the you know the thumb was on the scale
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
and and listening to the Town Council
 
04:26:46.849 --> 04:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.250 --> 04:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony and spending
 
04:26:50.929 --> 04:26:50.939 align:start position:0%
the time with me and representative
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
wheeler out there last Thursday yeah
 
04:26:54.649 --> 04:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
04:26:54.659 --> 04:26:56.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
um

04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:59.149 --> 04:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
you said something that
 
04:27:01.090 --> 04:27:01.100 align:start position:0%
caught my attention
 
04:27:04.490 --> 04:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
they've proposed a 63-foot bridge
 
04:27:06.410 --> 04:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
according to the letter I have that was
 
04:27:08.870 --> 04:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
sent out on November 28th by the
 
04:27:11.330 --> 04:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office do you know and
 
04:27:14.269 --> 04:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's where the scenic spaghetti Trail
 
04:27:17.450 --> 04:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
goes do you know if they had a 63-foot
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
bridge initially in the plan because to
 
04:27:21.410 --> 04:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
me that seems like
 
04:27:24.110 --> 04:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
a rather expensive fix for that existing
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
60 inch culvert
 
04:27:29.630 --> 04:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure I have observed
 
04:27:31.969 --> 04:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
Bridges being reconstructed in my
 
04:27:33.530 --> 04:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
community such as on fordway extension
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I know that the thinking now is to
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
go much wider to accommodate for any
 
04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
potential flooding in that is an area
 
04:27:41.210 --> 04:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
where there has been flooding so that is
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
a concern
 
04:27:42.960 --> 04:27:44.030 align:start position:0%
a concern
um

04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:46.849 --> 04:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of concerns with that
 
04:27:51.530 --> 04:27:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm I've expressed
 
04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
um everything I've I can think of right
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
at this moment but I wanted to I wanted
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
to make make clear to you that when I
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
first began to ask about this that day
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
October 28 2021
 
04:28:03.239 --> 04:28:04.309 align:start position:0%
October 28 2021
um

04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:07.130 --> 04:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
that I was told it was to save money and
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
I was pretty surprised by the I was
 
04:28:10.969 --> 04:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
pretty shocked really this whole thing
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
again thanks for your testimony are
 
04:28:19.370 --> 04:28:19.380 align:start position:0%

04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%

04:28:23.710 --> 04:28:23.720 align:start position:0%

Londonderry project
[Music]

04:29:14.349 --> 04:29:14.359 align:start position:0%

04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
um the Department's position on this
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
issue I do want to preface by saying
 
04:29:29.090 --> 04:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
there have been some significant
 
04:29:31.969 --> 04:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
allegations made throughout different
 
04:29:35.330 --> 04:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
testimonies from other people my intent
 
04:29:40.490 --> 04:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
is not to get into a back and forth on
 
04:29:43.849 --> 04:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
allegations and and other things I
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that your other
 
04:29:48.110 --> 04:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
hearings you talked about the
 
04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor portions of the law of the
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
bill and I have confidence that those
 
04:29:55.550 --> 04:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
will be removed but I'd like to go ahead
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
with my testimony
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation
 
04:30:02.750 --> 04:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
supports the scenic route adjacent to
 
04:30:05.450 --> 04:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook and does not support the
 
04:30:08.450 --> 04:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
tunnel the primary reasons that the
 
04:30:10.610 --> 04:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
department does not support the tunnel
 
04:30:15.290 --> 04:30:15.300 align:start position:0%
is a delay in connecting exit 4A with
 
04:30:19.010 --> 04:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
Folsom Road the increase in design and
 
04:30:21.889 --> 04:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
construction cost in the increased
 
04:30:25.250 --> 04:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
long-term maintenance costs for the town
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
of Derry
 
04:30:29.630 --> 04:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
a number of points I'd like to be clear
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
on the department has worked with the
 
04:30:35.870 --> 04:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
towns of dairy in Londonderry throughout
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
the design of the overall exit for a
 
04:30:38.640 --> 04:30:39.710 align:start position:0%
the design of the overall exit for a
project

04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy continues to support
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
the Department's proposed Scenic Trail
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
alignment adjacent to Shields Brook and
 
04:30:53.030 --> 04:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think you have a memo from Dave Karen
 
04:30:55.070 --> 04:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
the town manager or the Town
 
04:30:58.250 --> 04:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
Administrator for the town of dairy
 
04:31:01.729 --> 04:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
the scenic not not to interrupt but you
 
04:31:03.649 --> 04:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
probably just heard that we have a
 
04:31:06.490 --> 04:31:06.500 align:start position:0%
letter from the president of the council
 
04:31:09.469 --> 04:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
conf the conflicting information that's
 
04:31:11.090 --> 04:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
what we're wrestling with because I
 
04:31:13.729 --> 04:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
agree with you that we'd like to move on
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
get a resolution of this none of us are
 
04:31:18.649 --> 04:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
going getting anywhere quickly by
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
pointing fingers one way the other but
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
we need to get a resolution because
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
again we're hearing conflicting reports
 
04:31:28.370 --> 04:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
emails letters from the town just today
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't heard before from the
 
04:31:32.929 --> 04:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
council president so
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and can continue but I think we just
 
04:31:37.610 --> 04:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
we need to get to a solution here
 
04:31:39.530 --> 04:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
because I think both sides are probably
 
04:31:39.540 --> 04:31:40.490 align:start position:0%
because I think both sides are probably
in

04:31:40.490 --> 04:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
um agreement that they're not happy with
 
04:31:45.050 --> 04:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
the situation so hopefully we can get to
 
04:31:47.809 --> 04:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
a a good point a
 
04:31:50.990 --> 04:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
and and I'm confident that that we can
 
04:31:54.290 --> 04:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm confident that that we can
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
so the again the we've worked with the
 
04:31:59.870 --> 04:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
towns of dairy and Londonderry the
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
Scenic Trail alignment adjacent to
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook wilmie ADA requirements
 
04:32:10.510 --> 04:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Scenic Trail alignment will be safe
 
04:32:13.550 --> 04:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
independent of the tunnel or Scenic
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
Trail alignment a crosswalk will be
 
04:32:19.370 --> 04:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
installed on Folsom Road at the
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
intersection with North High Street to
 
04:32:25.370 --> 04:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
connect pedestrians using the sidewalks
 
04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
on those roads
 
04:32:30.889 --> 04:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
changing to a tunnel will cost more
 
04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
money to design construct and maintain
 
04:32:37.849 --> 04:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
and redesign for the Box Culvert will
 
04:32:41.090 --> 04:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
delay the opening of Old Rum Trail and
 
04:32:44.330 --> 04:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
Folsom Road from I-93 to New Hampshire
 
04:32:48.050 --> 04:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
route 102. those are the basic premises
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
for the Department's position and I'll
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
go through and flesh each one out a
 
04:32:54.170 --> 04:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
so the department has worked with the
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
towns of dairy and Londonderry
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the design of the overall
 
04:33:03.530 --> 04:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
exit for a project the town of Derry
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
continues to support the Department's
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
proposed Scenic Trail alignment adjacent
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
to Shields Brook when I say that I'm
 
04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy and Londonderry have
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
worked for over 40 years to progress the
 
04:33:26.631 --> 04:33:26.641 align:start position:0%
exit for a project to support Economic
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
Opportunity and to reduce traffic
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
congestion in downtown Dairy on December
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
23rd 2015 the department entered into a
 
04:33:41.029 --> 04:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
state local project agreement with Derry
 
04:33:45.170 --> 04:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
in Londonderry for the I-93 exit 4A
 
04:33:48.709 --> 04:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
project the agreement in the addition of
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
the dairy Londonderry project into the
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
state's 10-year Transportation
 
04:33:56.349 --> 04:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan provided local funding
 
04:33:59.810 --> 04:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
and federal funding in the process for
 
04:34:03.470 --> 04:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:06.769 --> 04:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
as well as a process for the design and
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
construction of the project
 
04:34:12.529 --> 04:34:12.539 align:start position:0%
the department has and continues to
 
04:34:15.230 --> 04:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
follow the project agreement in the
 
04:34:17.990 --> 04:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
process which includes public meetings
 
04:34:19.730 --> 04:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
and input
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
the department prepared and advertised a
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
design build procurement for design and
 
04:34:28.310 --> 04:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
construction of the project the
 
04:34:31.609 --> 04:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
procurement was prohibitively expensive
 
04:34:34.429 --> 04:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
one of the design teams that bid on the
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
design build procurement had developed a
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
concept that had both the town of dairy
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
in the dairy rail trail board support to
 
04:34:47.330 --> 04:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
provide an open light and scenic route
 
04:34:49.730 --> 04:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
for the trail under the shields Brook
 
04:34:53.330 --> 04:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
Bridge with documented cost savings
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
other benefits and support for the
 
04:34:58.730 --> 04:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
design the department included this
 
04:35:01.609 --> 04:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
element in the final design of the
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
overall 2.3 mile roadway connecting the
 
04:35:09.529 --> 04:35:09.539 align:start position:0%
new I-93 exit 4A to New Hampshire route
 
04:35:09.539 --> 04:35:11.150 align:start position:0%
new I-93 exit 4A to New Hampshire route
102.

04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
102.
 
04:35:14.449 --> 04:35:14.459 align:start position:0%
the department is and always has been
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
committed to providing connectivity of
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
the rail trail under Folsom road while
 
04:35:23.209 --> 04:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
the tunnel in the Scenic Trail under
 
04:35:26.750 --> 04:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook both have advantages and
 
04:35:29.090 --> 04:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
disadvantages the department is
 
04:35:32.689 --> 04:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
confident that both designs are safe and
 
04:35:34.970 --> 04:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
will meet the long-term needs of all
 
04:35:37.131 --> 04:35:37.141 align:start position:0%
Trail users
 
04:35:40.010 --> 04:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
since the Scenic Trail route adjacent to
 
04:35:42.890 --> 04:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
Shield Brooks concept has been selected
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
the department had a public meeting on

October 28 2021
 
04:35:53.570 --> 04:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
the department met separately with the
 
04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
rail trail groups on August 23rd 2022 in
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%

04:36:12.830 --> 04:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
the department looks to the town as the
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
local decision maker and they have been
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
consistent with us that they do not want

delay
 
04:36:26.330 --> 04:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
change in the current design will lead
 
04:36:30.890 --> 04:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
to increased cost and additional delays
 
04:36:33.890 --> 04:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
the trail alignment adjacent to Shields
 
04:36:37.551 --> 04:36:37.561 align:start position:0%
Brook wilmie ADA requirements the Scenic
 
04:36:39.890 --> 04:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
Trail design adjacent to Shields Brook
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
will meet all the requirements of the

to avoid any section of the rail trail
 
04:36:52.910 --> 04:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
from being too steep the trail is
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
lengthened slightly to manage a profile
 
04:36:57.490 --> 04:36:57.500 align:start position:0%
slope of the path
 
04:37:00.529 --> 04:37:00.539 align:start position:0%
installation of the other option a
 
04:37:03.709 --> 04:37:03.719 align:start position:0%
tunnel will actually alter the profile
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
slope of Folsom Road such as the profile
 
04:37:10.250 --> 04:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
of the road and the sidewalks along it
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
will likely exceed that of the rail
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
trail we expect Folsom Road height will
 
04:37:20.330 --> 04:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
increase between five and seven feet and
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
not the profile slope of the road will
 
04:37:25.609 --> 04:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
increase to somewhere between five and
 
04:37:28.131 --> 04:37:28.141 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
04:37:31.849 --> 04:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
the trail alignment will be safe within
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the project limits the trail will cross
 
04:37:37.849 --> 04:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
ferwin drive a short Dead End Street and
 
04:37:40.449 --> 04:37:40.459 align:start position:0%
we'll cross two additional driveways
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
intersecting with Folsom road with
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
either design the trail will cross
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
driveways along North High Street within
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
the project limits these Crossings do
 
04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
not make the trail unsafe
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
further south in Dairy the trail runs
 
04:38:00.010 --> 04:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
concurrently with Courthouse Lane
 
04:38:03.170 --> 04:38:03.180 align:start position:0%

04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
independent of the trail alignment a
 
04:38:19.490 --> 04:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
crosswalk will be installed on Folsom
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%

North High Street and Manchester Road
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
the signalized intersections along the
 
04:38:45.769 --> 04:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
corridor will have pedestrian Crossings
 
04:38:48.650 --> 04:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
providing pedestrian safe passage
 
04:38:51.650 --> 04:38:51.660 align:start position:0%
regardless of the trail alignment
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
similar six-lane crosswalks currently

Road in Manchester Road
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
changing to a tunnel will cost more
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
money to design construct and maintain
 
04:39:13.010 --> 04:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
final design of the project has
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
progressed with the trail adjacent to
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook a change in design at this
 
04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
point will require the department to
 
04:39:24.529 --> 04:39:24.539 align:start position:0%
negotiate an increase scope and fee with
 
04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
our design consultant increasing the
 
04:39:30.410 --> 04:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
cost of the design the tunnel is
 
04:39:34.010 --> 04:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
estimated to add more than 770
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
000 to the cost of construction this
 
04:39:40.130 --> 04:39:40.140 align:start position:0%
estimate includes subtracting the
 
04:39:42.410 --> 04:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
savings from not building the Scenic
 
04:39:44.630 --> 04:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
Trail under the bridge
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
there will also be additional costs for
 
04:39:50.330 --> 04:39:50.340 align:start position:0%
engineering estimated to be about a
 
04:39:52.850 --> 04:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
hundred and twelve thousand dollars the
 
04:39:54.948 --> 04:39:54.958 align:start position:0%
cost may rise as the final design
 
04:39:58.368 --> 04:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
progresses finally if a tunnel is
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
installed the town of dairy will bear
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
the future cost of Maintenance the dairy
 
04:40:06.530 --> 04:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator referring to the
 
04:40:09.530 --> 04:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
trail adjacent to seal Shields Brook has
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
publicly stated on a long-term
 
04:40:15.050 --> 04:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance basis it's about a third of
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
the cost to maintain the trail meaning
 
04:40:20.530 --> 04:40:20.540 align:start position:0%
under Shields Brook
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
redesigned for the box cover will delay
 
04:40:27.050 --> 04:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
the opening of Old Rum Trail in Folsom
 
04:40:30.050 --> 04:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
Road from I-93 to New Hampshire route
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
102. the department is aware that this
 
04:40:35.810 --> 04:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
committee has received a letter from the
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
town of Derry with background
 
04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
information and action taken by the
 
04:40:44.090 --> 04:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
dairy Town Council we believe the letter
 
04:40:47.330 --> 04:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
is a fair description of the process the
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
town has made it very clear to us they
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
do not want any delay and they do not
 
04:40:55.730 --> 04:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
want cost increases the department
 
04:40:58.250 --> 04:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
currently has a town of dairy support
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
for the trail adjacent to Shields Brook
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
and does not intend to change a design
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
causing additional delay and increased
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
cost should a law be passed to require a
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
tunnel the department will be forced to
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
to take the following steps we'll
 
04:41:18.770 --> 04:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
discuss with the town of dairy the
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
requirement any law may be imposing on
 
04:41:23.708 --> 04:41:23.718 align:start position:0%
the roadway that the town will own
 
04:41:27.288 --> 04:41:27.298 align:start position:0%
operate maintain to determine how best
 
04:41:30.770 --> 04:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
to comply with any law passed we'll
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate a scope and fee with our
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
design consultant to incorporate the
 
04:41:38.090 --> 04:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
design change we'll seek Federal Highway
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
approval of that scope and fee we'll
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
seek their approval for an updated
 
04:41:45.550 --> 04:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
estimate approving the change in cost
 
04:41:48.170 --> 04:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
will request governor and Council
 
04:41:51.050 --> 04:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
approval for the scope and fee with our
 
04:41:53.810 --> 04:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
design consultant we'll issue a notice
 
04:41:56.810 --> 04:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
to proceed complete new geotechnical
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
work for the tunnel option design review
 
04:42:02.690 --> 04:42:02.700 align:start position:0%
and approve changes in line and grade
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
will design review and approve slope and
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
drain we'll have new utilities
 
04:42:10.128 --> 04:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
submissions in review
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
will draft environmental permits and
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
Wetland plans for review and approval by
 
04:42:18.410 --> 04:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
the department we'll submit those plans
 
04:42:22.190 --> 04:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
for approval by regulating agencies will
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
draft right-of-way plans
 
04:42:26.448 --> 04:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
we'll go through the right-of-way plan
 
04:42:30.170 --> 04:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
process of appraisal and acquisitions
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
will develop preliminary plan
 
04:42:35.330 --> 04:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
specifications and estimates submission
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
and review and final plan specifications
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
and estimates prior to advertising the
 
04:42:41.878 --> 04:42:43.070 align:start position:0%
and estimates prior to advertising the
project

04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:42:46.610 --> 04:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
the above process is estimated to delay
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
the static construction for the project
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
from 2024 to 2025 and ultimately delay
 
04:42:58.788 --> 04:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
the connection of exit 4A to Folsom Road
 
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
the work of the Department of
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation impacts every citizen
 
04:43:05.930 --> 04:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
every day when it comes to planning
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
designing and constructing our state
 
04:43:11.208 --> 04:43:11.218 align:start position:0%
transportation system we have a robust
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
tenure plan process that includes public
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
hearings legislative approvals and
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
signature by the governor when it comes
 
04:43:23.448 --> 04:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
to individual project designs we work
 
04:43:26.270 --> 04:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
closely with communities and we host
 
04:43:26.280 --> 04:43:29.990 align:start position:0%
closely with communities and we host
public

04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.770 --> 04:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
meetings to receive public input in the
 
04:43:36.530 --> 04:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
case of the dairy Londonderry exit 4A
 
04:43:38.930 --> 04:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
project we are designing and
 
04:43:41.208 --> 04:43:41.218 align:start position:0%
constructing a roadway system that will
 
04:43:44.448 --> 04:43:44.458 align:start position:0%
be owned maintained and operated by the
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
towns of dairy and Londonderry we have
 
04:43:49.730 --> 04:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
hosted public meetings with the towns
 
04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
and ensured the interests of the public
 
04:43:54.770 --> 04:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
have been heard while we have not
 
04:43:58.610 --> 04:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
satisfied everyone the current design is
 
04:44:00.770 --> 04:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
supported by the town of dairy the
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
ultimate owner of the project we are
 
04:44:06.650 --> 04:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
providing safe open Scenic Trail
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
connectivity and we have considered
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
project cost long-term maintenance costs
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
and schedule
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing my
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll take any questions
 
04:44:23.448 --> 04:44:23.458 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:44:25.490 --> 04:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Ms
 
04:44:28.368 --> 04:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Mr Rodriguez
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
um in front of you on the table are two
 
04:44:30.780 --> 04:44:32.868 align:start position:0%
um in front of you on the table are two
maps

04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
maps
 
04:44:35.708 --> 04:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
um the one in yellow I got from your
 
04:44:41.570 --> 04:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
website it was dated October 2022 is
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:45.480 --> 04:44:48.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.448 --> 04:44:50.458 align:start position:0%
for the question yes the answer is yes
 
04:44:53.570 --> 04:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
and the other one is from Google Earth
 
04:44:56.810 --> 04:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
it shows the current state of this area
 
04:45:00.410 --> 04:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
is that accurate also yes yes okay good
 
04:45:00.420 --> 04:45:02.150 align:start position:0%
is that accurate also yes yes okay good
so

04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:05.090 --> 04:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
on the on the design plan
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
I see a traffic light at the corner of
 
04:45:10.270 --> 04:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
Folsom Road and North High Street
 
04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay and I see a
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
crosswalk going across the street
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
presumably with some Walk Don't Walk
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
control yes correct okay
 
04:45:26.570 --> 04:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
so why is it that that in itself is not
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
adequate for this Trail
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
be because we support a grade separated
 
04:45:36.948 --> 04:45:36.958 align:start position:0%
Crossing this is a busy road
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
um the the rail trail is a very well
 
04:45:43.368 --> 04:45:43.378 align:start position:0%
used facility and we support a grade
 
04:45:46.128 --> 04:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
grade separated Crossing for that Rail
 
04:45:46.138 --> 04:45:47.150 align:start position:0%
grade separated Crossing for that Rail
Trail

04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
Trail
 
04:45:49.730 --> 04:45:49.740 align:start position:0%
so we want to separate that heavy
 
04:45:52.850 --> 04:45:52.860 align:start position:0%
traffic on the rail trail from having to
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
interact with with
 
04:45:58.490 --> 04:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
um the vehicles on the newly constructed
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
roadway it's very true if you go north
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
into Londonderry the rail trail crosses
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
Route 28 a very busy road it's two lanes
 
04:46:10.310 --> 04:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
at that location
 
04:46:12.650 --> 04:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and it's an at-grade Crossing so
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
people have to wait for a gap in in the
 
04:46:18.770 --> 04:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
traffic but this is a new facility and
 
04:46:20.930 --> 04:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
it was a great time to provide that
 
04:46:22.970 --> 04:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
grade separation for the rail trail
 
04:46:22.980 --> 04:46:25.750 align:start position:0%
grade separation for the rail trail
users

04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is
 
04:46:31.550 --> 04:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
at this other location where it
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
intersects Route 28
 
04:46:36.890 --> 04:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
there is a traffic light and a crosswalk
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
no no I'm sorry there's no traffic light
 
04:46:42.410 --> 04:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
at that location the the trail uses
 
04:46:45.650 --> 04:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
simply need to stop wait for a gap in
 
04:46:48.770 --> 04:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
traffic and choose choose the time they
 
04:46:52.610 --> 04:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
cross all right but here they would they
 
04:46:54.770 --> 04:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
would have a walk light that lets them
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
go yes so be less dangerous yeah that
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
that is one potential alternative so one
 
04:47:04.730 --> 04:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
of one of the the things I tried to get
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
at in my testimony when when the
 
04:47:09.890 --> 04:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
department proposes a design like this
 
04:47:12.650 --> 04:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
there are many Alternatives there are
 
04:47:16.490 --> 04:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
there are many options and we work with
 
04:47:19.610 --> 04:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
the communities to find the best option
 
04:47:22.610 --> 04:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
at a cost we can afford in a schedule
 
04:47:25.368 --> 04:47:25.378 align:start position:0%
that we can afford the department from
 
04:47:27.890 --> 04:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this project has
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
supported a grade separated Crossing we
 
04:47:35.030 --> 04:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the currently post on on
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
this plan that that you pointed out to
 
04:47:41.208 --> 04:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
the currently proposed Crossing
 
04:47:45.110 --> 04:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
underneath the shields Brook bridge is
 
04:47:48.890 --> 04:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
the best balance of of those things of
 
04:47:53.208 --> 04:47:53.218 align:start position:0%
safety and of Costa Effectiveness and us
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.890 --> 04:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
but do you really think that someone
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
given the choice of waiting at a
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
crosswalk versus adding this long
 
04:48:07.680 --> 04:48:08.708 align:start position:0%
crosswalk versus adding this long
um

04:48:08.708 --> 04:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
trust this long passage via turning
 
04:48:14.810 --> 04:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
right going under going over
 
04:48:17.810 --> 04:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
Etc why would anyone use that right or
 
04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't someone I mean if I were there
 
04:48:23.570 --> 04:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
I and I was there I mean I I walked this
 
04:48:23.580 --> 04:48:25.310 align:start position:0%
I and I was there I mean I I walked this
area

04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I would think I would just wait for
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
the light and cross no
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's an option that users will have I
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you this will be a beautiful
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
Trail so people use the trail for all
 
04:48:40.128 --> 04:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
different reasons they use a trail to
 
04:48:43.850 --> 04:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
get some perhaps directly from point A
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
to point B others to recreate to enjoy
 
04:48:50.448 --> 04:48:50.458 align:start position:0%
time with their their families their
 
04:48:53.208 --> 04:48:53.218 align:start position:0%
their dogs or whatever on the trail a
 
04:48:55.730 --> 04:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
walk under that under that bridge by the
 
04:48:58.128 --> 04:48:58.138 align:start position:0%
Brook is going to be a nice part of that
 
04:49:01.850 --> 04:49:01.860 align:start position:0%
experience for people and that's a was a
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
major early on incentive to locate the
 
04:49:10.070 --> 04:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
trail yes it was a cost savings but
 
04:49:12.890 --> 04:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
there's also a firm belief by many of us
 
04:49:17.810 --> 04:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
that this Trail is it's not a circuitous
 
04:49:20.448 --> 04:49:20.458 align:start position:0%
spaghetti path that ruins people's
 
04:49:22.910 --> 04:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
experience it will interrupt somebody
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
and make it a little longer if you're
 
04:49:27.170 --> 04:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
trying to get from A to B this is going
 
04:49:29.390 --> 04:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
to be a nice Trail this is going to be
 
04:49:31.610 --> 04:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
derry's Trail you have committed people
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
who have testified that keep this Trail
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
up nice and this will be a nice place
 
04:49:39.110 --> 04:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
for them to do that that's the
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department's belief What would would be
 
04:49:43.550 --> 04:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
the cost savings if you only had the
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
crosswalk and did not include this the
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:51.708 --> 04:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
when Wendy will answer that
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
so um there was a couple questions asked
 
04:49:56.570 --> 04:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
earlier that I I want to sort of address
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
somebody had asked the current bridge is
 
04:50:01.490 --> 04:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
63 feet and would the if we got rid of
 
04:50:03.050 --> 04:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
the the trail underneath would the
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
bridge size be shorter and the answer to
 
04:50:06.830 --> 04:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
that is no the bridge was always 63 feet
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
so in this particular case if you got
 
04:50:10.670 --> 04:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
rid of the trail that goes underneath
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
the only thing you would be saving is if
 
04:50:15.170 --> 04:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
you notice that purple line which comes
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
around the purple line is needed for
 
04:50:19.730 --> 04:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
pedestrian connectivity up North High
 
04:50:21.530 --> 04:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
Street it's also needed for pedestrian
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
connectivity going along Folsom road so
 
04:50:25.490 --> 04:50:25.500 align:start position:0%
the only savings you would have would be
 
04:50:27.050 --> 04:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
the purple that comes around and
 
04:50:28.850 --> 04:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
underneath and reconnects back on this
 
04:50:30.770 --> 04:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
side so that would be the only cost
 
04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
savings that you would you would have
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
I see because there's sidewalks on both
 
04:50:38.930 --> 04:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
sides of Folsom Road that's correct so
 
04:50:40.910 --> 04:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're basically reusing that same
 
04:50:40.920 --> 04:50:42.350 align:start position:0%
we're basically reusing that same
facility

04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:50:44.270 --> 04:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
um if it were to be if it were to be
 
04:50:45.948 --> 04:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
changed and you can take a look at the
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
the top of the page you can see that
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
there's a narrower purple strip so the
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
one on the top of the sheet is only six
 
04:50:53.750 --> 04:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
feet wide whereas the one on the bottom
 
04:50:55.610 --> 04:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
is wider because it's going to be more
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
multi-use so you could have
 
04:51:00.410 --> 04:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
um more people traveling on it
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
Sweeney thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:51:10.490 --> 04:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
both for for testifying today
 
04:51:14.448 --> 04:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
the so the Box tunnel that the members
 
04:51:17.330 --> 04:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
of the town want was that the plan
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
approved by the federal government when
 
04:51:22.250 --> 04:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:24.470 --> 04:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
so when we so that's an interesting
 
04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
question so when we present something to
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government a concept goes
 
04:51:31.970 --> 04:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
over and so the concept is what what
 
04:51:33.410 --> 04:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
where we've been talking about this
 
04:51:35.090 --> 04:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
preliminary plan that's what everybody's
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
been talking about and so the the plan
 
04:51:39.890 --> 04:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily something that is this
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
is what's in the plan this is exactly
 
04:51:42.650 --> 04:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
what needs to be maintained this is what
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
has to happen because things change as
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
you go through design so what they
 
04:51:49.490 --> 04:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
approve is is a general concept overall
 
04:51:52.610 --> 04:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
so overall what we had agreed to at the
 
04:51:54.530 --> 04:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
time of the Federal Highway approval was
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
as as Dave had pointed out a grade
 
04:51:57.120 --> 04:51:58.550 align:start position:0%
as as Dave had pointed out a grade
separated

04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
separated
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
um a grade separated uh weight across
 
04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
the roadway but we never said it's
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
definitely has to be here or
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
definitively has to be there and there
 
04:52:07.970 --> 04:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
has been a lot of talk about a secondary
 
04:52:10.310 --> 04:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
Federal approval and what that is is
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
something called a NEPA reevaluation and
 
04:52:13.550 --> 04:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're working
 
04:52:15.288 --> 04:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
towards with this with this alternative
 
04:52:18.170 --> 04:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
and what that means is originally when
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
we had when we had that graphic we might
 
04:52:21.410 --> 04:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
not have had the footprint come all the
 
04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
way up here where that purple is we
 
04:52:23.690 --> 04:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
might not have had that come all the way
 
04:52:24.530 --> 04:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
up here
 
04:52:26.990 --> 04:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
so the NEPA reevaluation asks us to go
 
04:52:29.570 --> 04:52:29.580 align:start position:0%
back and they say are you guys impacting
 
04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
any more archaeological resources are
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
there any other issues that you're going
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
to be impacting aside from what you
 
04:52:36.530 --> 04:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
would have impacted with that big
 
04:52:38.030 --> 04:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statement
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
originally and in this particular case
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple extra little areas
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
that we've taken a look at we don't have
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
any additional archaeological impacts so
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the reevaluation is something we're
 
04:52:50.330 --> 04:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
currently working on we don't yet have a
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
date for a completion on that simply
 
04:52:54.230 --> 04:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
because we're waiting for what sort of
 
04:52:55.970 --> 04:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
comes out of here before we keep pushing
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
in One Direction
 
04:52:59.810 --> 04:52:59.820 align:start position:0%
one one more question thank you I'm
 
04:53:01.850 --> 04:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
channeling my uh representative McGuire
 
04:53:01.860 --> 04:53:05.390 align:start position:0%
channeling my uh representative McGuire
today

04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
when this contract was sent to the towns
 
04:53:10.010 --> 04:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
of dairy and Londonderry in December of
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
2015 was there an implied concept for
 
04:53:19.550 --> 04:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:22.490 --> 04:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say sold to but was
 
04:53:24.410 --> 04:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
there an understanding of a project that
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
included a box tunnel or was it a
 
04:53:29.030 --> 04:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
project that would go from point A to B
 
04:53:32.030 --> 04:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
however safest what was what was the
 
04:53:35.090 --> 04:53:35.100 align:start position:0%
Contra what under what assumptions
 
04:53:37.730 --> 04:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
was the contract pursued and signed by
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
the parties so in 2015 it would have
 
04:53:43.610 --> 04:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
been some sort of grade separated I
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't on the project at that time but
 
04:53:47.208 --> 04:53:47.218 align:start position:0%
it's likely that it probably did have
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
the visual look of the tunnel that's at
 
04:53:51.650 --> 04:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
that location but I couldn't necessarily
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't confirm that right now I could
 
04:53:54.590 --> 04:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
I could take a look at the paper but
 
04:53:56.868 --> 04:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
that's likely what was shown publicly at
 
04:53:58.610 --> 04:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
that time appreciate it thank you very
 
04:53:58.620 --> 04:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
that time appreciate it thank you very
much

04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you to the
 
04:54:09.410 --> 04:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
department for being here um I've worked
 
04:54:12.110 --> 04:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
with you over at public works for 10
 
04:54:15.050 --> 04:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
years and I've always had the highest
 
04:54:17.288 --> 04:54:17.298 align:start position:0%
respect for your work and your process
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate everything that you've
 
04:54:22.850 --> 04:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
done on this project
 
04:54:22.860 --> 04:54:23.628 align:start position:0%
done on this project
um

04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
so there's also been statements that
 
04:54:31.010 --> 04:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
this Trail would be subject to flooding
 
04:54:33.890 --> 04:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
when folks are talking about how uh
 
04:54:35.810 --> 04:54:35.820 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense for it to be there
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit about the
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.840 --> 04:54:44.270 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

04:54:44.270 --> 04:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:54:45.410 --> 04:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
um so there's been a lot of questions
 
04:54:47.150 --> 04:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
about the the bridge and we're going to
 
04:54:49.490 --> 04:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
go back to that 63 foot again the bridge
 
04:54:51.170 --> 04:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
is 63 feet because what we have
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
underneath there is we have a flood
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
plain that goes underneath there and
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
when we have a water crossing we have to
 
04:54:58.490 --> 04:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
meet something called Full bank with so
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
that means that we take a look at where
 
04:55:01.970 --> 04:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
the bank is and we keep making it wider
 
04:55:03.530 --> 04:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
and wider and wider so we can Encompass
 
04:55:05.628 --> 04:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
the whole Bridge so in in the whole
 
04:55:07.250 --> 04:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
water body so in this particular case
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
the bridge needed to be 63 feet and so
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
we were able to still add the the tunnel
 
04:55:15.288 --> 04:55:15.298 align:start position:0%
I mean the trail it goes right
 
04:55:16.670 --> 04:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
underneath we're still able to add that
 
04:55:18.410 --> 04:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
and as long as we don't make it go
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
higher than the 100 Year floodplain when
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
then we can go ahead and we can add the
 
04:55:24.288 --> 04:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
trail underneath so if you're in those
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
smaller storm events like a two-year
 
04:55:27.530 --> 04:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
storm or something like that so A two
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
percent chance of a storm occurring in a
 
04:55:31.010 --> 04:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
particular year you're not going to have
 
04:55:32.690 --> 04:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
any problems with the trail itself as
 
04:55:34.850 --> 04:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
far as flooding is concerned you get all
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
the way up above the 50-year storm you
 
04:55:39.410 --> 04:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
know there's but you have one in a
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
chance 50 years of this storm coming
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
along that's when you could potentially
 
04:55:45.650 --> 04:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
have flooding but it's it's just like
 
04:55:47.750 --> 04:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
you see right now with other other
 
04:55:49.070 --> 04:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
locations the water comes up and the
 
04:55:50.330 --> 04:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
water comes down so that's how we're
 
04:55:52.490 --> 04:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
designing it so the water can be within
 
04:55:54.110 --> 04:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
those materials and not affect the trail
 
04:55:56.030 --> 04:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
so if it if the water comes up we're not
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to rebuild we're not going
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
to have to rebuild that path every time
 
04:56:01.850 --> 04:56:01.860 align:start position:0%
that it rains and then um as as you had
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
indicated there's also the at grade
 
04:56:05.868 --> 04:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
crossing so if it does flood there is
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
still the ad grade crossing that could
 
04:56:09.770 --> 04:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
happen of course with a tunnel if you
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
went underneath the roadway you would
 
04:56:12.650 --> 04:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
still have those same concerns because
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
the tunnel that's over here no matter
 
04:56:17.330 --> 04:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
which option you have they both have to
 
04:56:18.890 --> 04:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
go down they both have to go underneath
 
04:56:21.050 --> 04:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
the roadway so that means that it comes
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
down and it goes under and that's a
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
perfect place for water to pond so
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
whether you're looking at the tunnel
 
04:56:27.530 --> 04:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
option or you're looking at the combined
 
04:56:29.690 --> 04:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
structure option you're still going to
 
04:56:31.310 --> 04:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
have the same situation and a flood
 
04:56:31.320 --> 04:56:32.930 align:start position:0%
have the same situation and a flood
event

04:56:32.930 --> 04:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
event
 
04:56:32.940 --> 04:56:36.110 align:start position:0%
event
foreign

04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
so could you describe the difference
 
04:56:43.550 --> 04:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
between the plan that was discussed with
 
04:56:45.288 --> 04:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
dairy and
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
had the support of the rail trail folks
 
04:56:50.650 --> 04:56:50.660 align:start position:0%
in 2020
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
versus the current Shield Brook proposal
 
04:56:56.770 --> 04:56:56.780 align:start position:0%
do you understand my question because
 
04:56:59.830 --> 04:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
they had subsequently pulled their
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation yep absolutely so um and
 
04:57:05.690 --> 04:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
I'll kind of go do a little bit of
 
04:57:07.070 --> 04:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
History to go with it so yes the
 
04:57:08.810 --> 04:57:08.820 align:start position:0%
original design that went out to the
 
04:57:11.208 --> 04:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
design build groups had the tunnel in it
 
04:57:13.310 --> 04:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
and so when the teams went out they're
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
all looking for ways to make the project
 
04:57:16.970 --> 04:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
better faster cheaper that's what
 
04:57:17.930 --> 04:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
they're looking for because that's how
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
they're going to gain the contract
 
04:57:20.448 --> 04:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
they're looking for innovation
 
04:57:22.128 --> 04:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
so they took a look at the options and
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
they came up with this this secondary
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
the secondary alternative which is um
 
04:57:27.770 --> 04:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
something that we've been called an
 
04:57:30.050 --> 04:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
alternative technical concept so the
 
04:57:32.208 --> 04:57:32.218 align:start position:0%
alternative technical concept looks very
 
04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
similar to what's shown in in purple
 
04:57:36.288 --> 04:57:36.298 align:start position:0%
right along the bottom of the sheet the
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
difference between the one that was
 
04:57:39.410 --> 04:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
shown in 2020 and the one that's shown
 
04:57:41.810 --> 04:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
now is the one that was in 2020 was
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
lower and hugged more closely the
 
04:57:45.770 --> 04:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
property that's on this bottom part of
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
the page
 
04:57:49.730 --> 04:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
and then what we've done is we have
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
um the the connection across the bottom
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
of Folsom Road still the same coming
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
around furland Drive is still about the
 
04:57:58.310 --> 04:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
same except in this option we've widened
 
04:58:00.890 --> 04:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
the trail to 15 feet around the corner
 
04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
here when it was 10 feet during the
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
alternative technical concept and we've
 
04:58:06.410 --> 04:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
softened some of the curves along here
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:14.868 --> 04:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
so it's basically the same plan with a
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
few tweaks to make it a nicer experience
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
and perhaps improve the safety so I just
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
had maybe a couple more questions
 
04:58:24.360 --> 04:58:27.590 align:start position:0%
had maybe a couple more questions
um

04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:27.600 --> 04:58:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:58:28.970 --> 04:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:31.430 --> 04:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
I realize there's a legal opinion
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
sitting here but as I understood the
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
contract that you had with dairy in
 
04:58:36.480 --> 04:58:38.150 align:start position:0%
contract that you had with dairy in
Londonderry

04:58:38.150 --> 04:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
Londonderry
 
04:58:41.330 --> 04:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
they paid their 10 million dollars and
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
they basically you were going to
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
continue to have stakeholder meetings
 
04:58:49.010 --> 04:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
and get input but they basically were
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
turning the design and administration of
 
04:58:56.330 --> 04:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
exit 4A over to you so the 10 million
 
04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
dollars was really for the exit design
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
including the rail trail and everything
 
04:59:06.830 --> 04:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
and if I further read the document it
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
looked to me like once they turned it
 
04:59:11.090 --> 04:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
over to you once you did all your
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
stakeholder meetings and a design
 
04:59:15.288 --> 04:59:15.298 align:start position:0%
process had been set
 
04:59:18.050 --> 04:59:18.060 align:start position:0%
if Dairy then came back and wanted to
 
04:59:21.530 --> 04:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
change something once this train was out
 
04:59:23.868 --> 04:59:23.878 align:start position:0%
of the station you could come back to
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
them and say if you really want to make
 
04:59:27.770 --> 04:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
this change then you're on the hook for
 
04:59:30.650 --> 04:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
is that the I think that's that's one
 
04:59:37.368 --> 04:59:37.378 align:start position:0%
way to read the agreement the agreement
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
certainly allows the ability of the
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
department and the town to negotiate
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
increased cost once it exceeds the
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
estimated costs the original estimated
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
cost and that cost was exceeded a long
 
04:59:54.530 --> 04:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
time ago yes
 
04:59:57.470 --> 04:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
which I would think was what
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass was alluding to in the
 
05:00:03.050 --> 05:00:03.060 align:start position:0%
in the letter that he sent I don't I
 
05:00:03.060 --> 05:00:04.190 align:start position:0%
in the letter that he sent I don't I
don't

05:00:04.190 --> 05:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
I think he was clearly clearly stating
 
05:00:07.378 --> 05:00:08.690 align:start position:0%
I think he was clearly clearly stating
that

05:00:08.690 --> 05:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:11.570 --> 05:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
um so that so that the town knows the
 
05:00:13.788 --> 05:00:13.798 align:start position:0%
expectation yes okay and then I just
 
05:00:18.050 --> 05:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's really important or would you agree
 
05:00:23.448 --> 05:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
it's really important that this project
 
05:00:27.350 --> 05:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
not for the rail trail not be viewed
 
05:00:32.208 --> 05:00:32.218 align:start position:0%
as an isolated thing but to be viewed as
 
05:00:35.690 --> 05:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
part of the exit 4A project in totality
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
and when you think about it you think
 
05:00:40.850 --> 05:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
about the if that you think about the
 
05:00:42.650 --> 05:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
trail but you're also thinking about
 
05:00:46.070 --> 05:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
what a long process it's been and the
 
05:00:49.788 --> 05:00:49.798 align:start position:0%
potential delay does affect the entire
 
05:00:52.850 --> 05:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
for a project and not just the
 
05:00:55.128 --> 05:00:55.138 align:start position:0%
development of the rail trail is that
 
05:01:00.530 --> 05:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
correct oh ABS absolutely I refer to the
 
05:01:03.590 --> 05:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
this rail trail Crossing as an element
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
of the design and when you put it in the
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
scope of the entire project from
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
exit 4A on on 93 all the way to its
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
Terminus 2.3 miles later at Route 102
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is a very small element however it
 
05:01:27.288 --> 05:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
is an important element and I can't
 
05:01:30.770 --> 05:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
stress that enough it pains me to to be
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
sitting here and to hear some of the
 
05:01:38.810 --> 05:01:38.820 align:start position:0%
allegations because we are not proposing
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
a terrible situation we are not
 
05:01:45.890 --> 05:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
proposing the the awfullest of of grades
 
05:01:50.208 --> 05:01:50.218 align:start position:0%
this has the potential to be a a very
 
05:01:53.448 --> 05:01:53.458 align:start position:0%
enjoyable experience for the trail the
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
trail users and that's what we want and
 
05:01:59.448 --> 05:01:59.458 align:start position:0%
we're not done investing in the in the
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
trail the town has applied for and
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
received a transportation Alternatives
 
05:02:08.810 --> 05:02:08.820 align:start position:0%
project to extend the trail further to
 
05:02:11.810 --> 05:02:11.820 align:start position:0%
to the north this is what we do with
 
05:02:14.208 --> 05:02:14.218 align:start position:0%
this is part of the Department of
 
05:02:14.218 --> 05:02:16.070 align:start position:0%
this is part of the Department of
Transportation

05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
05:02:26.090 --> 05:02:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.010 --> 05:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
05:02:29.570 --> 05:02:29.580 align:start position:0%
Could you
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
um summarize to the best of your ability
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
the effect of potentially a year delay
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
on the completion of the foray project
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
when you think of all the people that
 
05:02:47.330 --> 05:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
are relying on its prompt completion
 
05:02:47.340 --> 05:02:52.208 align:start position:0%
are relying on its prompt completion
um

05:02:52.208 --> 05:02:52.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
so so that is very difficult for for for
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
me to do other than to to say as has
 
05:03:04.128 --> 05:03:04.138 align:start position:0%
been stated many times this project has
 
05:03:08.690 --> 05:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
languished since the 80s there there has
 
05:03:11.330 --> 05:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
been a very difficult time getting
 
05:03:15.170 --> 05:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
everybody on the same page getting the
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
funding in line and getting a process to
 
05:03:22.850 --> 05:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
get this project done in 2015 that
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility was handed handed to the
 
05:03:28.730 --> 05:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
department and we do have a
 
05:03:32.270 --> 05:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility to meet our deadlines to
 
05:03:35.208 --> 05:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
the best that we can we certainly have a
 
05:03:38.570 --> 05:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility to meet our budget to to
 
05:03:41.330 --> 05:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
the best that we can and that is really
 
05:03:44.090 --> 05:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do in this case
 
05:03:47.930 --> 05:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
there's no no doubt costs have increased
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
and costs will continue to to increase
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
increase but we design our projects with
 
05:03:57.050 --> 05:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
a consideration to fiscal
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
to to be fiscally responsible and
 
05:04:04.910 --> 05:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.288 --> 05:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
further questions by a division member
 
05:04:09.298 --> 05:04:10.250 align:start position:0%
further questions by a division member
sure

05:04:10.250 --> 05:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman have you acquired
 
05:04:15.288 --> 05:04:15.298 align:start position:0%
these two large buildings and when is
 
05:04:17.330 --> 05:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
the current plan to demolish them and
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
break ground in this area so to to
 
05:04:23.150 --> 05:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
clarify you're talking about the one to
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
this side another one to this side we do
 
05:04:27.490 --> 05:04:27.500 align:start position:0%
own both of those structures
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's still one tenant that is in one
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
of the properties and is waiting until
 
05:04:35.448 --> 05:04:35.458 align:start position:0%
winter to vacate the story The Brewery
 
05:04:35.458 --> 05:04:36.650 align:start position:0%
winter to vacate the story The Brewery
correct

05:04:36.650 --> 05:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:04:38.510 --> 05:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
um there are two these both we own both
 
05:04:40.570 --> 05:04:40.580 align:start position:0%
these buildings these are both under our
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
13065 e project which is slated to
 
05:04:46.128 --> 05:04:46.138 align:start position:0%
advertising June of this year so they'll
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
be demolished After we receive approval
 
05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
for the project
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
and after that you would break ground
 
05:04:54.890 --> 05:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
and start building this yellow road yeah
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
so the yellow Road would be part of our
 
05:05:00.650 --> 05:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
B project which is the project that has
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
the the tunnel on it so
 
05:05:05.690 --> 05:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
these two will go way ahead of the way
 
05:05:11.448 --> 05:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up to representative
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
McGuire's question how many properties
 
05:05:19.310 --> 05:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
have you yet to acquire
 
05:05:22.690 --> 05:05:22.700 align:start position:0%
between 93 and
 
05:05:26.930 --> 05:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
102 or 28 or no it's a 2.3 mile project
 
05:05:31.490 --> 05:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
right so how many three point it's 2.3
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
miles 2.3 yeah it's 2.3 miles and the
 
05:05:36.470 --> 05:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
project is broken up into different
 
05:05:37.788 --> 05:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
different projects different sub
 
05:05:40.368 --> 05:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
projects so we've already advertised and
 
05:05:41.990 --> 05:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
constructed that first project which is
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
right at the interstate proper we've
 
05:05:45.650 --> 05:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
acquired all of those properties already
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
the B project has 65 properties on it
 
05:05:52.128 --> 05:05:52.138 align:start position:0%
and 10 full Acquisitions and so you
 
05:05:54.170 --> 05:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
still have like 50 that you have not
 
05:05:57.770 --> 05:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
acquired at least no what well what's
 
05:06:00.830 --> 05:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
what's the B project what is it yeah
 
05:06:03.170 --> 05:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
where is B project is that the area
 
05:06:05.628 --> 05:06:05.638 align:start position:0%
that's colored here that
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
because that's the first time I've heard
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
a project B project
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
so into Mr representative McGuire's
 
05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
question I guess we're looking at more
 
05:06:25.970 --> 05:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.970 --> 05:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
we were attempting to avoid going to the
 
05:06:32.890 --> 05:06:32.900 align:start position:0%
plans but we will go to the plans
 
05:06:36.530 --> 05:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
so um yeah there we go so what I what
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
I've got shown here is I've got
 
05:06:40.788 --> 05:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
um the the project so you can see that
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
there's the brown project on the far
 
05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
side that's the a project That's The
 
05:06:45.890 --> 05:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
Interchange proper that's the one we're
 
05:06:47.150 --> 05:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
building right now
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
the green one in the middle that's this
 
05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
one right here that's the one that's got
 
05:06:53.990 --> 05:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the trail on it and then this one right
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
here this is the C project which is
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
tornado Road and we've got work on the
 
05:07:01.010 --> 05:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
28 Bypass uh and 28 over here so the the
 
05:07:02.930 --> 05:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
dots themselves are the first round of
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
building demolitions that we already did
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
and the there's the three properties
 
05:07:08.810 --> 05:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
that you've noticed two of them and the
 
05:07:10.490 --> 05:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
third one is the Salvation Army property
 
05:07:12.288 --> 05:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
those three will be advertised in June
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
for demolition so that's this project
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
right right here and there are still 50
 
05:07:19.730 --> 05:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
properties to obtain in the that green
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
area yeah so it's about 50 here and
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's about a hundred more in this
 
05:07:23.040 --> 05:07:24.230 align:start position:0%
there's about a hundred more in this
location

05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
location
 
05:07:26.448 --> 05:07:26.458 align:start position:0%
so you had talked about what happens if
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
we delay any of the work here delaying
 
05:07:30.590 --> 05:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
the work
 
05:07:32.570 --> 05:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
um you know the the people that live
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
along this Corridor are very
 
05:07:36.230 --> 05:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're they're stressed and they they
 
05:07:37.730 --> 05:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
want to get this project going they want
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
to see the improvements in front of
 
05:07:41.448 --> 05:07:41.458 align:start position:0%
their house so extending the project any
 
05:07:43.490 --> 05:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
duration is also going to bring added
 
05:07:46.730 --> 05:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
stress to the to the the people of dairy
 
05:07:49.368 --> 05:07:49.378 align:start position:0%
I'm just speaking for myself here but if
 
05:07:51.650 --> 05:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
you still have at least 50 properties to
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
obtain how can you start the project
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
unless you've got all those properties
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
under agreement
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question so what we're
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
doing is we're prioritizing the projects
 
05:08:03.410 --> 05:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
because the B project advertises next
 
05:08:06.350 --> 05:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
and then the C advertises after that so
 
05:08:07.788 --> 05:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
we're working currently on the
 
05:08:09.770 --> 05:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions for the B project which are
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
the the like you said the 55-ish we have
 
05:08:13.970 --> 05:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
left and then we're going to move on to
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
the to the C project and at some point
 
05:08:17.330 --> 05:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
the B and the C will be acquiring them
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're using a
 
05:08:20.990 --> 05:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
consulting firm to do all of our
 
05:08:22.730 --> 05:08:22.740 align:start position:0%
appraisals and all of our Acquisitions
 
05:08:24.650 --> 05:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
and they believe that they can acquire
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
the properties on time
 
05:08:30.230 --> 05:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
so again just speaking for myself
 
05:08:32.330 --> 05:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
you folks have said
 
05:08:34.670 --> 05:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
um better faster cheaper I think that
 
05:08:36.590 --> 05:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
was what you said
 
05:08:38.690 --> 05:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
but if you can't acquire those
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
properties uh
 
05:08:43.490 --> 05:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
how is this tunnel going to really
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
impact I mean you could take years I sat
 
05:08:48.288 --> 05:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
on a commission to acquire properties in
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
Nashville years ago there's
 
05:08:52.490 --> 05:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
circumferential Highway and one of the
 
05:08:54.650 --> 05:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
biggest obstacles to that being built
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
costs but acquiring property so yeah I'm
 
05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
a little concerned about
 
05:09:02.330 --> 05:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
what's going to really cause the delay
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
here the tunnel
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of the properties so we
 
05:09:10.430 --> 05:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
have the time in the schedule for the
 
05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
acquisition of the properties
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what your situation was
 
05:09:16.010 --> 05:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
on the circumferential highway but here
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
we have the right to condemn so it's not
 
05:09:19.970 --> 05:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
one of those things where it can be an
 
05:09:22.250 --> 05:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
ongoing we get to a certain point we
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
follow the process and the guidelines we
 
05:09:26.090 --> 05:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
make offers and we go through all of
 
05:09:27.530 --> 05:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
that and then we can acquire the
 
05:09:27.540 --> 05:09:29.208 align:start position:0%
that and then we can acquire the
property

05:09:29.208 --> 05:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:09:31.670 --> 05:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so that won't that won't slow us down
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
but it's also not going to stop us from
 
05:09:36.050 --> 05:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
doing amicable negotiations either you
 
05:09:37.070 --> 05:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
know we want to make sure we get out
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
there and we're fair to everyone on the
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
property on the project so I appreciate
 
05:09:42.948 --> 05:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
you taking my questions I have a few
 
05:09:42.958 --> 05:09:44.690 align:start position:0%
you taking my questions I have a few
more

05:09:44.690 --> 05:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:09:44.700 --> 05:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
more
so

05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:49.670 --> 05:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
obviously there are a lot of people
 
05:09:49.680 --> 05:09:51.110 align:start position:0%
obviously there are a lot of people
upset

05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
upset
 
05:09:54.288 --> 05:09:54.298 align:start position:0%
however direction we take with this it
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
would seem the simplest answer at least
 
05:09:58.750 --> 05:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
again speaking for myself that someone
 
05:10:02.930 --> 05:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
whether it be the state or you know if
 
05:10:05.150 --> 05:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
we were King for the day I would just
 
05:10:08.330 --> 05:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
write a check for 750 000 because if
 
05:10:08.340 --> 05:10:09.350 align:start position:0%
write a check for 750 000 because if
someone

05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
someone
 
05:10:09.360 --> 05:10:11.448 align:start position:0%
someone
that

05:10:11.448 --> 05:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:10:14.510 --> 05:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
uses rail Trails as far as hiking and
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
biking it would seem that much more
 
05:10:19.910 --> 05:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
practical if you had the tunnel now I
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
also observed went to the site last
 
05:10:25.850 --> 05:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
Thursday and I observed a large six foot
 
05:10:28.850 --> 05:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
Culvert that's under maiden or Madden
 
05:10:30.650 --> 05:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
Road I guess it's called
 
05:10:32.930 --> 05:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
so there was already a passage under
 
05:10:35.810 --> 05:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
there before and traditionally railroad
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
bridges are well in excess of I think 16
 
05:10:41.390 --> 05:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
and a half 17 feet and there was a
 
05:10:43.850 --> 05:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
bridge there so it seemed to make sense
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
to to me again not an expert but to put
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
that tunnel in I think a lot of people
 
05:10:52.810 --> 05:10:52.820 align:start position:0%
would be very happy the biking Community
 
05:10:55.910 --> 05:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
I looked at the usage allowed on that
 
05:10:58.970 --> 05:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
trail it's like snowmobile use and I'm
 
05:11:01.750 --> 05:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the scenic
 
05:11:04.730 --> 05:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
so-called Scenic Trail down to Shields
 
05:11:07.128 --> 05:11:07.138 align:start position:0%
Brook and I can't imagine a snowmobile
 
05:11:10.250 --> 05:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
like maneuvering around those curves so
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just very concerned again I would
 
05:11:14.208 --> 05:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
hope that we can get to a solution
 
05:11:15.948 --> 05:11:15.958 align:start position:0%
because they think the representatives
 
05:11:18.410 --> 05:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
from dairy have made some strong points
 
05:11:20.208 --> 05:11:20.218 align:start position:0%
I think you've made some strong points
 
05:11:24.410 --> 05:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
as far as minimizing the cost but I
 
05:11:26.090 --> 05:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
think there's a win in here for somebody
 
05:11:29.150 --> 05:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
for maybe everybody but if the
 
05:11:31.368 --> 05:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
department you know digs himself and we
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
can't do this or the proponents of the
 
05:11:37.368 --> 05:11:37.378 align:start position:0%
tunnel are not really willing to
 
05:11:39.890 --> 05:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
compromise and it would appear that
 
05:11:42.170 --> 05:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get somewhere but
 
05:11:44.448 --> 05:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see what you both would have
 
05:11:46.850 --> 05:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
to offer David or
 
05:11:48.890 --> 05:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
because obviously the department wants
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
something safe I think all of us do
 
05:11:51.600 --> 05:11:52.930 align:start position:0%
something safe I think all of us do
but

05:11:52.930 --> 05:11:52.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:11:55.730 --> 05:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
I can't see where this
 
05:11:59.330 --> 05:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
crosswalk that goes over six plus Lanes
 
05:12:02.330 --> 05:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
of traffic is ideal for somebody that's
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
riding a bike they have to wait or they
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
say I'm going to run across here and
 
05:12:06.600 --> 05:12:07.490 align:start position:0%
say I'm going to run across here and
um

05:12:07.490 --> 05:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
so again I've said enough I'd like to
 
05:12:11.510 --> 05:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
hear a little more from you as how we
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
make this thing work so we can walk away
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
where people are fairly happy with what
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
we've decided
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you for your
 
05:12:20.520 --> 05:12:21.830 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you for your
question

05:12:21.830 --> 05:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to invite Wendy to pull up
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
another one of her plans with the
 
05:12:29.510 --> 05:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
profile that that will
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
um show answer some of your questions
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
but I want to add a a few points as as
 
05:12:37.080 --> 05:12:38.750 align:start position:0%
but I want to add a a few points as as
well

05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:12:41.448 --> 05:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
um so it is in fact true that at one
 
05:12:44.208 --> 05:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
point I believe it was Madden Road did
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
go over the the railroad this new
 
05:12:51.230 --> 05:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
alignment is no Madden Road and this new
 
05:12:53.570 --> 05:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
alignment is not going in the same
 
05:12:56.990 --> 05:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
location as Madden Road hence you you
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
see the building demolition so the new
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
road will be considerably lower than
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
Madden Road as you were out there
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
looking and as you saw that pipe
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
underneath my Madden Road I'm sure you
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
noticed the water in it and I'm sure you
 
05:13:16.128 --> 05:13:16.138 align:start position:0%
noticed the Bramble down below I don't
 
05:13:17.690 --> 05:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people are cutting
 
05:13:21.170 --> 05:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
through that today nor do I think that
 
05:13:24.050 --> 05:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
that was the the full intent of that but
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know and then following on to
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
the snowmobile use there are rural
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
trails that that absolutely that's a
 
05:13:36.650 --> 05:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
great use the the trails I saw in Derry
 
05:13:39.230 --> 05:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
the rail trail portions they're mostly
 
05:13:42.110 --> 05:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
plowed they're they're most what I
 
05:13:45.470 --> 05:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
observed is mostly pedestrian activity I
 
05:13:47.868 --> 05:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if I would expect snowmobiles
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
along that portion of the corridor not
 
05:13:52.250 --> 05:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
saying it couldn't couldn't happen
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's there is will be dairy's
 
05:13:56.090 --> 05:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
rail trail
 
05:13:57.770 --> 05:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's much heavier
 
05:14:01.010 --> 05:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
pedestrian activity Wendy
 
05:14:03.770 --> 05:14:03.780 align:start position:0%
so good so I think
 
05:14:06.650 --> 05:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so this is sort of a comparison of
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
everything that we've been talking about
 
05:14:12.410 --> 05:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
um so this is so the green dash line
 
05:14:16.510 --> 05:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
here is your existing ground condition
 
05:14:18.708 --> 05:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
the the blue line is what we're
 
05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
currently proposing in this red line up
 
05:14:22.730 --> 05:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
here would have been what would have
 
05:14:25.250 --> 05:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
been underneath that 2015 sort of time
 
05:14:27.948 --> 05:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
frame that's that preliminary plan
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
so as you look at this let's start with
 
05:14:31.550 --> 05:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
the preliminary plan when you look at
 
05:14:33.650 --> 05:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
the preliminary plan one of the other
 
05:14:34.850 --> 05:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
reasons that we were talking about
 
05:14:36.650 --> 05:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
wanting to change it is is you're come
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
down on the red line
 
05:14:41.930 --> 05:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at about a 2.7 grade
 
05:14:43.910 --> 05:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
right here that's that proposed box
 
05:14:45.410 --> 05:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
Culvert that we've been talking about
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
you come down about 7.1 percent grade
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
you hit the shields Brook bridge and
 
05:14:53.270 --> 05:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
then Franklin Street so it was also a
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
concern with the original design that
 
05:14:57.410 --> 05:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
you're becoming in at a 7.1 grade right
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
into the signalized intersection so that
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
was one other thing that we were trying
 
05:15:04.190 --> 05:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
to address by combining the Box Culvert
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
with with the bridge
 
05:15:08.090 --> 05:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
so in the revised option when you don't
 
05:15:09.530 --> 05:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
have the tunnel to go up and over
 
05:15:09.540 --> 05:15:10.430 align:start position:0%
have the tunnel to go up and over
anymore

05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:15:12.770 --> 05:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
you come down at about a 2.9 percent
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
grade and then it comes down to 3.64 and
 
05:15:18.170 --> 05:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
then it stays around 2.3 so the one
 
05:15:19.730 --> 05:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
thing to note here is you have
 
05:15:21.530 --> 05:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
pedestrians on this road too this is
 
05:15:23.390 --> 05:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
where your pedestrians that purple box I
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
was showing you so your pedestrians are
 
05:15:27.770 --> 05:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
going to have to walk 7.1 percent and
 
05:15:28.788 --> 05:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a hump in the road
 
05:15:30.530 --> 05:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
so that's why we wanted to to do this
 
05:15:31.670 --> 05:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I know that there's a lot of people
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
who are going to say well why don't we
 
05:15:35.150 --> 05:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
just lower the box and do that and then
 
05:15:36.530 --> 05:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
we don't have to worry about it and we
 
05:15:38.090 --> 05:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
have what we have here is we have some
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
high bedrock at this location and we
 
05:15:42.410 --> 05:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
also have a groundwater issue so the
 
05:15:44.690 --> 05:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
lower we make this the wetter and the
 
05:15:46.610 --> 05:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
darker and this is always going to be
 
05:15:48.530 --> 05:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
full of water and we don't we don't want
 
05:15:50.570 --> 05:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
that so
 
05:15:53.208 --> 05:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question somewhat
 
05:15:55.128 --> 05:15:55.138 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
05:15:57.530 --> 05:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
is is there a clarifying point I could
 
05:15:59.628 --> 05:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
help with
 
05:16:01.550 --> 05:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
well I looked at the topography out
 
05:16:03.948 --> 05:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
there and it's very steep like you said
 
05:16:07.250 --> 05:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
and then as you get closer hitting North
 
05:16:09.288 --> 05:16:09.298 align:start position:0%
told towards Londonderry it actually
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
remains pretty significant and then it
 
05:16:14.810 --> 05:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
drops off very sharply where the trail
 
05:16:16.368 --> 05:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
would come in it was a very steep
 
05:16:19.850 --> 05:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
banking down to Shields Brook I believe
 
05:16:19.860 --> 05:16:21.830 align:start position:0%
banking down to Shields Brook I believe
um

05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:27.050 --> 05:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.010 --> 05:16:30.020 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll take a break for questions
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
other members of the division
 
05:16:35.930 --> 05:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative Griffin
 
05:16:38.090 --> 05:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
I have a question thank you Mr chairman
 
05:16:39.530 --> 05:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
I have a question I'm not sure whether
 
05:16:41.990 --> 05:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's to you at the Wendy but
 
05:16:44.930 --> 05:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
you talked about the properties that
 
05:16:46.628 --> 05:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
still need to be
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
purchased to complete the project and we
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
talked earlier about the extended time
 
05:16:56.150 --> 05:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
that would result from going to
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
the tunnel aspect
 
05:17:01.250 --> 05:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
were you trying to
 
05:17:04.490 --> 05:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
make a link there where those those two
 
05:17:06.410 --> 05:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
things made overlap
 
05:17:08.930 --> 05:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
or are they consecutive
 
05:17:10.730 --> 05:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
you're very perceptive for
 
05:17:13.330 --> 05:17:13.340 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
because again it would seem to me unless
 
05:17:17.690 --> 05:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
you get all those properties you're not
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to go out and put the project out
 
05:17:21.650 --> 05:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
to bid especially if there's some that
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
significantly impact the proposed Road
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's where I get back to that
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
timeline We Believe with the current
 
05:17:30.050 --> 05:17:30.060 align:start position:0%
timeline that we have with the current
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
impacts with their that we're showing we
 
05:17:35.208 --> 05:17:35.218 align:start position:0%
can make the advertising date if we
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
change where the where the tunnel is and
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
we change where the location is it
 
05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
changes the impacts of those properties
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
so essentially it starts those
 
05:17:46.910 --> 05:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions over if if you go in in
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
that direction so if we keep moving
 
05:17:51.530 --> 05:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
there is no delay but if you have to
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
redo all the properties because you'd
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
basically have to come back from all the
 
05:17:57.530 --> 05:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
properties west of Franklin Street
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
reassess all the impacts and reacquire
 
05:18:02.750 --> 05:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
any land in that area although we
 
05:18:04.730 --> 05:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
haven't acquired the land we're working
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
on appraisals and we're doing that sort
 
05:18:08.570 --> 05:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
of thing so we're we're far along in in
 
05:18:10.128 --> 05:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
the process
 
05:18:12.170 --> 05:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
could we pin you down and when you say
 
05:18:14.090 --> 05:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
far along is that you anticipate
 
05:18:15.770 --> 05:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
acquiring all these properties within
 
05:18:18.288 --> 05:18:18.298 align:start position:0%
two weeks or two years they will be
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
acquired within like the
 
05:18:22.910 --> 05:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
11 months
 
05:18:24.650 --> 05:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
but because there are there are a lot of
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
properties there and we don't do them
 
05:18:28.250 --> 05:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
all at once that was my concern they're
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually a lot of properties there there
 
05:18:31.910 --> 05:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
are but we have a big team
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
um and we're we're taking care of it
 
05:18:35.570 --> 05:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's in our schedule
 
05:18:38.208 --> 05:18:38.218 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues that came up I
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
asked about the zoning in that area and
 
05:18:41.930 --> 05:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
they said most of the area has now been
 
05:18:43.610 --> 05:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
rezoned I believe there was a member of
 
05:18:45.288 --> 05:18:45.298 align:start position:0%
the planning board there
 
05:18:49.850 --> 05:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
so the properties where this proposed
 
05:18:53.570 --> 05:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
the Getty Scenic Trail runs will
 
05:18:56.570 --> 05:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
probably become commercial properties
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
and there are several homes there how is
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
that going to impact this Scenic Trail
 
05:19:03.770 --> 05:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you've got you know a 7-Eleven there
 
05:19:04.970 --> 05:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
or something because this is going to
 
05:19:06.470 --> 05:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
become a major
 
05:19:06.480 --> 05:19:08.570 align:start position:0%
become a major
intersection

05:19:08.570 --> 05:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
05:19:10.970 --> 05:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
I would guess looking at it
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
so I did ask that the town if there was
 
05:19:16.250 --> 05:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
any zoning changes and I didn't get any
 
05:19:18.050 --> 05:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
any idea that there were going to be any
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
zoning changes coming so zoning changes
 
05:19:24.170 --> 05:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
are not part of the Department's project
 
05:19:24.180 --> 05:19:26.590 align:start position:0%
are not part of the Department's project
foreign

05:19:26.590 --> 05:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
if I may just following up again the
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
zoning would be the responsibility of
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
the town and I honestly look at it both
 
05:19:35.760 --> 05:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
the town and I honestly look at it both
ways

05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
ways
 
05:19:40.910 --> 05:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
um you know what what we don't know if
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
if indeed it is commercial development
 
05:19:46.070 --> 05:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
the rail trail could provide a great
 
05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for customers to to get to
 
05:19:52.730 --> 05:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
that commercial development maybe it's a
 
05:19:55.250 --> 05:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
7-Eleven or maybe it's something that
 
05:19:59.570 --> 05:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
that the trail uses would appreciate
 
05:20:02.350 --> 05:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
um again it pains me to see this
 
05:20:06.730 --> 05:20:06.740 align:start position:0%
characterized as some awful Draconian
 
05:20:10.490 --> 05:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
solution we honestly feel and and this
 
05:20:13.550 --> 05:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
solution came about as a way of
 
05:20:15.948 --> 05:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
improving the experience for the people
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
on the on the rail trail not ruining the
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
rail trail for for folks in in Dairy and
 
05:20:25.368 --> 05:20:25.378 align:start position:0%
we honestly believe it will improve the
 
05:20:30.070 --> 05:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.570 --> 05:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative hatch for sure
 
05:20:35.628 --> 05:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
thank you just just to concern back to
 
05:20:37.970 --> 05:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to beat a horse to death
 
05:20:41.030 --> 05:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
but in the acquiring the properties I
 
05:20:42.650 --> 05:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
think of where I live
 
05:20:44.750 --> 05:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
um near where I live in Jefferson room
 
05:20:46.910 --> 05:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
two there's been properties that have
 
05:20:49.970 --> 05:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
been holding that project up for many
 
05:20:52.730 --> 05:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
05:20:56.690 --> 05:20:56.700 align:start position:0%
um and I hear 65 to 50 properties
 
05:20:58.970 --> 05:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
needing to be acquired
 
05:21:01.128 --> 05:21:01.138 align:start position:0%
um and what you're saying is you're
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
totally confident
 
05:21:04.910 --> 05:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
that you'll be able to acquire all these
 
05:21:08.030 --> 05:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
without any hiccups so to speak that
 
05:21:10.250 --> 05:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
would uh interfere with this project it
 
05:21:13.010 --> 05:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
just doesn't comport with me that's yeah
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
and so yeah no that's a great question
 
05:21:18.050 --> 05:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
and it is always a sensitive subject but
 
05:21:19.788 --> 05:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
to be clear we're not buying full
 
05:21:22.010 --> 05:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
properties either we're maybe buying a
 
05:21:23.810 --> 05:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
drainage easement from one property or a
 
05:21:26.090 --> 05:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
slow easement from somebody else so we
 
05:21:27.708 --> 05:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
have been in contact with our with our
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
consulting firm they're the ones we've
 
05:21:30.590 --> 05:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
hired to do this work and they are
 
05:21:32.690 --> 05:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
confident that we can get the we can get
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
it done we've seen the schedule and and
 
05:21:36.470 --> 05:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're confident in them
 
05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.310 --> 05:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
I lost my thought there oh Jefferson
 
05:21:45.830 --> 05:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
there we go Jefferson was done by
 
05:21:47.810 --> 05:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
internal staff which is a much smaller
 
05:21:49.310 --> 05:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
staff than the firm that we've actually
 
05:21:51.230 --> 05:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
hired which is you know we've got a
 
05:21:53.030 --> 05:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
handful of Agents six eight agents and
 
05:21:55.490 --> 05:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
these guys have you know dozens of
 
05:21:57.050 --> 05:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
Agents they're going to be working on
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
this so it's it's a little bit different
 
05:22:00.530 --> 05:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
than an in-house project for
 
05:22:01.970 --> 05:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
right-of-way acquisition because it's
 
05:22:04.490 --> 05:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
much more horsepower from the consultant
 
05:22:04.500 --> 05:22:06.170 align:start position:0%
much more horsepower from the consultant
side

05:22:06.170 --> 05:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
side
 
05:22:11.050 --> 05:22:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:14.030 --> 05:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
so that that clears it up for me that if
 
05:22:15.890 --> 05:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
you're not acquiring full properties you
 
05:22:15.900 --> 05:22:17.030 align:start position:0%
you're not acquiring full properties you
just

05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:22:19.310 --> 05:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
um acquiring parts of many yeah so to
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
speak thank you thank you
 
05:22:24.110 --> 05:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
05:22:25.610 --> 05:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um well I guess I would say it's not
 
05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
like the neighborhood doesn't know this
 
05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
is coming either right
 
05:22:32.160 --> 05:22:32.810 align:start position:0%
is coming either right
um

05:22:32.810 --> 05:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:22:36.470 --> 05:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
setting aside the financial issue I
 
05:22:38.810 --> 05:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
think this issue of delay is one that a
 
05:22:41.650 --> 05:22:41.660 align:start position:0%
lot of people have are concerned about
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
so the condemnation or the acquisition
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh timeline is going along like this so
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
if we
 
05:22:54.890 --> 05:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
require the Box tunnel if if this uh
 
05:22:57.230 --> 05:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
legislation say passes the house then it
 
05:22:58.970 --> 05:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
has to go through the Senate then it has
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
to go so how does it is it really going
 
05:23:06.650 --> 05:23:06.660 align:start position:0%
to take a year more than the property
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
acquisition I mean at I'm just trying to
 
05:23:12.770 --> 05:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
understand the timelines yeah and so
 
05:23:14.570 --> 05:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
that gets into the schedule that Dave
 
05:23:17.330 --> 05:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
had talked about is once we change the
 
05:23:19.850 --> 05:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
impacts to those areas we can't change
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
those impacts to those areas until we go
 
05:23:24.288 --> 05:23:24.298 align:start position:0%
through that process that he outlined we
 
05:23:25.550 --> 05:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
have to do a scope and fee with the
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
consultant because they've already done
 
05:23:29.090 --> 05:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
it once so we have to stop telling them
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
to hold their horses come up with a new
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
agreement pay them you know figure what
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
they want to be paid for this this new
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
version and all those things need to go
 
05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
through Federal Highway and the governor
 
05:23:40.128 --> 05:23:40.138 align:start position:0%
and executive Council for approval so
 
05:23:42.288 --> 05:23:42.298 align:start position:0%
until we get through all those steps we
 
05:23:44.208 --> 05:23:44.218 align:start position:0%
can't even start to go back to redraw
 
05:23:47.690 --> 05:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
lines on these plans and so in and it's
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
not just so much drawing a line on the
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
plan you've actually got to go and
 
05:23:52.850 --> 05:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
you've got to put those new those new
 
05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
profiles on there and figure out where
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
the water is going and then you you know
 
05:23:57.050 --> 05:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
that we've got all these different
 
05:23:59.570 --> 05:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
processes and then you know we have to
 
05:24:00.530 --> 05:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
figure out what happens to the utility
 
05:24:02.330 --> 05:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
abilities if we do all this stuff all
 
05:24:03.770 --> 05:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
that stuff has to be worked out before
 
05:24:05.930 --> 05:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
we can start doing the right-of-way so
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
it basically puts a pin in being able to
 
05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
even start that until we get all the way
 
05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
back to that point if that makes sense
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
just follow up so and and you can't
 
05:24:20.590 --> 05:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
really start any of that until this
 
05:24:23.330 --> 05:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
legislation passes if it's signed into
 
05:24:28.150 --> 05:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:31.010 --> 05:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
right and that could take maybe six
 
05:24:33.288 --> 05:24:33.298 align:start position:0%
months in another or four months in and
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
of itself so you have that's an additive
 
05:24:38.208 --> 05:24:38.218 align:start position:0%
that we're just not really thinking that
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
much about okay or I wasn't thank you
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
so the division has several options to
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
consider at this point we do have an
 
05:24:52.510 --> 05:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I think that was offered by
 
05:24:55.368 --> 05:24:55.378 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
05:24:57.830 --> 05:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
to remove uh well it was given to the
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee the committee hasn't accepted
 
05:25:01.390 --> 05:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
yet that's to remove the
 
05:25:04.010 --> 05:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges against some of our
 
05:25:07.910 --> 05:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
friends at the dot we
 
05:25:09.948 --> 05:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
have that before us
 
05:25:13.190 --> 05:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
we can act on that or we can act on the
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill that we have before us and there's
 
05:25:18.170 --> 05:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
several options a committee a division
 
05:25:22.010 --> 05:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
could vote to retain the bill we could
 
05:25:25.550 --> 05:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
in expedient legislate the bill we could
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
ought to pass the bill
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
Mike do you have that amendment that
 
05:25:42.948 --> 05:25:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that representative
 
05:25:47.530 --> 05:25:47.540 align:start position:0%
Stapleton offered
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh again was to remove the
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges that were contained
 
05:25:56.810 --> 05:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
in the original draft of the spill
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
but again there are a lot of options for
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
us to consider
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:11.410 --> 05:26:11.420 align:start position:0%
Mr takers
 
05:26:14.270 --> 05:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you this isn't
 
05:26:16.128 --> 05:26:16.138 align:start position:0%
exactly what you had in mind actually
 
05:26:18.830 --> 05:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
but there's a member of the Town Council
 
05:26:21.948 --> 05:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
of Derry here and I just wondered if he
 
05:26:24.170 --> 05:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
would with your forbearance if there
 
05:26:26.090 --> 05:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
would be anything that he'd like to add
 
05:26:29.030 --> 05:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the conversation I'd be interested to
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
know for instance whether the email that
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
we got from Mr born was something that
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
had been discussed with the council or
 
05:26:40.010 --> 05:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
or if he'd like to add to the
 
05:26:42.110 --> 05:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
conversation at all
 
05:26:45.708 --> 05:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
uh if he wishes to come forward if is
 
05:26:52.310 --> 05:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.650 --> 05:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
again thank the D.O.T for their
 
05:26:54.660 --> 05:26:58.250 align:start position:0%
again thank the D.O.T for their
presentation

05:26:58.250 --> 05:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
if you could please state your name for
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
the record and if your last name again
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
is difficult to spell
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
get your PIN thank you Mr chairman
 
05:27:12.770 --> 05:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Brian churchillo c h
 
05:27:18.050 --> 05:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
i r i c h i e l l o
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
I am a member of the Derry Town Council
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh I am in my sixth term
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
at the Derry Town Council you must enjoy
 
05:27:31.070 --> 05:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
a punishment oh yeah yeah
 
05:27:33.110 --> 05:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I want to say is the
 
05:27:35.570 --> 05:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
letter from chairman Borden was on
 
05:27:39.170 --> 05:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
himself not uh in correspondence with
 
05:27:42.170 --> 05:27:42.180 align:start position:0%
the other town councilors so he took it
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
upon him he's acting on his own opinion
 
05:27:45.600 --> 05:27:46.550 align:start position:0%
upon him he's acting on his own opinion
um

05:27:46.550 --> 05:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:49.330 --> 05:27:49.340 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
05:27:52.368 --> 05:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
Acquisitions and whatnot as as it was
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned this project has been
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussed since the mid 80s all these
 
05:27:58.190 --> 05:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
people know it was going down there
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're already they all they already
 
05:28:03.050 --> 05:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
are prepared for for this to happen so
 
05:28:04.910 --> 05:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
there'd be no surprises there
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
as far as the zoning is concerned I'm
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
also a member of the liaison to the
 
05:28:11.208 --> 05:28:11.218 align:start position:0%
planning board and spent many years on a
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
planning board so we started rezoning a
 
05:28:16.250 --> 05:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
small section
 
05:28:18.890 --> 05:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
we have not continued to do that further
 
05:28:18.900 --> 05:28:19.670 align:start position:0%
we have not continued to do that further
down

05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:28:22.190 --> 05:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
so there's still more rezoning to do but
 
05:28:25.070 --> 05:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
keep in mind when you rezone there's a
 
05:28:27.410 --> 05:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
thing that's called grandfathering
 
05:28:29.270 --> 05:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
so if you are a home and you don't want
 
05:28:30.708 --> 05:28:30.718 align:start position:0%
to change the commercial if we change
 
05:28:32.448 --> 05:28:32.458 align:start position:0%
the zoning to Commercial and you want to
 
05:28:34.250 --> 05:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
keep your home as a home you get to keep
 
05:28:35.810 --> 05:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
your home as a home
 
05:28:38.628 --> 05:28:38.638 align:start position:0%
no pressure there
 
05:28:38.638 --> 05:28:39.650 align:start position:0%
no pressure there
um

05:28:39.650 --> 05:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
there's been so much conversation here
 
05:28:44.750 --> 05:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
that I really wanted to add in but uh
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
the five million dollar is Believe It or
 
05:28:50.030 --> 05:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
Not in the mid 80s the the the
 
05:28:52.910 --> 05:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
exit 4A and at one time they also
 
05:28:54.590 --> 05:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
thought about on exit 3A
 
05:28:56.810 --> 05:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
would have cost 15 million and here we
 
05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
are today at 104 million
 
05:29:02.390 --> 05:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
so you can see what happens when you get
 
05:29:04.490 --> 05:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
when delays happen it just the costs
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
just keep increasing
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
um the town of Derry paid
 
05:29:12.288 --> 05:29:12.298 align:start position:0%
half of that 2.5 million dollars
 
05:29:14.750 --> 05:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
up front to all the engineering work and
 
05:29:17.628 --> 05:29:17.638 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and whatnot we
 
05:29:19.970 --> 05:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
bonded the the second half of that so
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
future taxpayers would pay into that
 
05:29:23.040 --> 05:29:25.628 align:start position:0%
future taxpayers would pay into that
foreign

05:29:25.628 --> 05:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
the discussion that you have to look at
 
05:29:30.530 --> 05:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
the project as a whole
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
um and this is to alleviate downtown
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
traffic in in Derry
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
because where if you ever take if you
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
get off the highway exit four and you're
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
going through the downtown
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
at gridlocks
 
05:29:45.890 --> 05:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
and it queues up and what tends to
 
05:29:47.570 --> 05:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
happen is the people will actually take
 
05:29:49.550 --> 05:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
these side roads
 
05:29:51.530 --> 05:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of these teeny roads that were
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
never meant for for that that type of
 
05:29:57.948 --> 05:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
traffic volume so the idea was
 
05:29:57.958 --> 05:29:59.570 align:start position:0%
traffic volume so the idea was
that

05:29:59.570 --> 05:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:30:03.230 --> 05:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
exit 4A would be an economic driver for
 
05:30:04.610 --> 05:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
both Londonderry
 
05:30:06.288 --> 05:30:06.298 align:start position:0%
and Dairy
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
the extra benefit for dairy would be
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
would alleviate some traffic and now I
 
05:30:12.830 --> 05:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
have two paths going east to west
 
05:30:15.410 --> 05:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
to East
 
05:30:15.420 --> 05:30:16.670 align:start position:0%
to East
so

05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:18.170 --> 05:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
and then and then we could actually do
 
05:30:21.050 --> 05:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
some work on the downtown but anyway I
 
05:30:24.288 --> 05:30:24.298 align:start position:0%
do want to say that um
 
05:30:26.330 --> 05:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
I talked to Chairman Borden I do not
 
05:30:28.010 --> 05:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
believe that the matter should have come
 
05:30:29.810 --> 05:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
up to the Town Council at the time
 
05:30:33.170 --> 05:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
because as you were heard in 2015
 
05:30:35.810 --> 05:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
we basically handed over the keys to the
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
state and we said we're done Our
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
obligation is done
 
05:30:42.170 --> 05:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
here you go they consulted with us
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
and um when the alternative plan came up
 
05:30:47.150 --> 05:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
my um
 
05:30:49.550 --> 05:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
director of Public Works looked at the
 
05:30:52.850 --> 05:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
plan and said it was acceptable to him
 
05:30:54.770 --> 05:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
um but he said I would highly recommend
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
that you go to the drta and and let them
 
05:31:00.288 --> 05:31:00.298 align:start position:0%
know about it my understanding was is
 
05:31:01.850 --> 05:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
that they approved
 
05:31:05.050 --> 05:31:05.060 align:start position:0%
and D.O.T went forward
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
so it was a cost saver and that's where
 
05:31:10.850 --> 05:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
we're at and then all of a sudden 18
 
05:31:13.250 --> 05:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
months later it becomes an issue
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
and again I'm speaking as myself not as
 
05:31:17.208 --> 05:31:17.218 align:start position:0%
any other member of the Town Council I'm
 
05:31:20.930 --> 05:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
just saying the way I I see it
 
05:31:20.940 --> 05:31:21.708 align:start position:0%
just saying the way I I see it
um

05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:23.448 --> 05:31:23.458 align:start position:0%
and the contract doesn't spell out the
 
05:31:26.930 --> 05:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
bike path at all or the to me it's the
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
state's actually doing it for the town
 
05:31:30.650 --> 05:31:30.660 align:start position:0%
of dairy I think it's a it's a bonus for
 
05:31:30.660 --> 05:31:32.448 align:start position:0%
of dairy I think it's a it's a bonus for
us

05:31:32.448 --> 05:31:32.458 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:31:34.850 --> 05:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
um and as I said I don't I do not
 
05:31:36.170 --> 05:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
believe it should have come in front of
 
05:31:38.090 --> 05:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
the dairy Town Council there was some
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
discussion as to
 
05:31:43.010 --> 05:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh the the town basically thinking that
 
05:31:44.810 --> 05:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
it was going to get a tunnel for free if
 
05:31:47.390 --> 05:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
we pushed it on our on our end and
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's not the case
 
05:31:51.890 --> 05:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
well also was left out was you saw a
 
05:31:54.410 --> 05:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
letter from the drt's attorney who's it
 
05:31:56.690 --> 05:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
um but the town actually brought in its
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
own attorney its Town attorney
 
05:32:04.270 --> 05:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
and we got we got some counsel from them
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
saying that yes if we made any changes
 
05:32:09.288 --> 05:32:09.298 align:start position:0%
we could possibly be on the hook
 
05:32:12.288 --> 05:32:12.298 align:start position:0%
and everybody on the Town Council had
 
05:32:13.970 --> 05:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
made a promise to the taxpayers that
 
05:32:15.410 --> 05:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
five billion dollars would be it we're
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
not doing any more
 
05:32:19.550 --> 05:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
so when that time came up to vote in the
 
05:32:21.948 --> 05:32:21.958 align:start position:0%
Town Council we we voted to pass is
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
basically what we did we said it's up to
 
05:32:27.590 --> 05:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
the D.O.T and the state
 
05:32:27.600 --> 05:32:28.310 align:start position:0%
the D.O.T and the state
um

05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
and I think and again as representative
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
Abel Abel said uh I I actually spent
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
eight years on transportation and I
 
05:32:38.990 --> 05:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
think DOD does a fantastic job I watched
 
05:32:40.610 --> 05:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
the two other subcommittee meetings and
 
05:32:42.890 --> 05:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
I was a little bit upset because they
 
05:32:44.930 --> 05:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
they're portrayed as not doing the right
 
05:32:47.570 --> 05:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
thing and I think that that's incorrect
 
05:32:49.550 --> 05:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion I'm happy to answer
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.930 --> 05:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
questions for the gentleman from dairy
 
05:32:59.570 --> 05:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
05:32:59.580 --> 05:33:00.948 align:start position:0%
representative evil
so

05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:03.530 --> 05:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
um setting aside again the issue of the
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
finances it sounds like to the council
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
the potential for delay was of great
 
05:33:11.760 --> 05:33:13.310 align:start position:0%
the potential for delay was of great
concern

05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
concern
 
05:33:15.170 --> 05:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative absolutely
 
05:33:17.150 --> 05:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
because we've got Economic Development
 
05:33:19.550 --> 05:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
as well that will offshoot we have
 
05:33:22.368 --> 05:33:22.378 align:start position:0%
people in the waiting
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
um some lands off to the side that we
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
can develop
 
05:33:27.850 --> 05:33:27.860 align:start position:0%
um and as well my understanding is is
 
05:33:30.590 --> 05:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
Londonderry has lined up some economic
 
05:33:33.948 --> 05:33:33.958 align:start position:0%
development as well it's time sensitive
 
05:33:33.958 --> 05:33:35.570 align:start position:0%
development as well it's time sensitive
um

05:33:35.570 --> 05:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:37.070 --> 05:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing I don't know if was
 
05:33:39.650 --> 05:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
brought up to you at all but the
 
05:33:39.660 --> 05:33:41.628 align:start position:0%
brought up to you at all but the
landowner

05:33:41.628 --> 05:33:41.638 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
who is going to give the land to the
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
towns to to maintain on a legendary side
 
05:33:52.190 --> 05:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh for the bike path to connect is a
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
private landowner
 
05:33:57.650 --> 05:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
and that private landowner is also
 
05:34:01.250 --> 05:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
a developer on the Londonderry side
 
05:34:05.470 --> 05:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is is he's not really
 
05:34:08.448 --> 05:34:08.458 align:start position:0%
happy about AIDS old age
 
05:34:08.458 --> 05:34:09.650 align:start position:0%
happy about AIDS old age
so

05:34:09.650 --> 05:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:09.660 --> 05:34:11.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
again we still have to we still have to
 
05:34:14.930 --> 05:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
see if that landowner will give us the
 
05:34:17.330 --> 05:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
land because if he doesn't you could
 
05:34:22.010 --> 05:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.230 --> 05:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:27.240 --> 05:34:29.628 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:34:31.970 --> 05:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned your concern about the
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
delays and looking through the
 
05:34:36.288 --> 05:34:36.298 align:start position:0%
documentation that I've been given by
 
05:34:38.990 --> 05:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
the department and by the individuals in
 
05:34:40.368 --> 05:34:40.378 align:start position:0%
Dairy that are
 
05:34:42.830 --> 05:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the project this
 
05:34:46.250 --> 05:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
started in 1992 and we're still not
 
05:34:49.250 --> 05:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
breaking ground yet so
 
05:34:50.690 --> 05:34:50.700 align:start position:0%
what have been some of the delays
 
05:34:52.730 --> 05:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
because we heard that tunnel could delay
 
05:34:55.730 --> 05:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
at six months or a year but we're
 
05:34:58.970 --> 05:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
talking Decades of delay yeah that was
 
05:35:01.368 --> 05:35:01.378 align:start position:0%
mostly the financing side of things uh
 
05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
05:35:05.690 --> 05:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
um Senator Shaheen when she was a
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
governor actually put money into the
 
05:35:11.570 --> 05:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
into the project and somehow eventually
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
it was actually taken away you know it's
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
been a long long process
 
05:35:17.638 --> 05:35:18.170 align:start position:0%
been a long long process
um

05:35:18.170 --> 05:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is is you know
 
05:35:22.250 --> 05:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pinch myself that it's here
 
05:35:24.170 --> 05:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people from my town was
 
05:35:25.430 --> 05:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
like it's never going to happen never
 
05:35:30.250 --> 05:35:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:33.050 --> 05:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
right and from my standpoint I don't
 
05:35:35.690 --> 05:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
really have I use the rail trail I think
 
05:35:37.310 --> 05:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's great it's a great it's a great
 
05:35:39.110 --> 05:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
thing it's a great resource
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'll use it if it's a tunnel and I'll
 
05:35:44.110 --> 05:35:44.120 align:start position:0%
use it if it's a path for me
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
my main concern is dairy has been known
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
for high tax rates over the years we're
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting much better much much better
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
however we have 80 a mix of 80
 
05:35:58.490 --> 05:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
residential and 20 commercial we need to
 
05:36:01.070 --> 05:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
offset our residential taxes so economic
 
05:36:02.810 --> 05:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
development is really in the Forefront
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:36:05.930 --> 05:36:05.940 align:start position:0%
so this does two things we have new
 
05:36:08.330 --> 05:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
commercial development off of this exit
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
and then we can redevelop our downtown
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
which is old and need some Redevelopment
 
05:36:14.930 --> 05:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
we've got people that are interested to
 
05:36:17.150 --> 05:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
do some housing
 
05:36:18.890 --> 05:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
um so I'm kind of excited to see the
 
05:36:21.288 --> 05:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
project move forward I really don't want
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
to see delays because I've seen so many
 
05:36:24.530 --> 05:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
of them
 
05:36:24.540 --> 05:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
of them
but

05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:36:28.190 --> 05:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
so if we could make you King for the day
 
05:36:33.530 --> 05:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:33.540 --> 05:36:35.150 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:37.490 --> 05:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
with the tunnel be on your list if
 
05:36:39.288 --> 05:36:39.298 align:start position:0%
someone else paid for it other than the
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
well obviously if someone else is going
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
to give me a gift that I'm fine with
 
05:36:47.760 --> 05:36:49.430 align:start position:0%
to give me a gift that I'm fine with
that

05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:53.090 --> 05:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
um but if it's going to delay
 
05:36:55.250 --> 05:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
there's there's numbers on the other
 
05:36:56.990 --> 05:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
side of that you know
 
05:36:58.730 --> 05:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
um it's not just to clear whether you
 
05:37:00.530 --> 05:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
want the tunnel or not it's it's got the
 
05:37:02.990 --> 05:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
delay piece
 
05:37:05.810 --> 05:37:05.820 align:start position:0%
um which is a costly thing
 
05:37:08.208 --> 05:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
uh some of us spoke I believe to a
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative represented representing
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
the uh large development over in
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
Londonderry yeah that's Woodmont
 
05:37:18.948 --> 05:37:18.958 align:start position:0%
Woodmont Orchards and he pointed out
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
that the real Trill obviously would be
 
05:37:22.850 --> 05:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's good for them it's a selling point
 
05:37:25.670 --> 05:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
we heard from
 
05:37:28.250 --> 05:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
folks sit down in the Salem area that
 
05:37:31.610 --> 05:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
there's many as 166
 
05:37:34.190 --> 05:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
000 people that use this Corridor and of
 
05:37:36.650 --> 05:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
course as you know the corridor the plan
 
05:37:38.208 --> 05:37:38.218 align:start position:0%
is to connect it all the way to White
 
05:37:40.610 --> 05:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
River Junction or Lebanon so it's going
 
05:37:43.610 --> 05:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
to be a huge economic as already has
 
05:37:45.650 --> 05:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
been a huge economic development for
 
05:37:48.650 --> 05:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
that area so trying to get through this
 
05:37:50.690 --> 05:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
tunnel so to speak
 
05:37:52.368 --> 05:37:52.378 align:start position:0%
kind of puts a
 
05:37:54.708 --> 05:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
some icing on the cake because that's a
 
05:37:56.690 --> 05:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
little piece between Londonderry your
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
town and Salem it doesn't exist so just
 
05:38:03.230 --> 05:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
a little tidbit I did five terms as a
 
05:38:07.010 --> 05:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
State Rep here from 2010 to 2020. I was
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
named to be on a special committee I
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%
think it was SB 89
 
05:38:13.850 --> 05:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
it was me representative Sykes from
 
05:38:17.390 --> 05:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
transportation and Senator Stiles
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with rail trails
 
05:38:22.550 --> 05:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
so we spent over 12 different meetings
 
05:38:25.850 --> 05:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
talking about real Trails so I fully
 
05:38:27.530 --> 05:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
understand the concept
 
05:38:29.448 --> 05:38:29.458 align:start position:0%
I think it's great if we can connect all
 
05:38:30.770 --> 05:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
the way up to Lebanon I think it's a
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
major plus I think it is a benefit
 
05:38:37.490 --> 05:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
um the whole system is and it's very
 
05:38:39.650 --> 05:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
well used so I do admit that and I use
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:45.350 --> 05:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
well again I don't see any other further
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
comments I really appreciate you taking
 
05:38:51.288 --> 05:38:51.298 align:start position:0%
the time I appreciate it thank you yeah
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes sir I don't did you speak before to

05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%

05:39:12.770 --> 05:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:15.410 --> 05:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay there we go uh thank you very much
 
05:39:16.970 --> 05:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak I'm sorry I
 
05:39:18.770 --> 05:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
know you're winding down uh your
 
05:39:21.770 --> 05:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
testimony but um I was the chairman of
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
the dairy Town Council when we turned
 
05:39:25.850 --> 05:39:25.860 align:start position:0%
this project over to the Department of
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
Transportation so I I know a little bit
 
05:39:31.850 --> 05:39:31.860 align:start position:0%
about it I've followed the the project
 
05:39:35.230 --> 05:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
for over 25 years and
 
05:39:38.448 --> 05:39:38.458 align:start position:0%

thank you sir
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and so I have I've lived in Dairy for
 
05:39:49.550 --> 05:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
33 years I've followed the 4A project
 
05:39:51.890 --> 05:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
for 25 years and
 
05:39:54.410 --> 05:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
um sent numerous letters to the editor
 
05:39:57.470 --> 05:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
and all the other agencies and involved
 
05:39:59.448 --> 05:39:59.458 align:start position:0%
in this and as I said before I was
 
05:40:01.550 --> 05:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Town Council when we
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
turned this over to the dot dot approach
 
05:40:05.810 --> 05:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
to town and you know we agreed to do
 
05:40:07.550 --> 05:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
this and
 
05:40:10.010 --> 05:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
um you know the the owners of the of the
 
05:40:11.830 --> 05:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
property where the towns go is
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chuchello said I had spoken with him
 
05:40:18.650 --> 05:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
before we turned this over to to the dot
 
05:40:20.690 --> 05:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I said specifically what about the
 
05:40:23.448 --> 05:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
tunnel and he said the tunnel would be a
 
05:40:25.010 --> 05:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
part of that Tom don't worry about it
 
05:40:28.430 --> 05:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
and so we we have gone into this project
 
05:40:30.830 --> 05:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
all along that the town's going to be
 
05:40:32.990 --> 05:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
part of it and
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I know the the Town Council
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
voted they voted in favor of the
 
05:40:37.080 --> 05:40:38.690 align:start position:0%
voted they voted in favor of the
taxpayers

05:40:38.690 --> 05:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
05:40:41.750 --> 05:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
um to not pay for it uh if I had been on
 
05:40:43.550 --> 05:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
the Town Council at the time
 
05:40:46.250 --> 05:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
um my response would have been uh I
 
05:40:48.530 --> 05:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
would have sent the dot a letter saying
 
05:40:50.448 --> 05:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
no we are not interested in paying for
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
this this is an important part of our
 
05:40:56.448 --> 05:40:56.458 align:start position:0%
town and there's been numerous uh people
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
speaking in an outgrowing of support for
 
05:41:01.788 --> 05:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
the tunnel project
 
05:41:01.798 --> 05:41:03.948 align:start position:0%
the tunnel project
um

05:41:03.948 --> 05:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:07.190 --> 05:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know and that the whole reason that
 
05:41:09.230 --> 05:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the Town Council turned this
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
project over to the D.O.T was that we
 
05:41:14.330 --> 05:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get to a point where we
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
are now
 
05:41:18.050 --> 05:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
and there'd be more surprises more more
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
money costs that are going to be
 
05:41:20.930 --> 05:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
downshifted and that's basically what
 
05:41:23.448 --> 05:41:23.458 align:start position:0%
the the dot is doing their uh they're
 
05:41:23.458 --> 05:41:25.128 align:start position:0%
the the dot is doing their uh they're
downshifting

05:41:25.128 --> 05:41:25.138 align:start position:0%
downshifting
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
um they're downshifting their costs to
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy and it's it's really
 
05:41:30.650 --> 05:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
not fair uh one of the one of the things
 
05:41:33.288 --> 05:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
about the rail trail is it's really the
 
05:41:35.810 --> 05:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone for economic development in
 
05:41:38.570 --> 05:41:38.580 align:start position:0%
Dairy it runs through the downtown uh
 
05:41:40.368 --> 05:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
the rail trail has done a tremendous
 
05:41:41.868 --> 05:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
amount of work they spent a lot of money
 
05:41:43.448 --> 05:41:43.458 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of money
 
05:41:46.128 --> 05:41:46.138 align:start position:0%
to get it to a point like this and you
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be a destination for
 
05:41:50.448 --> 05:41:50.458 align:start position:0%
the downtown and you know in all honesty
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
the the people that use that rail trail
 
05:41:55.250 --> 05:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know they deserve an easy safe
 
05:41:57.890 --> 05:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
access and you know as a couple of you
 
05:41:59.810 --> 05:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
said before people aren't going to use
 
05:42:01.368 --> 05:42:01.378 align:start position:0%
the spaghetti path when they come to
 
05:42:03.288 --> 05:42:03.298 align:start position:0%
that they're going to go right over
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
right across those six Lanes of Highways
 
05:42:07.550 --> 05:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
05:42:10.128 --> 05:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
um that would be a big problem oh and
 
05:42:12.410 --> 05:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
also I just wanted to to very quickly
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
address the delays this project has been
 
05:42:18.708 --> 05:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
delayed for I mean I know go at least 15
 
05:42:18.718 --> 05:42:20.030 align:start position:0%
delayed for I mean I know go at least 15
years

05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:42:21.708 --> 05:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
um like I said I've followed it for many
 
05:42:24.550 --> 05:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
years it began in
 
05:42:27.770 --> 05:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
1985. I started following closely in the
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
mid 90s my daughter was in high school
 
05:42:33.230 --> 05:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
she is now 45 years old and her oldest
 
05:42:37.090 --> 05:42:37.100 align:start position:0%
son is in uh is in college so the laser
 
05:42:41.570 --> 05:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
delays are are been part of this project
 
05:42:43.550 --> 05:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years and
 
05:42:45.650 --> 05:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
especially cost overruns I mean think
 
05:42:49.730 --> 05:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
about it in 2000 in 1997 I attended the
 
05:42:51.288 --> 05:42:51.298 align:start position:0%
meeting when
 
05:42:53.868 --> 05:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
um when the Town Council approved the
 
05:42:55.250 --> 05:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
five million dollar Bond it was supposed
 
05:42:57.890 --> 05:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
to be 10 million dollars here we are
 
05:43:00.770 --> 05:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
um here we are today and I spoke with uh
 
05:43:02.690 --> 05:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
Wendy Johnson at the at the last meeting
 
05:43:04.850 --> 05:43:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I asked her how much the project was
 
05:43:06.890 --> 05:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
going to be and she said uh right now
 
05:43:10.190 --> 05:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's 112 million dollars and I said to
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
her I said well how much is it going to
 
05:43:14.150 --> 05:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
cost and she said I don't know and I
 
05:43:16.850 --> 05:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
responded to her I said well I know I
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
said I followed this project it goes up
 
05:43:21.050 --> 05:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
an average of four million dollars a
 
05:43:22.970 --> 05:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
year so you can use that as your
 
05:43:25.250 --> 05:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
Baseline and you know since since the
 
05:43:28.490 --> 05:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
Town Council turned this over to the dot
 
05:43:30.650 --> 05:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
the project has gone up
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know 50 to 53 million dollars
 
05:43:36.948 --> 05:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
05:43:39.050 --> 05:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much very good testimony
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for the history
 
05:43:43.310 --> 05:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
05:43:46.490 --> 05:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
yes uh what represents sweetie
 
05:43:49.010 --> 05:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
all right no problem
 
05:43:50.810 --> 05:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
yes I see the chairman of the Public
 
05:43:53.330 --> 05:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
Works committee back there and
 
05:43:55.788 --> 05:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
remind everybody where
 
05:43:58.910 --> 05:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
getting laid into the afternoon
 
05:44:04.970 --> 05:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.310 --> 05:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
and you have a hard name to spell so you
 
05:44:07.320 --> 05:44:10.010 align:start position:0%
and you have a hard name to spell so you
better

05:44:10.010 --> 05:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:13.250 --> 05:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
every time I sit in your chair I I think
 
05:44:14.930 --> 05:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
mines is probably the easiest that would
 
05:44:20.510 --> 05:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:23.570 --> 05:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
I have distinct pleasure of chairing uh
 
05:44:26.090 --> 05:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways I first came
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
here in 2020 I've served nine terms
 
05:44:33.530 --> 05:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
before that I had 10 years in the
 
05:44:35.868 --> 05:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission I was a
 
05:44:38.208 --> 05:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
member of the TAC and the tack is where
 
05:44:41.448 --> 05:44:41.458 align:start position:0%
as you know that's where all projects
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
start in the 10-year plan you're vetted
 
05:44:46.610 --> 05:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
in your area a project is scored moves
 
05:44:46.620 --> 05:44:47.530 align:start position:0%
in your area a project is scored moves
on

05:44:47.530 --> 05:44:47.540 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:44:51.410 --> 05:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
hearings are held by D.O.T moves on to
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
the executive Council they hear the
 
05:44:56.930 --> 05:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
proposals they rank them and then they
 
05:44:58.970 --> 05:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
land on our desk in public works next
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
year and then we we will go through
 
05:45:05.570 --> 05:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
there I was somewhat surprised
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill came through your
 
05:45:08.520 --> 05:45:09.610 align:start position:0%
that this bill came through your
committee

05:45:09.610 --> 05:45:09.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
and did not come through Public Works
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
and highways many of the items you're
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
struggling with we deal in a a daily uh
 
05:45:22.610 --> 05:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
yearly basis all the time one of our
 
05:45:24.650 --> 05:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
stars is sitting to my left over here
 
05:45:27.610 --> 05:45:27.620 align:start position:0%
that I served with for many years
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
I also started and financed a bike path
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
in my area I'm a little further north I
 
05:45:37.010 --> 05:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
will not propose to be the North country
 
05:45:39.350 --> 05:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
so I have great Sympathy for the people
 
05:45:41.208 --> 05:45:41.218 align:start position:0%
in the room here
 
05:45:43.970 --> 05:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
but the truth of the matter is if people
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
break the protocol people towns expand
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
the scope of a plan that was approved
 
05:45:52.490 --> 05:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
and in place
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then ask for in this case by the
 
05:45:58.730 --> 05:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
time you put the engineering cost and
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
the construction costs it's nearly a
 
05:46:04.670 --> 05:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars and every time they can
 
05:46:06.590 --> 05:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
circumvent the process and take a
 
05:46:08.810 --> 05:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
million dollars away there's a million
 
05:46:10.910 --> 05:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
dollars less that my little towns are
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
going to be able to find also so you
 
05:46:16.128 --> 05:46:16.138 align:start position:0%
folks have a tremendous chore in front
 
05:46:19.070 --> 05:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
of you I would probably propose to
 
05:46:19.080 --> 05:46:20.110 align:start position:0%
of you I would probably propose to
retain

05:46:20.110 --> 05:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
retain
 
05:46:23.570 --> 05:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
but I want to thank you for giving me
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak in front of you
 
05:46:27.708 --> 05:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
good to see you thank you are there any
 
05:46:31.490 --> 05:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
questions for the chair Public Works
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
so just one quick question for you folks
 
05:46:39.530 --> 05:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
at the D.O.T
 
05:46:44.208 --> 05:46:44.218 align:start position:0%
how many feet the Scenic Trail that you
 
05:46:46.610 --> 05:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
have going down along Shield Brook how
 
05:46:49.250 --> 05:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
many feet is that do you know off the
 
05:46:51.470 --> 05:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
top of your head because the town of
 
05:46:53.208 --> 05:46:53.218 align:start position:0%
dairy will have to maintain that right
 
05:46:56.090 --> 05:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
and the all the improvements like the
 
05:46:58.910 --> 05:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
bridges and signals that will all be the
 
05:47:00.590 --> 05:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the town of dairy is
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
that correct you're asking how along the
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
detour the additional distance this is
 
05:47:10.250 --> 05:47:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right uh yes sir if one more
 
05:47:15.530 --> 05:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
individual and then we've got to move
 
05:47:18.110 --> 05:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
along and make a decision one way or the
 
05:47:18.120 --> 05:47:21.590 align:start position:0%
along and make a decision one way or the
other

05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%

pictures that were taken on the real
 
05:47:38.520 --> 05:47:39.548 align:start position:0%
pictures that were taken on the real
Trail

05:47:39.548 --> 05:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
Trail
 
05:47:43.010 --> 05:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
basically showing the users
 
05:47:43.020 --> 05:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
basically showing the users
um

05:47:43.910 --> 05:47:43.920 align:start position:0%

families with bicycles you know that
 
05:47:51.708 --> 05:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
they pack up and they they bring the
 
05:47:56.208 --> 05:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
whole the whole family to the rail trail

05:48:57.170 --> 05:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
safe accessible transportation and
 
05:48:59.230 --> 05:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
Recreation for persons with disabilities
 
05:49:02.090 --> 05:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
led me to become involved in real Trail
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
issues some 20 years ago
 
05:49:06.890 --> 05:49:06.900 align:start position:0%
last week the Department of
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation assured you and again
 
05:49:11.208 --> 05:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
they assured you today thanks that the
 
05:49:12.830 --> 05:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
spaghetti plan provided a safe
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
alternative to the tunnel option and met
 
05:49:18.190 --> 05:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
all ADA requirements
 
05:49:20.930 --> 05:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
accessibilities is about more than
 
05:49:23.570 --> 05:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
compliance with standards
 
05:49:26.990 --> 05:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's about developing solutions to meet
 
05:49:29.930 --> 05:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
the needs of all users again all users
 
05:49:33.470 --> 05:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
here with and without disabilities
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
these Solutions are all components of
 
05:49:37.910 --> 05:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
Universal Design
 
05:49:40.910 --> 05:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
a concept now widely used in the private
 
05:49:44.090 --> 05:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
sector and provides a path for federal
 
05:49:48.410 --> 05:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
agencies to shift to this broader Focus
 
05:49:52.190 --> 05:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
Universal Design minimizes hazards and
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
the adverse consequences of accidental
 
05:49:57.948 --> 05:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
or unintended actions
 
05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
the spaghetti plan
 
05:50:02.570 --> 05:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:50:07.250 --> 05:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
three 90 degree turns on a downslope
 
05:50:09.770 --> 05:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
inadequate sight distances
 
05:50:11.990 --> 05:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
under a bridge
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
a 180 degree uh
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
button hook turn on a five degree slope
 
05:50:22.620 --> 05:50:23.990 align:start position:0%
button hook turn on a five degree slope
um

05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:28.490 --> 05:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's five percent grade for 550 feet
 
05:50:33.410 --> 05:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
almost two football fields without any
 
05:50:35.570 --> 05:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
areas for resting intervals at least
 
05:50:37.610 --> 05:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
that I saw
 
05:50:40.910 --> 05:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
then another five percent grade for 430
 
05:50:40.920 --> 05:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
then another five percent grade for 430
feet

05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
feet
 
05:50:46.368 --> 05:50:46.378 align:start position:0%
again without any resting intervals
 
05:50:49.310 --> 05:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
will not minimize hazards and the
 
05:50:51.890 --> 05:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
adverse consequences of accidental or
 
05:50:55.310 --> 05:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
unintended actions but rather increases
 
05:50:57.770 --> 05:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
the risk of those happening
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
and again I'll I'll refer to this
 
05:51:00.000 --> 05:51:01.510 align:start position:0%
and again I'll I'll refer to this
picture

05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
picture
 
05:51:06.410 --> 05:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
550 feet a person pedaling a tricycle
 
05:51:08.930 --> 05:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
with their arms
 
05:51:11.930 --> 05:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen
 
05:51:14.930 --> 05:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
you're just disenfranchising a huge
 
05:51:17.350 --> 05:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
portion of the population not only
 
05:51:20.390 --> 05:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
physically handicapped but also a lot of
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
the elderly are not going to be able to
 
05:51:25.010 --> 05:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
use this I know the the assistant
 
05:51:26.990 --> 05:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner said oh no I think it was
 
05:51:30.048 --> 05:51:30.058 align:start position:0%
the Town Council said that um he he
 
05:51:34.010 --> 05:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
would use both the tunnel and the uh in
 
05:51:36.048 --> 05:51:36.058 align:start position:0%
the spaghetti plan well I'm here to tell
 
05:51:38.090 --> 05:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
you I won't use a spaghetti plan because
 
05:51:40.010 --> 05:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
I can't
 
05:51:42.350 --> 05:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
um because of my medical conditions I
 
05:51:45.410 --> 05:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
will use the tunnel and that's why you
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
know real trails are so attractive to
 
05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
most people because of the one to two
 
05:51:51.288 --> 05:51:51.298 align:start position:0%
percent grade you throw in a five
 
05:51:54.770 --> 05:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
percent grade with all these issues
 
05:51:57.650 --> 05:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
you've got major problems major problems
 
05:52:00.288 --> 05:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
that are going to happen
 
05:52:00.298 --> 05:52:01.910 align:start position:0%
that are going to happen
um

05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
let's see the tunnel option with its two
 
05:52:07.970 --> 05:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
to three percent grade or less for a
 
05:52:10.310 --> 05:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
short distance
 
05:52:12.590 --> 05:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and again I'll refer back to last
 
05:52:12.600 --> 05:52:13.788 align:start position:0%
um and again I'll refer back to last
week

05:52:13.788 --> 05:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
week
 
05:52:13.798 --> 05:52:14.570 align:start position:0%
week
um

05:52:14.570 --> 05:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:18.288 --> 05:52:18.298 align:start position:0%
dot made the statement that the tunnel
 
05:52:20.390 --> 05:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
option also includes five percent grades
 
05:52:22.910 --> 05:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it does I think we have
 
05:52:25.670 --> 05:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
plans that show that it doesn't
 
05:52:28.250 --> 05:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
um so that's a misnomer
 
05:52:31.070 --> 05:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the tunnel will be usable by all
 
05:52:33.410 --> 05:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
people to the greatest extent possible
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
without the need for add that patient A
 
05:52:38.330 --> 05:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
specialized design
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%

05:52:45.288 --> 05:52:45.298 align:start position:0%
recreation organization based out of the
 
05:52:47.090 --> 05:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire
 
05:52:49.730 --> 05:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
supported the tunnel option in a letter
 
05:52:52.430 --> 05:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
to the Derry Town Town Council which I I
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was handed out dated
 
05:52:57.590 --> 05:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
December 19th they stated that the
 
05:53:00.770 --> 05:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
tunnel favors Universal Design and will
 
05:53:03.708 --> 05:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
always advocate in supporting the use of
 
05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
these projects for people of all
 
05:53:05.878 --> 05:53:08.628 align:start position:0%
these projects for people of all
abilities

05:53:08.628 --> 05:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.970 --> 05:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
this organization uses the Wyndham
 
05:53:13.610 --> 05:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
section of the Granite State Rail Trail
 
05:53:13.620 --> 05:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
section of the Granite State Rail Trail
because

05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:53:18.470 --> 05:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
um bringing with them an assortment of
 
05:53:21.530 --> 05:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
adapted to Cycles Recumbent Trikes
 
05:53:24.048 --> 05:53:24.058 align:start position:0%
tandem cycles and a hand cycle like like
 
05:53:26.930 --> 05:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
is pictured here specifically because of
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
the real Trails gentle raid
 
05:53:31.730 --> 05:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
in closing the Department of
 
05:53:33.470 --> 05:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation has a chance to do the
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
right thing right from the get-go
 
05:53:39.048 --> 05:53:39.058 align:start position:0%
by building the tunnel
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
option which meets the needs of all
 
05:53:44.090 --> 05:53:44.100 align:start position:0%
people that is accessible usable
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
convenient and a pleasure to use I
 
05:53:49.368 --> 05:53:49.378 align:start position:0%
believe building
 
05:53:51.288 --> 05:53:51.298 align:start position:0%
the spaghetti option
 
05:53:53.750 --> 05:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
will result in a stain on the New
 
05:53:55.610 --> 05:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department's well-earned

05:54:02.208 --> 05:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
top-notch infrastructure projects thank
 
05:54:02.218 --> 05:54:04.190 align:start position:0%
top-notch infrastructure projects thank
you

05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:54:06.110 --> 05:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:54:09.650 --> 05:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh was it Morris right correct any
 
05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.010 --> 05:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
05:54:16.020 --> 05:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
much

05:54:17.510 --> 05:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.430 --> 05:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
any thoughts the division have any
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
thoughts and what we'd like to do with
 
05:54:28.970 --> 05:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
this yes representative Sweeney thank
 
05:54:31.788 --> 05:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I think I can say at
 
05:54:34.490 --> 05:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
this point I'm not sure where I would go
 
05:54:37.310 --> 05:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
on the legislature I I would amend it to
 
05:54:39.230 --> 05:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
get rid of the misdemeanor but I think
 
05:54:43.250 --> 05:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
the overar the underlying legislation uh
 
05:54:44.750 --> 05:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
05:54:46.850 --> 05:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
no pun intended but where the best path
 
05:54:52.010 --> 05:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
is for for this I'd be happy to offer
 
05:54:54.470 --> 05:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
time working on it
 
05:54:57.770 --> 05:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh retain the bill and
 
05:55:00.110 --> 05:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
well I don't I don't know if retaining
 
05:55:02.030 --> 05:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
makes sense if that's just going to push
 
05:55:04.430 --> 05:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
it out and we actually we don't have to
 
05:55:06.590 --> 05:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
make a decision today we could say let's
 
05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
meet next week get more information
 
05:55:10.730 --> 05:55:10.740 align:start position:0%
maybe all the members would like to go
 
05:55:13.128 --> 05:55:13.138 align:start position:0%
down to the site could do that too and
 
05:55:14.750 --> 05:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
only push out a week or something
 
05:55:16.610 --> 05:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
special another hearing I think that
 
05:55:18.110 --> 05:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense just so that we can make
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
sure everybody that wants to be heard
 
05:55:21.830 --> 05:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to be heard on this great
 
05:55:21.840 --> 05:55:26.628 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to be heard on this great
suggestion

05:55:26.628 --> 05:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
would you uh we're we're actually
 
05:55:31.250 --> 05:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
discussing a procedure so we're not
 
05:55:32.750 --> 05:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to take any further testimony
 
05:55:34.250 --> 05:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
point out that there's people that did
 
05:55:35.930 --> 05:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
take time off of work to come here at
 
05:55:37.250 --> 05:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
your request and there's only a couple
 
05:55:38.390 --> 05:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
of them I was wondering if you give them
 
05:55:39.708 --> 05:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
each three minutes for those that want
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
05:55:41.520 --> 05:55:44.930 align:start position:0%
to speak
um

05:55:44.930 --> 05:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
well I I think we're going to have
 
05:55:49.610 --> 05:55:49.620 align:start position:0%
another meeting it's it's getting late
 
05:55:49.620 --> 05:55:50.330 align:start position:0%
another meeting it's it's getting late
um

05:55:50.330 --> 05:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:53.570 --> 05:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
in all fairness to everybody uh I
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
apologize for any of you that have come
 
05:55:57.708 --> 05:55:57.718 align:start position:0%
a long distance but I believe
 
05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney's suggestions are
 
05:56:02.868 --> 05:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
good we need more information hopefully
 
05:56:05.208 --> 05:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
we'll get it and if anyone wishes to
 
05:56:07.910 --> 05:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
come in a week they can so is that
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
you're okay with that
 
05:56:14.868 --> 05:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
I I share uh representative Sweeney's
 
05:56:18.170 --> 05:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts on this as far as I'm not
 
05:56:20.270 --> 05:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
really ready to make a decision on it
 
05:56:23.628 --> 05:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of things on both sides
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the issue here today
 
05:56:28.850 --> 05:56:28.860 align:start position:0%
what I haven't heard is a clear
 
05:56:28.860 --> 05:56:31.128 align:start position:0%
what I haven't heard is a clear
Unified

05:56:31.128 --> 05:56:31.138 align:start position:0%
Unified
 
05:56:31.138 --> 05:56:34.010 align:start position:0%
Unified
decision

05:56:34.010 --> 05:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:56:36.730 --> 05:56:36.740 align:start position:0%
from the dairy Council
 
05:56:39.048 --> 05:56:39.058 align:start position:0%
and it's really
 
05:56:41.930 --> 05:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
we're sitting up here in Concord
 
05:56:45.048 --> 05:56:45.058 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we should be making
 
05:56:48.230 --> 05:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
decisions for the town may have their
 
05:56:49.548 --> 05:56:49.558 align:start position:0%
own just they have their own
 
05:56:52.250 --> 05:56:52.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives they'd entered into a
 
05:56:52.260 --> 05:56:53.628 align:start position:0%
Representatives they'd entered into a
contract

05:56:53.628 --> 05:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
contract
 
05:56:56.030 --> 05:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
with the DOT
 
05:56:59.750 --> 05:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
and shot of uh you know a clear
 
05:57:02.830 --> 05:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
message from the Town Council
 
05:57:08.930 --> 05:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.910 --> 05:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to comment
 
05:57:13.788 --> 05:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you very much
 
05:57:16.128 --> 05:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just want to follow up on
 
05:57:19.128 --> 05:57:19.138 align:start position:0%
what representative Griffin said I think
 
05:57:21.788 --> 05:57:21.798 align:start position:0%
that it's very difficult
 
05:57:25.490 --> 05:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
for a legislative body to come into the
 
05:57:27.530 --> 05:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
middle of a project that's had so much
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
discussion and as much fact-finding as
 
05:57:30.240 --> 05:57:31.368 align:start position:0%
discussion and as much fact-finding as
we

05:57:31.368 --> 05:57:31.378 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:57:33.530 --> 05:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
try to do
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
one of the difficulties of being in a
 
05:57:39.288 --> 05:57:39.298 align:start position:0%
position like this is that you can never
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
fully satisfy yourself I I just there's
 
05:57:46.070 --> 05:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
just too much I am struck by the
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
September 26
 
05:57:52.970 --> 05:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
2022 letter from David Karen to Dot
 
05:57:55.070 --> 05:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
and it says right here is previously
 
05:57:57.410 --> 05:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
stated by our elected officials here in
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
Derry We Believe Dot's plan to provide
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
safe Passage through the corridor by
 
05:58:05.330 --> 05:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
means of a shared use pathway is an
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
efficient reasonable and rational basis
 
05:58:09.708 --> 05:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
of all stakeholders associated with the
 
05:58:09.718 --> 05:58:10.810 align:start position:0%
of all stakeholders associated with the
project

05:58:10.810 --> 05:58:10.820 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:58:13.610 --> 05:58:13.620 align:start position:0%
I think that's a pretty clear statement
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
they met again in January they had
 
05:58:19.610 --> 05:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
everything presented again they didn't
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
change their position and as one who's
 
05:58:26.510 --> 05:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
pretty interested in local control I for
 
05:58:30.490 --> 05:58:30.500 align:start position:0%
one would be really uncomfortable
 
05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
stepping on the toes of the town of
 
05:58:40.330 --> 05:58:40.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:44.628 --> 05:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
rhc yes representative Kimbrell's yes I
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
had to representative Sweeney's Point
 
05:58:49.610 --> 05:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that there's no Mal
 
05:58:51.650 --> 05:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
intent on either side of the parties
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
here and for that reason I would want to
 
05:58:56.048 --> 05:58:56.058 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment to
 
05:58:59.390 --> 05:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate the misdemeanor Char charges
 
05:59:00.650 --> 05:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:59:00.660 --> 05:59:02.890 align:start position:0%
all right
Instagram

05:59:02.890 --> 05:59:02.900 align:start position:0%
Instagram
 
05:59:06.170 --> 05:59:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt sure
 
05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
I want to repeat something I said about
 
05:59:12.110 --> 05:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
a previous bill
 
05:59:15.770 --> 05:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
I frankly don't understand the uh the
 
05:59:18.350 --> 05:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
process including of the finance
 
05:59:20.390 --> 05:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee deciding whether what is going
 
05:59:22.190 --> 05:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
to be billed and what is not going to be
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
built sorry uh and uh in addition to
 
05:59:28.788 --> 05:59:28.798 align:start position:0%
that I've been reading through some of
 
05:59:31.490 --> 05:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
these things and it it occurs to me that
 
05:59:33.288 --> 05:59:33.298 align:start position:0%
there have been some decisions made and
 
05:59:36.048 --> 05:59:36.058 align:start position:0%
some for example this contract that was
 
05:59:39.110 --> 05:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
made between the uh between the towns
 
05:59:41.990 --> 05:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Transportation
 
05:59:44.030 --> 05:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh which
 
05:59:47.810 --> 05:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
cast some on on unusual light on this
 
05:59:52.250 --> 05:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
situation uh the the contract was uh
 
05:59:54.170 --> 05:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
signed by everybody and also approved by
 
05:59:55.850 --> 05:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General governor and
 
05:59:55.860 --> 05:59:56.810 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General governor and
Council

05:59:56.810 --> 05:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
Council
 
05:59:56.820 --> 05:59:58.190 align:start position:0%
Council
and

05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:00:01.250 --> 06:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
I don't see where where we have the the
 
06:00:04.010 --> 06:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
right to decide which process is going
 
06:00:06.530 --> 06:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
to be used I'm not saying I'm not saying
 
06:00:08.090 --> 06:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
that you can't I'm saying that this is a
 
06:00:10.850 --> 06:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
situation where we really should not
 
06:00:13.128 --> 06:00:13.138 align:start position:0%
make any decisions until we've had an
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to look at all the facts
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the information that's been provided
 
06:00:19.730 --> 06:00:19.740 align:start position:0%

06:00:21.170 --> 06:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
chance to read

06:00:26.770 --> 06:00:26.780 align:start position:0%
