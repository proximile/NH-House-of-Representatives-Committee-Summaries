orientation welcome Mr Shay
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
good morning chisay from the legislative
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
budget Assistance office um everybody
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
should have before them a tan sleeve and
 
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
in that sleeve you should have three
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
documents should have the what we have
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
referred to as the
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
catalog you should have a bond offering
 
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
statement and then you'll have our
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
presentation on top of that you should
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
have the governor's recommended capital
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
budget your name should be on that in
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
bottom corner so that don't get confused
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
and share it with somebody else by
 
00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.350 align:start position:0%
and share it with somebody else by

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
accident
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
um and I'll touch up on all these
 
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
documents as I go along and and I'm
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
going to be brief because the treasure
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
is um supposed to be here at 11 o'clock
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
so and you don't want to listen to me
 
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
for too too long so the purpose of the
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
document that's got LBA and big letters
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
on it and the capital budget orientation
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
is it's basically meant to be a One-Stop
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
shop for you if you're interested in
 
00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
knowing different aspects um and we just
 
00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
to start when you flip the page um on
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
the back side of the cover is contact
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
information so my name's there my
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
telephone number and my email and it
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's also a link and that's to our
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
web page the LBA web page where all the
 
00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
capital project documents will be
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
located um as agencies come and present
 
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
to you and we hand you a piece of paper
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
from the agency that paper will be um
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
stored on our web page so that you can
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
access that um when you're not wanting
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
to look at the paper or you don't have
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
you the next page is the table of
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
contents it gives you just a very um
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
brief overview of what's contained in
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
the document you got the capital budget
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
statutes um the overview of the capital
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
budget process we throw in a docket for
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
the capital um budget for House Bill
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
25 um there's a compare report which our
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
office prepares um and then the house
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
bill 25 is adopted and then um a couple
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
of pieces of uh some some minor changes
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
that occurred this last operating uh
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
um that I'll just draw your attention
 
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
to so I'm not going to go through the
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
statutes I mean again that's the reason
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
I show you that this is how or drives
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
what happens with the capital budget so
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
that that tells when um the process
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
should start what types of things should
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
be included um it's not just
 
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
administrative Services there are things
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
like CTE from the Department of
 
00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
Education and there's a statute that
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
guides how they submit that for the
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
capital budget and how much of that they
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
put in there
 
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
but if I could move you to um
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
page nine of the document it's going to
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
process so this process starts almost a
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
year ago the agency start thinking about
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
what they would like to do for Capital
 
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
Improvements or capital projects within
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
their agency and then they submit um by
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
May 1st uh their list to the governor's
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
office or to administrative services for
 
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
them then um to be developed into a
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
compiled list of all the agencies that
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
the governor will have for um their
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
presentations um in June so there's the
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget presentations in June of
 
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
capital budget presentations in June of
a

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
year from there so the and there's a
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
summary in this document that you know
 
00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's was close to $700 Million worth
 
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
of capital projects actually more than
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
that because almost 600 was the um
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
prison um of projects that the agency's
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
asked for it's a major wish list it's
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
everything they could potentially need
 
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
money for once the governor has their
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
hearings they work with the public works
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee and some of their people to
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
determine which projects the agency's
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
presented should be further reviewed um
 
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.909 align:start position:0%
presented should be further reviewed um
and

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
submitted in the catalog so this this
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
trims down the numbers that were
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
presented in June and from here the
 
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
governor May pick some of these projects
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
to present in the pink document to you
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean that a project
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
that is in the pink document was in the
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
catalog that it's not binding in any way
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
but the um items in the catalog have a
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
lot more detail behind them than what
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
you actually see in the catalog so that
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
U Department of administrative services
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
division of Public Works Works through
 
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
these projects works with the agencies
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
and comes up with cost estimates and
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's where they get some of the
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
numbers and sometimes the numbers that
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
you might see that come from the catalog
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
and then an agency brings in something
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
that they had done earlier than that
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
might be different and that's part of
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
the reason is that there's some costs
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
that um administrative Services Public
 
00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
Works will'll try to update and and try
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
to get you to the most um current
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
information to have before
 
00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
you then February 15th the governor by
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
February 15th the governor needs to hand
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
her budget over to the legislature and
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
then it comes in this case to the house
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
so the pink document is the governor
 
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.790 align:start position:0%
so the pink document is the governor
aot's

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
aot's
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation if you pick up the pink
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
document for just a moment and you flip
 
00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
page so these are the agencies that um
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
have a project recommended by her and
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
what you have there is the total
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
funds and then the general fund portion
 
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
in this case there's a the governor is
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
recommending $143 million in general
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
fund Capital Appropriations for members
 
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
of this committee who have been on this
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past um you've often
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
talked about a number between 120 and
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
125 um so just so you know it's it's up
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit from what you typically see
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh I suspect the treasurer will speak to
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
well so the this committee will go
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
process um recommend a capital budget to
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
the Full House the house will accept
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
that potentially and if they do it would
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and the process would
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
start all over again Senate would pass a
 
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget potentially it would come
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
back to the house to consider if they
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
made any
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
changes a committee of conference may be
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
asked for at that point and at their
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference uh selected
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
members of uh this committee and of the
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
Senate capital budget committee would
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
meet in a committee of conference to
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
iron out any differences and from there
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
it would be passed to the governor to
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
sign off and and put into law
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
potentially so that's the process um
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of June this is all
 
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:02.550 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of June this is all
done

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
maybe if you flip to page 11 it's going
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
to it's going to look like this this is
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
the compare sheet that I put together
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
for this committee so I'll take all the
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
projects that the governor has
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
recommended in her budget I'll put it on
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
the list there'll be a column that's um
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
blank that has the house decisions each
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
one of you will get as we start to meet
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
with agencies I'll provide this to you
 
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
so next week when agencies start coming
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
in to present to you their Capital um
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
project ideas and what they would like
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
you to fund for them you'll be able to
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
keep tab on you know what decisions this
 
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
committee might make I will update the
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
document um at the end of each meeting
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
if any decisions are made
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
and at the next meeting provide the
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
updated version but as well it will be
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
177 that is the house bill 25 that was
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
signed into law in
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
2023 so if you were interested in what
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
was done the last capital budget you
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
have that document here if you look on
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
page 18 you're going to see a
 
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
highlight on row 22 and
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
23 it's related to the winnisquam
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
regional CTE
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
Center so what happened there is that in
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 there was language put in
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
to say fund this project through the
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund don't bond it
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
because the capital budget had already
 
00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:43.030 align:start position:0%
because the capital budget had already
moved

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
moved
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
forward um they put um language in House
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that was contingency that
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
basically said if this house bill 25
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
gets adopted don't fund it with capital
 
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:54.519 align:start position:0%
appropriation use the education trust
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
41 and 42 you'll see again some shaded
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
areas that's where the CTE were funded
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
this last operating uh this last budget
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
cycle um again for members who are
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
returning most years the CTE are funded
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
through the capital
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
budget the 2023 House Bill 25 was the
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
first time it wasn't funded through
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
there it was funded directly with the
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
educ ation trust fund
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations this time if you look in
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended the CTE is
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
back in there so it looks to be uh being
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
asked as a capital appropriation this
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
time and rightly so since the education
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund um probably couldn't support
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
and then going on for the next couple
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
Pages these would be all the um requests
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
that were made back in June at the
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget hearing so
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
each agency and how much they were
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
asking for uh was 1.1 billion in general
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
funds so I was I cut that short and the
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections was the
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
largest number they had 707 million but
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
just over 600 million was related to uh
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%
so the detail follows that for a couple
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
of pages um and then the last two pages
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
is basically uh just the rsas related to
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
the uh Capital project overview
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee and the long range Capital
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
planning utilization committee and I
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
only put them there because um some of
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
you may be appointed to that committee
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
and it just tells you how you got on
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
there you know it's very specific that
 
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
several Public Works members get
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
appointed to the capital project
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
Capital so that is just taking you
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
through that document ra rather quickly
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
um if there's any questions I'll take a
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
pause here but then I'll move on from
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
there I just have I just have one and uh
 
00:15:27.749 --> 00:15:27.759 align:start position:0%
pardon me I don't have it in front of me
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
here I know we have a CT school I think
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's I guess my question is do we have a
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
backup CTE School in case they can't
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
come up with their part of the funding
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
we've had it in the past so they've only
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
they only have the one listed in the
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
capital um budget recommendation I don't
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
know if there's so let me back up the
 
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education keeps a list of
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
the CTE and when they're due to be
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
considered for a capital appropriation I
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what the status of the list
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
is in terms of you know the entity after
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
the one that's in this budget where they
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
approached and where they can you know
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
asked if they would be able to pass it
 
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
locally if they had to that would be a
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
question I'd have to follow up with doe
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
on do we know if Jeffrey ringe has got
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
we don't know I don't know yet if
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
there's been approval in locally for
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
that or if it's just a placeholder with
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
anticipation for approval but I I can
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
ask the agency I think they're due to
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
see you next week right I can ask them
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
to be ready to respond to that when they
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
come before commissioner Ed bluk going
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
to be here or did he uh I don't believe
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
he's going to come into that meeting uh
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
I believe it's going to be uh Melissa
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
white who's the director of one of the
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
areas and then uh Mr beard who runs the
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
CTE program I know that that one two
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
banum we had uh we had that ball through
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
twice yep yeah okay um aside from that I
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any questions
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh anyway yes representative Brown thank
 
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just for clarification
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
again I'm new to this so I want to make
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
sure I understood what you were speaking
 
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
about on the page 40 in regard to the uh
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education CTE renovation
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
projects you said that those projects
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
were previously approved under this
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
committee's budget before am I correct
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
but the governor has now taken these
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
projects and put in her capital budget
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
under the education trust f I just need
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
a clarification no so in in developing
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
the 2023 capital budget for 25 and 20
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me 24 and 25 um fiscal years the
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
CTE was in the um proposed oper capital
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
budget during the process of the
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
building the operating budget a decision
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
was made to take them out of the um
 
00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:50.710 align:start position:0%
was made to take them out of the um
capital

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
budget and put it into the operating
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
budget there was two CTE projects last
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
time one was in the capital and one
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
ended up in the um House Bill 2
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
the decision was to just fund both
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
projects through House Bill 2 so
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
essentially they took cash out of the
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to pay for the CTE
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
projects instead of bonding
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
them what this Governor has proposed is
 
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
to go back to what has been the norm in
 
00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
is to bond a capital appropriation for a
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
CTE thank you for that clarification
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you Mr chairman uh coming
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
back to the uh page 43 where there's a
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
billion something dollars in requests
 
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.029 align:start position:0%
billion something dollars in requests
isn't

00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
that am I remembering we want the
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
agencies to ask for everything they
 
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
might possibly want and then prune from
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
there because sometimes you will see the
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
Press saying these Big Spenders want to
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
spend a billion dollars on what but
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we ask them to do so that's
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
what the capital budget process does it
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
says agencies give us everything so that
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
the governor can consider that that's
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
what this page 40 uh3 is it's all
 
00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
everything that the agencies thought
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
that they might need at that time
 
00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.909 align:start position:0%
that they might need at that time
obviously

00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
68 months later new ideas might come up
 
00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
or new issues may come up and so you you
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
may have to Pivot to address different
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
Capital issues but it gives you a sense
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
of what agencies might be asking
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
for they may not um get them this cycle
 
00:19:14.909 --> 00:19:14.919 align:start position:0%
but maybe a heads up as to what you
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
well Chris so then our big thick book
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
should have the 1.1 billion just have
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
less than that it'll have less but but
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
it'll be close takes the 1.1 billion of
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
projects and the governor and their team
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
looked at and said okay here's projects
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
we would consider for a capital budget
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
okay so it's going to be less than that
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and then it comes down after that
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
then it comes down into our little pink
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
book which is what we'll be working off
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
of what this what this actually does and
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen that frequently but
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
when we're in our and I'm going to call
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
it the pink book for clarification a for
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
right now will come up and the
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections will only have
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
one item for something but when we go to
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
our binder you'll find out that
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections will have four
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
or five different
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
requests and
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
frequently occasionally they'll come in
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
and say look the governor approved this
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
this $2 million for this project we have
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
three other smaller projects that add up
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
to 2 million we'd like to change that
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
right now that's the purview of this
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee we can go ahead and do that
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we get both both books with
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
us so and just for clarification the
 
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
when the agencies came to the governor
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
they asked for
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
1.1 billion dollars worth of projects
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
the catalog
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
has 400 just over $400 million in
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
general fund projects so you can see
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
it's been whittel down and then what
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
ended up in here is $143 Million worth
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
projects thank you for that matter of
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
fact I just labeled this as my catalog
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
so I don't forget what to call it this
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
is the catalog this is still the pink
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
one and the store so the the white
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
document is the bond offering statement
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
from last
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
April and I just wanted members to have
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that it's broken into two parts it's
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
part one and part two so part one would
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
be dealing with the bond and explaining
 
00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
what the state's trying to do there part
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
two is the demographic statistical
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
information that's the more in my
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
opinion I don't know if the treasure is
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
behind me yet but uh that's the more
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
interesting part of
 
00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:47.870 align:start position:0%
interesting part of
it

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the the second part I mean you're
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
going to find information on
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
demographics you're going to find County
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
information you're going to find you
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
just a wealth of information in there
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
including talking about the previous
 
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
capital budget and some of the items
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
related to that um but it's I think it's
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
a great resource I just wanted to make
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of it um so that
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I had
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
there other other than that I there's
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
not a lot I have to say um just a couple
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
of quick things Canon Mountain it was a
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
um appropriation for the
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
Tramway last uh last operating budget of
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
$18 million you're going to see in this
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
pink document there's a $20 million
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
request for the Tramway at Canon
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
Mountain the uh Governor aot is
 
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.310 align:start position:0%
Mountain the uh Governor aot is
recommending

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
recommending
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
to close out the $18 million that was
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
appropriated to um Department of Natural
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
and cultur resources for the Tramway so
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
that that money can be used to help
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
balance the budget and then has put it
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
in here for $20
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
million if for those of you that um have
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
been around you you've heard the
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
department mention in in within the last
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
year that when they went out to bid it
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
was closer to
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
3233 million to do the Tramway they were
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
going to be be looking at um the the
 
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
structural arms that hold the Tramway
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
and having some um Engineers come in to
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that those were sound because
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
I think the 33 or $32 million potential
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
cost was including taking those all down
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
um and the company that would provide
 
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
the trim didn't want to rely on the fact
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
that these might be old and could break
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
if they put their new equipment on it um
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
but that would be a question when they
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
come before you to really understand
 
00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the Tramway and
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
what what's $20 million going to
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
buy and you got rid of the 18 so I just
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the committee aware of
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
that um would you you also uh walk the
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
committee through that came up back in
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
the long range Capital planning uh the
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh status of the prison the $40 million
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
why it's why we don't see anything in
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
there so the right now there's a $50
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
million appropriated to the Department
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
of Corrections to look at um a new
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
prison um they're using those funds to
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
assess the land behind the current
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
prison to see if they can um put the
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
Men's prison there right now they have
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
the women's prison that was put there
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
most recently um there's a lot of ledge
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
and a lot of other things that go on and
 
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
so they wanted to um take a look at that
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
land U make sure it was could support a
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
new Men's prison um as well as that Ed B
 
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
the bounce of the funds to do the uh
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
structural and Architectural um designs
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
that they could use to go out to bid
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
with so the question had come up at the
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
at a previous meeting is why isn't there
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
anything in house in the capital budget
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
proposal for the prisons a new prison um
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
I think and I suggest this and it may
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
will need to be followed up with
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks when she comes before
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
you but I think they may not need the
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
money in the next two years because of
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
the work they're doing to get ready to
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
put something out to bid it may be
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
needed at a later point also um last
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
spring the treasurer came before you and
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
talked about you may want to consider
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
this project differently than you do
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
other capital projects it may not be
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
something you put in House Bill 25 but
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a speal separate
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislative special that um puts the
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the new prison but
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
maybe staggers the appropriation out to
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
kind of go along with what the need
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
might be for the build so that you don't
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate $400 million all at once
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
maybe you do something slightly less in
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
the first couple years and then
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
depending on how long the project takes
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
but so there's some different ways of
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
looking at this and I don't want to
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that this is the only way but
 
00:25:54.389 --> 00:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a conversation that was
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
had with this committee that U because
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
it is such a large project it maybe need
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
to be looked at a little bit differently
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
when it does come time to fully
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate it I believe the commit the
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
commitment to the prisons was $40
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
million a year for 10 years and we've
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
given them 40 actually 50 so far 50 uh
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
so I when I talked to Ken Wier at
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
Finance he said well we made that
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
commitment for 10 years but we didn't
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that it was going to be
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
10 years in a row so
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
so that's why this year you're not going
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
to see 40 million in there for uh for
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
the prison but the commitment is still
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
there any anything else any questions
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
for Mr Shay Mr chairman yes represent
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a question do you
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
know have any idea has the Department of
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
Corrections told you or given you any
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
hint about when the design work for the
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
new prison Men's prison would be done uh
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
no no that I haven't had any direct
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
conversations related to that and again
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
that would would be um under your
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
purview when they come in um that they
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
definitely would I would suggest to the
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
committee that you ask them questions
 
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
about what's going on with the the
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
prison the potential for a new prison
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
particularly as you consider what types
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
of projects they're asking for in the
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
capital budget and what they might need
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
in the short term to um allow the Men's
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
prison to continue to operate in in a in
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
a way that's safe and and uh um
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
productive for the officers and the
 
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.310 align:start position:0%
productive for the officers and the
inmates

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
inmates
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
um yes I don't have anything in
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
particular representative clud here
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%

make the decisions you have to make in
this

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative kazinski as a
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
reminder I think um that 50 million for
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
the corrections also included uh some
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
million representative
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
Boger yeah if I could um thank you for
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
allowing my question and thank you for
 
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question it goes back to the
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
dramway where we had 16
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
million allocated I guess through a bond
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
for that project and now we want
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
to move that it was a cash
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation so that there was Cash
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
being appropriated towards that project
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
of $18
 
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
million the governor has um decided that
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
in order to make the budget work she
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
needs that cash in uh 2026 so there's a
 
00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
language potentially in House Bill 2 or
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill that will um basically
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
lapse the remaining
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
amount to the general fund and then in
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
this oper in the capital budget the
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to provide $20 million
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
Tramway thank
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Mr
 
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
Shay Madam Treasurer you are up
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
next and before that I'd like to just
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
say the reason we have the treasure here
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
all the time is there's a there's lots
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
of bonding money to be done here as as a
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
general rule we look to the treasurer to
 
00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:39.519 align:start position:0%
get us a figure that we can adhere
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
to whatever that figure is as a as a
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
guideline this committee has normally
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
tried to cut it by about $10
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
million as a general room we do that
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
only because after we pass this budget
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the Senate
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
the reason 24 Senators got voted in
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
instead of 400 Representatives is those
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
24 Senators have made many promises to
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
their areas and they need about they're
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
going to add about 10 million to it
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
which is why they'll pass their version
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
of the budget and then we'll finally
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
bang it out in a committee of conference
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
but it all
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
starts with Madam Treasurer who will
 
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.269 align:start position:0%
starts with Madam Treasurer who will
give

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
us a figure and I noticed the governor's
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
fig figure is at around 143 million and
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
in past I would guess for the past four
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
to six years we've been working between
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
1 120 and
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
130 so Madam Treasurer you're you're on
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
everyone um for the record State
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
Treasurer Monica mapelli and thank you
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
again for inviting me today um so I know
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
you have a difficult task to try to uh
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
fund coupal projects and we usually know
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of requests uh that come
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
before the governor and and to you but
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh what I would like to just
 
00:31:08.509 --> 00:31:08.519 align:start position:0%
provide you an overview of um obviously
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
some of uh or all of most of the most of
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
the projects are bonded um so um what I
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
would like to share is is how we see
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
things um you know from perspective of
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
the treasury when we are ready to is to
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
to issue bonds to fund those projects um
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
so um I'll try to say at a high level
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
but this presentation has essentially
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
what we what we look at our data
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
affordability so um I'll start with um
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know why we look at our data
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
affordability and is is primarily
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
because um B the boring costs are are
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
driven by the credit rating that uh
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
rating agencies uh assigned to the state
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
so um they look at um a variety of um
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
elements of of um
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
components of of the city of New
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the economy they look at
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
the financial condition of our state our
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
operating results and the spite of that
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
obviously they they want to uh review
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
how um you know if we're able to issue a
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
balance budget or you know the type of
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
revenues that we have are they diverse
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh in case one of them doesn't uh
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
perform well they want to make sure
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
there's uh a variety of uh Revenue
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
sources that we can rely on uh the
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
amount of reserves we have how much
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
money we have rain fund um budgetary
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
pressures you know how much we approve
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
during budgets or operan budgets you
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
know the cost of Medicaid
 
00:32:36.799 --> 00:32:37.789 align:start position:0%
know the cost of Medicaid
post-employment

00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
post-employment
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
benefits retirement plans and of course
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
debt our debt burden and so that's what
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
we review at the treasury we're
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure that the
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
state stays um maintains those uh prent
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
um debt management policy so to continue
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
with that so as you all know um the
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
state was upgraded ated um last year
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
because we've had um a very good uh
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
financial situation over the last few
 
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
years we're Revenue performing well um
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
maintaining our debt burden um
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
manageable so all of those pieces came
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
together and uh one of the rting
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
agencies um upgraded us so that was
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
great news so now the reality is um you
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
know we are we're facing a um a budget
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
year that is changing the the the
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
elements that helped us so we're still
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I always say our
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
debt we can we we can't really control
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
our revenues but we can manage our debt
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
so we look at our debt affability in two
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
in two ways we um we prepare a debt
 
00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
affordability study and that study um
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
calculat that ratios that allow us to
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
see how we're doing um currently and how
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
we're going and how we're projected to
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
um uh over the next few years how those
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
ratios look like so uh on page three is
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
just a definitions you know I try to
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
describe what we do we have a DAT
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
affability side that we prepare every
 
00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
year and also um the statute RSS 6C um
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
requires to calculate um how much more
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature can approve without
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
going to a limit so without passing the
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
limit and the limit is 10% of un
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive revenue of the previous
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so the law says the
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
legislature cannot approve a um
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
more um more debt than um if if it's
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
more than 10% of the existing debt plus
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
projected debt meaning already
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
everything that has been already
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
authorized so on page um on page
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
four I'm just um the the typical ratios
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
that we look at is the um debt to
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
revenue ratio that's the key key one the
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
rating agencies um review and as you can
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
see this is the um the r how the ratio
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
has performed over the years and we
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
obviously that has improved
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
significantly over the last 10 years so
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
2015 it was
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
8.2% in 2024 that ratio is 3.8% so we
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
look at that number um when we calculate
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
um those debt ratios we obviously we
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
want to be um really low because not
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
only we want to compare to um the median
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
and and and how other states the same
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
um again 3.8% is is is really uh an
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
excellent um number um and um we never
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
want to get too close to 10% 10% will
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
probably uh will equal a
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
downgrade so on page um on page five is
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
just a picture how our debt has changed
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
over time is um you know this this graph
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
shows how how much debt we had in
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
2006 it increased over the during the
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
financial crisis um the State issue
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
additional Bond I think there was a
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
restructuring of debt and and different
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
um there were different measures that
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
were taken during that time but again
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
since then uh we have improved
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
significantly in um in our our general
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
fund debt uh and and other debt that we
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
issue for um fishing game and others all
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
of all of them are are decreasing so
 
00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:30.950 align:start position:0%
that's a really good picture
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.190 align:start position:0%
that's a really good picture
[Music]

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
here Bas six is just again it's a lot of
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
numbers here and but I just want to
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
focus on these are the ratios we
 
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:42.280 align:start position:0%
calculate and um I believe I shared
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
already the data affability study with
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
you and otherwise other other than that
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to share with all of you
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
as posted on our website but we
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
calculate again the different ratios and
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
and and different dep metrics uh and we
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
compare those to how for example these
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
are um in this graph we're showing the U
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
medians according to
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
Moody and um the last one the the the
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
one that says Debt Service to general
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
fund revenues that that median is
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
actually um published by S&amp;P Global and
 
00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
that median is um for um for stasa rated
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
similar to us so double A Plus rated
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
States so and 2024 it shows the actual
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
ratios those ratios again are are really
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
um healthy ratios uh debt per capita
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
debt to revenue ratio uh compared to the
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
medians are really really excellent
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
numbers so um all of this are these
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
calculations are based on some
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
assumptions that we have to make um so
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
for example we we estimate or we assume
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to stay within
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
that 120 million per bium so we
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
calculate that every year is going to be
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to issue 60 million and in
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
this particular case we assume no
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue growth um uh so uh revenues
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
staying flat over the next few years
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
this this this study that we prepare we
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
we calculate different scenarios is is
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
is a way of um a stress test um that we
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
do for um to see how our debt is going
 
00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:25.640 align:start position:0%
to perform compared to the median and
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
compared to how the state um the rating
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
agencies will uh will see the
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
state we're getting ready to uh issue
 
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
bonds again um in about two weeks we'll
 
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
have meetings with rating agencies that
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to review us again
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
so showing a picture like this with this
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
ratios is really U um a positive a
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
credit positive for
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
us in and so
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
2025 uh through 28 in this in this um um
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
table again is based on issuing 60
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
million each year and in 2025 we assume
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
that we're going to issue the 40 million
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
that you folks were talking about U
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
related to the prison so that's and so
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
in 2025 we were assuming we're going to
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
issue a 100 million of bonds um I know
 
00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier about the
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
status of the person we don't typically
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
interact with the state agencies as to
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
how they doing with their expenditures
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
because we're assume it's typically
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
about the same amount that is that they
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
spend and and when they they they incur
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
those expenditures um that's when we
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
issue our bonds but um we learned that
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
the prison wasn't ready to to spend the
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
40 million so we we are not going to
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
bond um the 40 million in this year the
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
way we we had anticipated so at this
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
point we're just assuming we're going to
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
issue those Bonds in
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
2026 um again so we make assumptions and
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
we calculate ratios and and and and
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
again based on those assumptions
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
um you know we prepare our our
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations so um we we typically
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
stay or or or what I will say to you is
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the the base cases 120 million for the
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
banum funded with General funds and the
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
reason for that as you can see we were
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
working towards uh reducing our ratio to
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
a point that is comparable to the median
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
so at this point in 2024 we are there um
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
when we're going to start issuing
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
additional Bond again staying within the
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
60 million per fiscal year and then we
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
add the 40 million that we was already
 
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
approved then our ratio start increasing
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
already so this is a fact there's really
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
nothing um um new so we already have you
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
know that that bonding has been
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
authorized so we're going to assume
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
that's going to be spent and so those
 
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
ratios going to start to
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
increase we don't know how revenues are
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
going to perform but but this is when
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
things um you know the ability to when
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
we say we want to stay within the 120
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
130 million is because of this reason
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
and that's the way we see it and of
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
course it doesn't answer the questions
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
that you all may have and the agencies
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
right it doesn't it doesn't um it
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh provide what agencies want to
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
hear but this is what we the way we see
 
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
it is just we want to maintain a um um a
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
debt um the debt levels are manageable
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
in a way that say can continue to afford
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
that and of course any additional debt
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
that this committee and and the
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
legislature approves um is additional
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
Debt Service that um needs to be paid uh
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
with operating funds um so that's the
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
the debt affordability picture that um
 
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know in in general we look
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
seven that's representative BR thank you
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh in the previous
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
page you talked about the the $40
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
million for the prison being deferred to
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
2026 does this chart show that uh that
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
that change this RSA 6 C
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
chart is that reflected in this chart
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
follow me chart well the the so I'll
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
talk about this chart so this chart is
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
is according to the law we need to
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
calculate uh the debt limit um but we
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
have to include everything that has been
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
any any outstanding debt so Debt Service
 
00:42:26.599 --> 00:42:27.710 align:start position:0%
any any outstanding debt so Debt Service
already

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
um that we were paying existing Debt
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
Service and also anything that has we
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
have to project that service for
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
everything that has been authorized and
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
unissued so to answer your question it
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
includes everything not only the 40
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
million it includes so so the way this
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
chart is and this is just an attempt to
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
try to um respond to the law right so
 
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
there may be other ways to calculate
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
this um this limit but um the the second
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
column um um
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
from left to right it shows uh
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
everything that has been authorized and
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
issu so right now is
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
3744 million that has been authorized
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
and issued um the First Column shows
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
actual uh uh Debt
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
Service and then we also have to
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
include all the all the debt that the
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
state has guaranteed so this is that
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
that the state is um um you know if
 
00:43:31.549 --> 00:43:31.559 align:start position:0%
there is a need to to to to to um step
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
in and pay for that debt is everything
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
so anything that has been authorized uh
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
for the uh business Finance Authority uh
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
peace Development Authority they have um
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
some um authorizations and the state um
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
guarantees their debt so all all of that
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be included in this calculation
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
so um so it's everything um that the
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
state has promised and so the the law
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
says no more than 10% can be can be can
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
be authorized um if if the existent if
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
the existent and projected debt is going
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
to be more so when we finished all these
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
calculations it correlates to another
 
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in bond and
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
authorization I never gonna um suggest
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you do that but I guess bottom line
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
is this this law um provides for a um a
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
limit un you which is different than
 
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640 align:start position:0%
this the federal government
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
um the state state law provides a limit
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
and but it's a generous limit I guess I
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
will say U because we never want to get
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
to that 10% we always want to maintain
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
it again as I showed you before in a in
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
a manageable way we want to stay within
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
those medians and and so we can maintain
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
that uh credit rate and that allows us
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
to keep um the the borrowing law Bor and
 
00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.190 align:start position:0%
to keep um the the borrowing law Bor and
cost

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
low and so so this is a calculation we
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
have to provide it we we we provide this
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
to um the legislative budget assistant
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
every year and and again this is uh
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
required by law thank
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
you so on page eight is just um you know
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
just a summary of um again a few points
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
that um you know key take key
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
takeaways um so clearly the state has
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
capacity to borrow more there's no doubt
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
and even if revenues um
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
if if revenues continue to um you know
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
not perform according to how we want
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
them to perform the state will still has
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to to to borrow more um but
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
again um any additional Bond and
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
authorization that we have to that we
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
have to um again go out and issue bonds
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
that will increase obviously The Debt
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
Service and and and the state's ability
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
to um to pay that debt
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
um right as I mentioned earlier the that
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
we can manage our debt obligations but
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
revenues is you know is is what's a
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
little more um um difficult to to
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate and and the one point I just
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to mention in
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
and just is a is a reminder of sometimes
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
I see projects and and I don't fully
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
know the the useful lives of some of
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
those projects but a reminder that we
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
issue bonds for 20 years we amortise
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
that debt for over 20 years so anything
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
that they're useful life of those
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
projects is is less than that number I
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
guess I would just um um recommend that
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
you you you review that and and and you
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
make a decision accordingly but at least
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
you know keep that in mind that we're
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
borrowing uh for a period of 20 years
 
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
and if there are if there is no need to
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
include certain equipment that doesn't
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
live that long doesn't last that long is
 
00:46:53.069 --> 00:46:53.079 align:start position:0%
is is for you to consider so that's what
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
I had uh for prepare remarks I'll be
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any additional questions
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
well I will ask the first question which
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
is uh once again I heard you say the the
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
magic 120 million I know you're very
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that I know last year
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
you were very comfortable because we
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
threw out 130 million how comfortable
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
are you with 143 million right
 
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
now I was actually not um fully aware
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
that that was going to be the number I
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
was here in the 130 million so um I
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
think I think it's a decision 4 million
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
seems again if we could as as you
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned I'm not sure what the what the
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
Senate will do or um so if we start
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
changing our our math um I just I just
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
showed you the math if we start changing
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
the math then that's how we're um you
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
know we'll get um again we perhaps need
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
to find a a a more um um number that we
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
want to work with and and the re and I
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
always hear
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
um the the cost of projects have incre
 
00:47:58.829 --> 00:47:58.839 align:start position:0%
increased uh inflation and all of that
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
and I fully recognize that but my job is
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
to calculate those numbers to stay
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
within those numbers right so um I would
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
say 140 seems a bit high in my opinion
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
but but it's it's not again the state
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
can afford that um is is really um if
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
the state wants to stay within 100 140 I
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
will say 130 is a little better um once
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
again we we never want to hold you to
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
any of this this is this is not for this
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
is just for our yes internal use working
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
here uh would would 135 be an equitable
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
number that sounds reasonable to me I
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
guess you find I'll find a compromise
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
number right this this this gives us a
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
place that we can start as a committee
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
and saying we're comfortable with it
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
because quite
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
frankly even looking at the intelligence
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
of this committee I don't think anybody
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
understood what you said on those first
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
eight pages that's why we always maybe
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'm oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah baloney
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
don't please don't give me that anyway
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the chair always' task was
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
asking this this dollar figure thank you
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you yeah no I I tried
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
to explain it in a way that I feel like
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
U you'll be able to understand it but
 
00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
essentially is really we we crunch the
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
numbers to try to show you um that
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
currently we're doing really well the
 
00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:22.839 align:start position:0%
city is doing really well uh the debt
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
management practices of the state of the
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
last few years has paid off and so stay
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
with within those boundaries is will be
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
will be prudent uh but again I know you
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
have the difficult task to approve uh
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
Cal projects but I think um you again
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
staying within those numbers um uh
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
finding a good balance there I think
 
00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that should be that should be
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank you representative
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions I actually
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
have two questions if that's
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
okay the first one's on P
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
six going back to the net Debt Service
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
to general fund revenues is those
 
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
to general fund revenues is those
percentages

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
cumulative when it's like for 25 it says
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
4.4% is that a cumulative of all of our
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
debt and so that when we're at that 10%
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
Mark that you were talking about we're
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
only using total 4.4 4%
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
approximately to that
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
10% that's correct that's that's that's
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
total it's cumulative so it's it's is
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
it's total debt um this this number does
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
not include uh on page six this number
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
does not include
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
um um debt guaranteed by the state but
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
we do in the study we prepare another
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
chart that shows that and so when we
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
include um assuming which is would be
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
very unlikely but assuming the state
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
were to um pay all that debt has been
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
guaranteed um the the number increases
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
by uh 100 basis points so another per uh
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
another 1% so even with that even if the
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
state were to PID everything
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
um the number still um manageable okay
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
follow followup please thank you and you
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh the uh 60 million per year so that's
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
100 20 and then you said we were going
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
to fast forward over to 2640 million so
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the 26 we have to look at 160
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
million is that what I understood that
 
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.829 align:start position:0%
million is that what I understood that
would

00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
be possibly bonded yes so in 26 it will
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
be 100 million because it will be the 40
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
million plus a 60 but again if if this
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
Committee of you know the the the final
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
product of the capital budget is is more
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
than that then we'll just add another
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
five or 10 million um the amount that
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to Pro follow please so
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um so if we're looking for
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
that 100 million already for
 
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
26 does that uh the question previously
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
asked was about that 135 million for the
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
b b Minal or for the two years uh
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that number is already going to be
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
skewed no this is cumulative she you're
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about she's giving you
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
cumulative numbers that are coming up
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
not 100 well I was talking about the 160
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
or the 100 million for 26 is already
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
that would be the 60 that we would have
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget room for plus the 40 for
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
the prison that's 100 million
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
already yes but it's it's all included
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
in here so we so again the the the
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
anomaly here was the 40 million um but
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
but the math again is is is is 60 to 70
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
million um for each each year of the
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
bium that's what you get and the only
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
anomaly will be adding 40 million
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
whenever we issue that so we're not
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
going to issue in 25 but we're going to
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
issue in 26 um so it will reflect it
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
will just the the ratio will start
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
increasing then rather than so for
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
example 25 may stay around the
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
4% um but then going forward it will
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
increase um again just because of the uh
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
we will bond that additional 40 million
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense thank you
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you isn't
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
the 40 million was was authorized but
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
unissued in a prior term so it's already
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
counted in there correct yeah that's
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
what we're that's what we're including
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
in the math representative
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
fauler thank you I think we're trying to
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
get this ma turn not right but we issue
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
new Debt Service $60 million a year but
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
we are also paying off some of the debt
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's out there so that the net
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
increase is not 60 million it's
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
something less than that is that correct
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
and and the and the 60 million is just
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
the assumption but you're correct so so
 
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
this calculation includes those new
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
issues where we're paying off and and
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
and what happens to us we don't we don't
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
always issue the exact 60 million right
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
we issue we issue bonds based on how
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
soon the agent spend that money so if
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
they haven't spent the money like in the
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
case of the prison we're not going to
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
issue bonds we're going to wait until
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
they're ready to to to um to spend those
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
funds so there are times that we issue
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
less than 60 but again it's it's just
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
less or more so again it's all it's just
 
00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
a you know on average that's what we
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
typically talk about and this is all
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
paid with General funds represent bone
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
question uh uh so we currently owe 525
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
million in
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
bonds that is correct and that's um on
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
page six that is that is correct and
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
that is um that is um um
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
just um what we call net tax supported
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
debt so pay with General
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
funds follow how much is left on the
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
school building Aid because I used to be
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
on education I've been following it for
 
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:26.829 align:start position:0%
on education I've been following it for
years

00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
year so it's actually um let me get that
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
anyway so just to to answer your
 
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
previous question so um we actually all
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh we allow less for uh general fund is
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
about 400 million right now but School
 
00:55:57.029 --> 00:55:57.039 align:start position:0%
Bill and a is um uh we have about $30
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
million left
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
outstanding and that we're going to pay
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
that off in
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
2029 okay coming tou down on the amount
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
of building
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
heat thank you you're welcome any
 
00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:15.150 align:start position:0%
heat thank you you're welcome any
further

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you madam
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
treasur it's been very very very in
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
enlightening and I think we've got our
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
our little old magic number to work with
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
here pleasure Mr chairman thank you very
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
you um this committee I Think We're not
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled now to meet till March 4th a
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and we will uh will'll be
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
hitting the ground running at 10:00 a.m.
 
00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
I think we're scheduled through till 3
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon uh we've done things a
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
little bit differently this year we used
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
to schedule them in half hour 45 minutes
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
an hour depends and uh on M Mr Shay's
 
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion we've lumped them all
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
together so that we won't have any we'll
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
take our own little breaks in between as
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
necessary but we won't have any of the
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
Dead periods in between you know if we
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
allocated somebody for an hour and they
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
took 20 minutes we would have to sit
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
here for 40 minutes twiddling our thumbs
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
so instead we're going to be able to
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
just take them in a row and get them
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
done as quickly as we can and utilize
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
our time
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
efficiently Mr Shay anything to wrap up
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh so at the near the end of the week
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
I'll shoot an email to everybody um that
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
will have the um loose schedule for the
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
agencies for next Tuesday so as the
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
chair has indicated in the calendar it
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
will show at 10:00 you're starting um
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
it'll show the agencies in the order
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
that they're going to present so it'll
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
be Department of administrative Services
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
doit governor's office in the morning
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
what I'll send you is I've asked the
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
agencies you have an hour ad
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
administrative Services 60 Minutes um
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
doit you have a half hour governor's
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
office you have a half hour so I'll give
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
you that schedule just so you kind of
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
see how long an agency should be taking
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
but the whole point was if you have an
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
agency who's scheduled for an hour and
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
they take 30 minutes you can go right
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
moving representative fauler are are
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
they able to uh stand by in their oppos
 
00:58:27.789 --> 00:58:27.799 align:start position:0%
I don't hate to have all these people
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
waiting here that was the reason for the
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
what I would say behind the scen
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
schedule or I said you know plan on
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
speaking for 60 minutes plan on speaking
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
for 30 minutes um The Hope is that the
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that are next in line will pay
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
attention and know to be here if they if
 
00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:45.039 align:start position:0%
they think that agency is not going to
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
take the full amount of time if I'm made
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
aware beforehand I will also let the
 
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
agencies know so if uh just say
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
came in and said we're going to be done
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
in like 10 minutes well would let theit
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
know to please come in or schedule
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
another agency in addition
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
to um but yeah at this point you got two
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
days of hearings scheduled it should
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
cover all the
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
agencies um unless there's a you know an
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
agency or two that you need to bring
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
back and then we would have to schedule
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
another day to do that and then there'll
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
be the usual lapse extension meeting um
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
that will be potentially March 14th is
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
the tentative date we've been telling
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
the agencies we're doing it a little bit
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
differently this time and that we've
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
asked I've asked the agencies to report
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
on their laps extensions as part of the
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
presentation to the full committee uh I
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
noted in the last couple cycles that
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes members who aren't part of
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
that committee their subcommittee felt
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
like they didn't know why some of the
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
decisions were made as it related to the
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
lapse extension so this gives everybody
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
the same information and then at a later
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
point they the chair will have a
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work on finalizing the laps
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
extensions and Laps extensions for new
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
members are basically cap capital
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
projects um that the agencies would like
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
to have continue without this lapse
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
extension they would they would truly
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
lapse at the end of the bium the
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
authority to spend the money would go
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
away so agencies that you know for
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
example with the um $40 million for the
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
prison they'll need an an extension to
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that money doesn't lapse
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
um and and it's it's the back pages of
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
that pink document that I gave you
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
there's probably 150
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
um items that agencies have asked to to
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
not lapse for various reasons and and
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
this committee goes through that pretty
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
intently um to make sure that there
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
items that are there should be there
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
items that didn't make the list that
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
should be are added and then um if
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's a any available funds remaining
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
um this committee has in the past tried
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
to repurpose those funds to projects
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
that you would like to have money go to
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
um but it's all dependent on how much uh
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
um is available through the laps
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
extension process and that's never known
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
truly until we get done that
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
process but that that's all I
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
got anybody any further questions
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
comments representative cludia yes thank
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
