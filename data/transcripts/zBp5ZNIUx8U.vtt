terms of the budget uh this is a
 
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget uh the only increases
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
are um prioriti prioritized needs from
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
doit otherwise we're sticking within the
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
the uh parameters that we had last time
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
you know maintenance
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
budget and uh yeah we'll go from there
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
questions you went you not only did your
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
election go well your presentation was
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
the briefest one
 
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
yet I've had a lot of
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
practice we have no questions thank you
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
you okay um following that is the right
 
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
is my mic on it is not on if you just
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
pressed the button in front of you to
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
the red light that's I'm on now I feel
 
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
bad because the Secretary of State's
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
presentation is going to be shorter than
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
mine but mine will still be five minutes
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
you stop me if I if I'm not um uh since
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a fairly new agency and although
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
some of you may know me already I'd like
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you a little bit about who we
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
are I'm Thomas FC the new Hampshire
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
right to know Ombudsman also known as
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
the RKO uh as I'm fond of saying I
 
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
brought my entire agency with me to
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
address you here today uh the RKO was
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
first staffed in uh on July 27 2023 in
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
the middle of a budget cycle and it
 
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
consists of one person that's me uh I've
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
been New Hampshire attorney since 1986
 
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
more than half that time in state
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
service the law that establishes my
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
office which is a 2022 Law chapter 250
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
gives it somewhat competing goals of
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
providing the public with a simpler less
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
expensive and faster alternative to the
 
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in resolving complaints
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
under RSA 91a RSA 91a is the access to
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
governmental records and governmental
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
meetings and Records law commonly known
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
as a right to no law so I basically
 
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
decide contested cases and I seek to
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
resolve them informally when I can uh
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
pursuit of a claim under RSA in superior
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
court cost several hundred filing a
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
complaint with my office cost $25
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
payable to the general fund since the
 
00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
first day of the office's operation I've
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
received 254 inquiries of various natur
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
71 of those became formally filed
 
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 align:start position:0%
complaints they come at an unpredictable
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
rate and uh more than half are currently
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
resolved about 40 of those 254 with the
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
substantial equivalence of right to no
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
request in my office itself I hear cases
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
against uh various units of state
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
government including but not limited to
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
State executive branch agencies a State
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
Legislative Branch counties cities towns
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
school districts and in terms of review
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
of my activities pursuing to RC 91 a7b
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh 7 yeah 7B 7c uh Appeal on my rulings
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire Superior Court and then
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
potentially up to the Supreme Court so
 
00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
I'm somewhat between three branches of
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
government although I'm an independent
 
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency I'm attached for
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
administrative purposes Department of
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
State and uh when I started this
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
experimental journey I had a cubicle a
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
computer space provided by the secretary
 
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
of state budget consisting primarily of
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
my salary and benefits plus a few
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
thousand in current expenses which ended
 
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
up being postage uh I have a statute to
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
follow and my commission which like my
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%

State House Annex which as you may know
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
is currently under construction what
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here today is a budget
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
for what might be after my office ceases
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
to exist uh my information begins to pay
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
72 the Secretary of State's budget book
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
it consists of my anticipated salary and
 
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
benefits current expenses which is
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
mostly paper Postage and such like
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
supplies is a small amount that's in for
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
supplies uh for example a lock box for
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
filings and payments uh I don't
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
currently have that people the US mail
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
brings me things puts it on my chair uh
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
or people come in drop it off by hand uh
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps some improved or additional
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
recording equipment and there's a bit in
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
this item for uh travel $500 all the
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
hearings I currently have are in
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
conquered but I'd like to have the
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of holding those hearings on
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
the road if if it's more convenient to
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
the parties and I'd like to do that
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
without my own personal expense uh
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
there's also about $7,000 for consultant
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
services with that uh if I continue to
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
exist I'd hope to retain an individual
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
perhaps an intern uh a legal intern to
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
produce what might be called the users
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
guide in order to better explain my
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
office make the operations more
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
conceptually accessible and
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
understandable perhaps give me some
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
assistance with uh my administrative
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
tasks like scheduling and answering
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
public information
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
requests uh frankly we could use we uh
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
could use uh one part-time attorney
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
Clerk and one part-time administrative
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
assistant or paralal but I've not asked
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
for that here there's been $1 placed in
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
the budget that you're looking at uh for
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
part-time Personnel in case uh that
 
00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:25.519 align:start position:0%
should become budgetarily possible at
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
some point in the future and in the
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
meantime I continue to serve as the
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%

other things until such time as the RKO
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
expires uh fortunately for the state
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
budget I am an unclassified employee so
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's no overtime that's a factor in
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
my budget that's all I got that's who I
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
am any questions I can
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
answer uh you have a few
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
questions could you uh approximate how
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
many either complaints or inquiry you
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
get and then over the last year and then
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
how many have been resolved about uh
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
let's the way I break it down is
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
inquiries that's people contacting my
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
office of the uh of the
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
254 inquiries I've had 71 that became
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
formally filed complaints coming at an
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
unpredictable rate don't know when
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're coming uh and uh more than half
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
of those are currently resolved okay
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you and to extend your your office
 
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and to extend your your office
Beyond

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
July June 30th
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
2025 uh are you going to make an hb2
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
request to I I have asked uh a
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislator if you'd be so kind as to uh
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
put in LSR to extend yes I don't I
 
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the bill at this point okay
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
I I know it's an LSR but I haven't seen
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
a b okay thank you very much could you
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
just forward the legislator's name to me
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
on my email
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
so the what you said you spoke to A
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislature about putting in an
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
could you just forward his name to me
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
his or her name to me on I I I don't
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
think there's anything you're just
 
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
anything private about that I I as the
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
chair of the Judiciary to do it how
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I just want to check on it
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.590 align:start position:0%
okay I
think

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I think it mentions in your um in
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
your budget submission that it's Bob
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
Linn and it's LSR
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
20257 that would be correct okay
 
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
um he's the the current legislation
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
would would extend as we think the LSR
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
is drafted extend you for a year um but
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
you might get extended for two that
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean I get extended my agency
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
might get extended I does your do your
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
term expires as well July 1st
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
2025 um seems unlikely that if they were
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
to extend it that they wouldn't extend
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
you that would be kind of a pain um so
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
couple of questions um you said that you
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
would want if the budget uh supported
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
it um perhaps a part-time clerk Etc kind
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
of a person I I wonder if if that's the
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
case if you would mind right it's the
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
kind of thing we would want to give to
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
the um the incoming Governor's budget
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
team so if you could write up something
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
sort of more formally uh in the form of
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
a request certainly um that way that way
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
we're able to catalog any request that
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
happens to come in I'm not saying
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be money for it but
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
just so that's there
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
um and um the basement of the annex we
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
often refer to as the ground
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
level it's referred to as many things Mr
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
Arling housee I uh I'm aware but a lot
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
of them we can't mention in a public
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
session I would just point that out as
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you it's was good to see you
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
you next up on the list is the
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and good afternoon Mr

Chuck seya executive director Governor's
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability and to my left
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
is the gcds business administrator um
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
Miss AC dubia um thank you for the
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to present um on our
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
budget uh by way of backround background
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
excuse me the governance Commission on
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
disability is statutorily created uh
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
275c um within the organizational
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
structure of the state the gcd is Right
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
within um the governor's office it is
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
the commission itself uh right now is
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
made up of 16 Governor appointed
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
commission members uh and there also um
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
ex official members non-voting members
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh which is a cross-section um of state
 
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
government um Commissioner of HHS uh
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Labor um Commissioner of
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
Employment Security um doe uh Department
 
00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
of Education is also at the table with
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
vul rehab and services for blind and
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
vision imp as well as the um State uh
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
Board of Education when we look at the
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
mission of the gcd and the enabling
 
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
statute um it really comes down to the
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure you're all well aware um
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
the Ada ensures non-discrimination um
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
based upon a disability although we are
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
not an enforcement agency um I would
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
state to this honorable committee we we
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
serve a a pivotal a pivotal um portion
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the state entity when individuals
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
with disabilities um are are afforded
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
representation because part of our
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
mission is to advise the governor the
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
legislature and the public as relates to
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
programs and services uh for those with
 
00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:02.590 align:start position:0%
programs and services uh for those with
a

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
disability um the office is made up of
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
six full-time um positions and two
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
part-time positions one of the part-time
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
positions is currently vacant um however
 
00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
it is fully funded and we have been
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
actively um attempting to secure a
 
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
candidate in that position um what I
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
refer to as the accounting units um
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
there are three major accounting units
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
at the gcd which would be
 
00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
at the gcd which would be
one4

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
one4
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
one6 and
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
17 uh one6 is 100% federally funded um
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
with uh one full-time employee
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
10007 is predominantly passed through uh
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
funds that we receive from the Public
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission relay Service uh
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
trust fund which finances um a program
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
at the gcd known as the
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications equipment assistance
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
program as well as news news line for
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
the blind um regarding the funding that
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
comes from the Pu and goes to the tep
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
teap there is a
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
$3,750 Administration administrative fee
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
which stays at the gcd for the operation
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
of that program and ensuring that the
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
vendor that is selected um carries out
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
the um requirements some of the program
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
so the the major Au um for the gcd is 1
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
004 and to this honorable committee I'm
 
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
happy to report that we um did stay
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
within the targets um that were placed
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
there obviously we went to every class
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
and and I know you hear this it's we do
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
look at the salaries and the benefits
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
which are typically given which are
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
given to us and then we just go through
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
a cross-section of the other classes to
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
see based upon the FY 24 um actual
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
expenses based upon the appropriation in
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
25 and then the target we we actually
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know cut where we could to ensure
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
that we within the target um the biggest
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
um cut or the biggest um attempt to
 
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
arrive at the Target would be in the um
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
part-time position so the part-time
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
position is currently funded at 29 hours
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
per week um in order to meet the target
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
we did reduce that to a 23-hour um
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
position and then we took the overage
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong Stacy
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
because sometimes you read the numbers
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
and you read gets blurry the rest of the
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the prioritized needs request
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
um that has been requested in this
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
budget covers the difference between the
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
the 23 and 29 hours so within that um
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
compliment we were able to um um stay
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
within it I would suggest to this
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
honorable committee um the 29-hour
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
position will serve um the state well um
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
the position is known as an 88
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
coordinator um this was a it is a
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
request that has a little bit of History
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh going back a few years ago the gcd uh
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
put together what was known as a
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
Workforce focus group to to look at um
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
um the state of New Hampshire as an
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
employer and to say we want to ensure
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
that we're a model employer as it deals
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
with individuals with disabilities um
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
and in as a Regard in reference to that
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
um I worked in my team worked very
 
00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
closely with the division of personnel
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and um one of the recommendations that
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
came out of the workforce focus group is
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
that in 88 coordinator to sit as a
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
resource to the rest of state government
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
when another agency perhaps as a an
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
individual with a disability they're on
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
boarding or an individual who is
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
currently in state government there may
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
be questions as a revolves around um
 
00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
accommodations or or other questions
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the employment and to have
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
that person seated at the governance
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability and we intend
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we would work very closely with
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel we would be able um to address
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
those issues so that's a a very high
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
level um I'm more than happy to go
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
further um into the positions if you'd
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
like to know a little bit more about
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
that I will tell you um and this is a I
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
guess an incredible plug for um uh
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
division of personnel um as you all know
 
00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
there is a unit over at division of
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
personnel known as hru human resource
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
support unit um we have found that to be
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
an incredibly valuable tool for us um we
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
went under contract with Hsu
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
um I think in the last budget cycle um
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
we also have a um we've also built
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
hru um into this budget although there's
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
not a separate class but again within
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
the targets um I will tell you the HRS
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
Hsu uh is an incredible tool I would say
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
especially for smaller agencies and
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
medium agencies because to deal with the
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day requests um that that that
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
come up that I may not be able to assist
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
as quickly or or Stacy may not uh to
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
have Hsu at the ready is a is a
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh compliment um to the state
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
I'll also point out that when we put the
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
budget together um in Stacy what class
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
is our rent that we pay class 49 so
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
class 49 so we're we're up on um
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
Regional drive so we're sub tenants of
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
our division of personnel so our rent is
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
actually paid to personnel and Personnel
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
is under a third party lease that they
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
pay to a private landlord uh Great Space
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
great neighbors but when we built this
 
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.390 align:start position:0%
great neighbors but when we built this
budget

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
we obviously took that um into um
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
consideration because I I don't I think
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh Personnel may be going through that
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
process now um so we had to figure out
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
well if there was going to be an
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
increase what would that be so we
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
included that um within that and again
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
this is um all um within the um Target
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
that that was there um one of the you
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
know we have a few programs at the gcd
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
um and I will tell you a program uh they
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
came about in 2017 is is known as New
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's able able Savings Plan able
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
savings plan allow individuals with
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities um to save money tax-free
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
um without jeopardizing need needs-based
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
benefits which is supplemental security
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
income um as well as Medicaid um Federal
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed in 2014 uh New
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire brought it um in 2016 and uh
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the co-administrators of the program per
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
the statute uh the New Hampshire State
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
Treasurer Monica mesap LA and myself the
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
gcd executive director um the able
 
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
Savings Program I am going to tell you
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
straight out is a game changer for
 
00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
individuals with a disability to be able
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
to save money without those benefits I'm
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
being encroached upon um we've operated
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
with again with with no extra staff uh
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
from 2017 and without any even General
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
funds um so it's it has been there are
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
many many people that are benefiting um
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
from that program so that is essentially
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
at the gcd and uh the state Treasury and
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
it has changed people's lives it's a it
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
definitely is a um an incredible
 
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
resource for individuals um to be able
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
to live a fruitful life so that's the
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
gcd at a very high level I'm more than
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions or to go
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
into further details but I leave that up
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
to to all of you and thank you again for
 
00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:23.310 align:start position:0%
to to all of you and thank you again for
this

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity in um hi Chuck um hi Chie hi
 
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
both of you sorry
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
um in one4 you have $90,000 of transfer
 
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:36.440 align:start position:0%
income what what's that
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
from you want to address that which
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
which is it again Char in one4 your main
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
accounting the one Z4 yes go right ahead
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
yep go righte I think it's about 90
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
grand um that's from silk that's um
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
transfer money from Department of
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
Education um for the silk program you
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
want to talk sure great question Charlie
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
and Stacy excellent excellent um so
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
essentially um at the gcd we are under
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the New Hampshire
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to house a
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
part-time employee um known as the
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide Independent Living Council
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
program assistant um okay per the
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
contract with commission with um the
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
commission of Ed 990,000 is there for is
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
there for us however we draw Down based
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
upon our needs so obviously it would be
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
the part-time salary the benefits um
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
supervision fees for my self to ensure
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
that the individual is integrated into
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
the gcd as well as um uh necessary fees
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
that are associated with the business
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
administrator so the 90s there but what
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
do we typically pull down last year it
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
was like 70,000 so about 70,000 was last
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
year that we pulled down okay cool thank
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah thanks
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
Charlie your your funding is is pretty
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
much all General funds are transfer from
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
other agencies in one4 that is that is
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
correct Mr yes okay uh how much federal
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
funds do you yeah so in
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
10006 the federal
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
funding um for FY 26 uh excuse me
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
26 um
 
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.110 align:start position:0%
26 um
174

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
174
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
174,175 for FY 26 right I notice that
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
was had had dropped a little bit from uh
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
2025 to 2026 six you're anticipated yeah
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
what's is that correct um if Stacy May
 
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
address you yes yes of course um
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
basically it dropped because we never
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
spend all that money and technically
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
we we never know how much we actually
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
get um because sometimes other states
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
don't use all their money so that money
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
comes to us although and we like for
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
example we were given a certain amount
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
of money for fiscal year 20 Federal
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 that we haven't even used
 
00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:09.310 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 that we haven't even used
yet

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
and we probably won't use all our money
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year Federal fiscal year 23
 
00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:17.549 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year Federal fiscal year 23
which

00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
closes shortly basically once we have
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
all our oop sorry um once our rest of
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
the bills come in for any outstanding
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
um expenses because it goes it's on a
 
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:35.799 align:start position:0%
two-year basis so basically because we
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't really spend that amount of money
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
we just reduced it a bit and not just
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we we changed a little bit how we
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
the the um amounts for shared funds for
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
example um the rent it's always been a
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
certain amount paid by general fund and
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
a certain amount paid
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
by um federal funds and so we've changed
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
that in this federal budget because I I
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure where those numbers were
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
coming from so now we are um
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
basically um based on how much was spent
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
the previous year what you know the the
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
grand totals from the pre previous year
 
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.230 align:start position:0%
grand totals from the pre previous year
which

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
will change yearly but they don't they
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't change much so we basically
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
changed how we allocate the shared funds
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
so if an auditor comes in we can say
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
this is how we came about these
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
percentages for General and and federal
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
funds okay so because you didn't spend
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
it you didn't request it again right in
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
your budget that's incredibly
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
anything else asking any of the
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your

again thank you for the opportunity
thank

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%

you okay next up is theas Development
Authority

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon my name is
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
Susie anzelone I'm the finance director
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
for the peas Development Authority and I
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
have miles Greenway who's the acting
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
Port director at the division of ports
 
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.470 align:start position:0%
Port director at the division of ports
and

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
harbors so um our budgets mainly consist
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
of salaries and benefits uh we currently
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
have uh four full-time classified
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
employees in three-part time we're not
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
um anticipating any changes in our
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
staffing some of the budget increases
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
that you are seeing are really due to uh
 
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:28.149 align:start position:0%
that you are seeing are really due to uh
future

00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
of our expenses salaries benefits
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
workers comp all of those things so um
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
there is no no impact to the general
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
fund and that's pretty much it unless
 
00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:42.919 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes uh the the overtime
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
line seems to me at least to be quite
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
High uh I just wonder if you could just
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
go through and and and why that is yeah
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
those the numbers that we get and Steve
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
you can um um Steve mlin if you will
 
00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:03.799 align:start position:0%
remind me of the where those numbers
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
come from those come to us from the
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
payroll Administration and they always
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
do seem to run higher than what our
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
actual costs are um and so we don't
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
anticipate using all of the overtime
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
funds in there unless something
 
00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.029 align:start position:0%
funds in there unless something
extraordinary

00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
happens like some really bad storms
 
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:33.230 align:start position:0%
happens like some really bad storms
again

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
um as determined by RSA
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
498a and all matters relating to the
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
need for reassessments for
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities you can find a list of
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
all the statutory matters that are
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
appealable to the board on pages 11 and
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
12 of the budget manual and as you will
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
see we have a lot of
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
um statutes that are appealable to the
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
board so we never know from one day to
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
the next which is going to be
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
filed this board exists to protect the
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
rights of the taxpayers and the citizens
 
00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is how government runs
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
and I know we work for the governor and
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
I fully admit we work for the governor
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
but I also feel that we work for the
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
so we feel very strongly that we protect
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
those rights and we treat everyone as
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
treated we've complied with the
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
governor's 4% budget cut but at Great
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
expense in order order to do so we have
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
had to unfund a review appraiser
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
position because since 2008 the board
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
has had continuous staff Cuts we've gone
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
from a board of 12 to now a board of six
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
three board members three staff and we
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
have continually found innovative ways
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
to modify the workflow efficiencies with
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
less people but we're at that point now
 
00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
where we can't find any more efficiency
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
so our tent our intent in this budget
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
initially was to seek an additional
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
position excuse me because of the
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
increased workload but we heard early on
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
from the governor
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
that um funds were tight and you know we
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
were going to be making Cuts we weren't
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
be giving money so we didn't even make
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
do a 70 to to request a new position
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
so what we had to do in order to meet
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
the 4% budget was one of two things
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
either unfund a tax review appraise a
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
position or zero out all the all the
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
lines of the
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
budget that really isn't a choice we we
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
can't protect the citizens of the state
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
without any funds at all coming in so
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
reluctantly we unfunded the review
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
appraise of position and with that I'll
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
turn this over to miss stac and then we
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
will answer any questions you may
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
have thank you um I'll be brief um I've
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
been with the board since 2002 and and
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
as the chair stated we when I arrived we
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
had eight classified positions and I
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
have now a staff of two um we currently
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
have we just had 400 new appeals show up
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the doorstep for over you know and
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
and we do have 70 different areas of
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for three of us to handle
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh we all have a Le legal background but
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
we have been working very closely with
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
Personnel to get our positions get them
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
reclassified so we could get the legal
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
talent that we need to work on these
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
appeals before they go to the board
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
these appeals are complex they take a
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
lot of time and as Michelle stated we
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what's coming in the door any
 
00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.910 align:start position:0%
don't know what's coming in the door any
day

00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
um part of what personnel has really
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
recommended we've worked with a couple
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
positions um our plan before we were
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
told you know to come up with 4% which
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
again you know it was a choice of give
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
you back all the operating costs um so
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
we can't function or we have to give up
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
a position that what we really wanted to
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
do was have it reclassified Personnel
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
said hey you do need more staff we'd
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
like to take that position and
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
reclassify it and have it do some of
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
their appraisal appraiser duties and
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
then also help um with being working
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
with me um because in a small office
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
what happens if if one person is sick
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
one person's in a hearing and it leaves
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
one of us alone in a in a building and
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's happening way too much
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
the wheels are starting to come off and
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is you know when tax
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
come in I had a woman today I spent an
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
hour listening to her sob and trying to
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
figure out okay what is it that you need
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
how can we help you um and those are the
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that just you know you
 
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
think you have your day planned and in a
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
small office um we we just don't have
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
enough bodies and it it sounds really
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
crass to say that um we have made
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
efficiency since 2003 we've invested in
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
software we invested in um a software we
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
could we contracted for sales and
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
assessment data then we had to give that
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
money up so now we've gone back to
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
manually entering sales data from across
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
the state because we don't have any
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
other choice um that was back in 2007 um
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
we worked with the court the Supreme
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
Court um Justice bradrick in 2008 he
 
00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
said hey at the time when I showed up we
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
had 3,000 cases a year so we've worked
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
with them on a mediation program we've
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
gotten it down to um a reasonable number
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
but 400 is a l that's a lot of cases we
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
have 700 open rolling every year um and
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
these cases take a lot of time attention
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
um for three of us to handle and that's
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
assuming all three of us are you know
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else going on that takes
 
00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
us out of the office or whatever um so
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the wheels are starting to fall off
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we really would I I need to keep
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
this position it needs to be
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
reclassified um we're happy I
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
because as Michelle stated I we are very
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
sensitive and fiscally responsive we are
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with taxpayer dollars we
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
understand that more than anyone um
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
because we have to hear it day in and
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
day out and when you hear those stories
 
00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:43.400 align:start position:0%
um we're not in the business of taking
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
the precious money that we do have and
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
wasting it in any fashion we've done
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
everything we can do
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
um we used to have two review appraisers
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't find the need for that we gave
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
that was the one position we said okay
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need but every other time we
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
just keep getting chipped away one by
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
one we're getting picked off and that's
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
the reality if we lose this and we can't
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
reclassify it to get us more help um I'm
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
already neglecting duties and I hate to
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
say that uh because that shouldn't
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
happen the taxpayers deserve exactly
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
what um we have existed since 1911 to do
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
this work the work doesn't get easier
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
but there's pieces of my job I I just
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
can't get to because there's not enough
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
time and people and all of that and um
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
and you know not just you know sort of
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
cry about it but it's I'm just
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
frustrated and tired of it
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
so I really want to keep the position so
 
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.550 align:start position:0%
so I really want to keep the position so
thank

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
you I have a a couple of questions uh my
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
first actually is it's more of a
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
statement I'm going to go out on a limb
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
and and and sort of guess that as assess
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
values rise dramatically the number of
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
appeals to those assessed valuations
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
will go up dramatically as well so I
 
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
take it you've seen that over the last
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
few years since we've come out of covid
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
and assess values in the state have gone
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
up dramatically um could you do you have
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
any data as far as the number of appeals
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
and what they've looked like over the
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
last few years I yeah mentally I can
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
tell you absolutely we um during covid
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah things um um were a little bit
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
calmer we had less appeals even with
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
eminent domain the state had stopped
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
taking land so those went down we would
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
normally get anywhere we roughly on
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
average we would the state would we
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
would end up with about 25ish to 30
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
takings a year those Dro down to 10 now
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
we're seeing with the expansion of 4A
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're back with seeing a lot of cases um
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
and I assume once they come up towards
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
80 n and fixing conquered that those
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a lot of that so
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
those projects generate more work tax
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
appeals were up this year even compared
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
to last year by roughly about 50 cases
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that's been the trend for the last
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
few years
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
um what we're seeing now is increased
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
exemption appeals we have people we have
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
poverty appeals people can't pay the tax
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
um the exemption um people are you know
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
they're looking for ways for Relief um
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
we see quite a bit of of low and
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
moderate appeals people looking for um
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit of money back on
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the education portion and yes I I can
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
get you actual statistics if that's what
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
you'd like I'm happy to provide that but
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers the last couple years um
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
after covid are are starting to rise
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
again um and we're just we we also have
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
a rise in reassessments
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
um there are less and less L appraisers
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
Statewide they're
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
retiring this position was vacant in the
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
last biennium we've had a challenge to
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
because the salary is not um not enough
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
to get people in the door people in
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities are actually they're
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
making more than we can offer so we're
 
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
competing with that we're competing with
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the private sector anyway
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
but now we're competing with
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities which That Never Was a
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
problem before
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't we can't even find an
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
appraiser and I wish the state had a
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
pool of people that we could all kind of
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
share cuz I know dot has some but we get
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
appeals from dot so that doesn't work um
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
Dr certainly hasn't you know I wish
 
00:42:42.549 --> 00:42:42.559 align:start position:0%
there was a way to do that we've talked
 
00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
about that before but um strictly
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
speaking um we have to do something
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
different with the position where we can
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of the appraisal work
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
and also get us some sta some some help
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
for for um what what my position does
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
because I have no backup um so yep okay
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah that was going to be my next
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
question is is can you if if you get the
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
position back and can you actually find
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
someone and you mentioned reclassifying
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
that position I want if you could talk a
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
little bit about that as far as what you
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
want to do with
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah um we're going to look at
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
what duties without a professional
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
appraisal license um
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps those duties that could be done
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
by someone without a license or without
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
being certified by
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
that could still work um doing some
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
maybe going out to towns and collecting
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
some of the data because again we lost
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
the software to another budget cut so we
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
don't have um and that company real data
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
went out of business I believe anyway we
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
don't get any of that data so we have to
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
go collect it um so we could have some
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
of those duties be doing some of that
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
fine line of not performing appraisals
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
or anything like that but just
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
information collecting working with the
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
the towns and the assessors
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
and then on the other hand I need
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
someone that can be sort of the
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
financial backup part of my job is not
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
only office and Personnel Administration
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
but Financial in in um financial
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
management we we have to take all the
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
deposi of damages from do I'm sitting on
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
a bank account with over a million
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
dollars waiting for condomn E I've got
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
to distribute that money I've got to
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
account for that I need some help
 
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
financially with the duties yeah I we're
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
not attached to anyone so we have our
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
own database to manage which has to be
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
audited and there's there's all these
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of I'm wearing 12 hats which
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
other agencies have people to do those
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
jobs but in a small agency it's kind of
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's kind of centered on a few of us so
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
um part of the duties would be to be my
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
backup um because if if if something
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
happens to me there's no one there to do
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
the work that's the reality so it would
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
be kind of a mixed position and we we
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
had that on a different level years ago
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
I think in 2008 we had a program
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
assistant that did kind of that work but
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
we personnel and we've talked about this
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
it needs to be a higher level needs to
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
be somebody that can step into my shoes
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
if if I can't necessarily do that um and
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
and again our the two employees that we
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
have do radically different job duties
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
and they're they're I can't pull them
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
away from that either because again
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's only so much of us to handle the
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
work so hope that aners your question
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
yes it does and and I just want to let
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
you I know we talked about uh potential
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 and uh that's a great reminder for
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
for me to uh get it in front of uh
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
governor-elect aot and her team to uh to
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
put in the next budget if if if uh the
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
new governor decides to fund this
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
position it would actually be uh going
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
into hb1 and just be of your your
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget going forward that'd be
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
part of your efficiency budget so that's
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
how it would work thank
 
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
you could I just we get off that topic
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
if if the new governor does fund that
 
00:46:09.309 --> 00:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
position we'd like the name of the
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
position to be changed because it
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a review
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
appraiser that at least 60% of the work
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
if not more would be working with an on
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
on the duties that she has
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
so um whether it would require a
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
different um position number I would
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
assume it would but what we're looking
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
budget I I would just say that it would
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
it would be the continuation of the
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
existing position and the position would
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
be reclassed is how that would work so
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
the the budget item wouldn't actually um
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
fund a specific title per se unless you
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
eliminated the old position started a
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
new one and that would just take a long
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
time which nobody wants nobody wants it
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
to take a long time um I think what
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
might be helpful because it's not an
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized need currently in
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
your budget is if you would to write
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
something up just like a short one pager
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
probably less than one page um what
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
you're asking for how much it costs and
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
then a description of why and then I
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
think that's useful the the new
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
Governor's probably going to have in her
 
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:25.480 align:start position:0%
budget team we have a lot of requests
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
and it's useful to have that so that
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have to necessarily go back
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
and look at the transcript of this
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
meeting not that there'll be a
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
transcript um which makes it even
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
harder um so I would say that the other
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
thing is I wanted to ask um I know
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're sort of a vestage of the old Tax
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
Commission um back in the day um which
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
probably nobody remembers um in the room
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
except maybe Ken um and
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
um has there and so you have a board of
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
three people that hears that hears the
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
appeals has there there ever been any I
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
and I I suspect that's in statute has
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
there ever been any discussion about
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
doing more of a hearings office or
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
officer kind of a model or I guess we
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
now call them administrative law
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
judges there has been um and we've
 
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
talked about maybe a small claims but
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
the and it it was a board of four when
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
we when we merged the eminent domain
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
commission and the board of tax and land
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
appeals and in
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
2012 the legislature
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
put something in House Bill too where
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
they um took out one of the board member
 
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
positions so we are a three member
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
board because of the complexity of the
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
cases that we have now they're not your
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
mom and pop home you know assess for a
 
00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.109 align:start position:0%
mom and pop home you know assess for a
couple

00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
couple
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
hundred, we've got the commercial the
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
industrial the
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
contaminated there are so many that we
 
00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
need to work in function as a board so
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
that we're our rulings are
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
consistent and that would be difficult
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
if it was if we work just as a single
 
00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
board member hearing a case we did when
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
we had four members at one point because
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
we had so many cases and you know
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
Johnson Hall we were on the third floor
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
of Johnson Hall we created a second
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
hearing room and we had dual cases going
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
on two members in one room two members
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
in the other room and that worked quite
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
well for quite a long time but we had a
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
lot more staff which we don't have now
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly can I just and I'm
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
not trying to tell my own horn I just
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
Charlie knows how long I've been around
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
too long probably I'm not um we just
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
hire well the court we just had the law
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
changed so that the governor and Council
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
will now
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
um appoint a board member prior to that
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
it was the Supreme Court the last two
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
positions that needed to be filled was
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
one of our uh members who had her term
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
and she requested another term and the
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
way the new court was handling it was
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
to put something out on the web saying
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
we've got a position that's open and
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
we've got a board member already there
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
she wants a job but you know anybody
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
else that may be interested you can
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
apply the the court clerk was reporting
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
to me on all of this not one person
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
applied and then we had a member who
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
resigned or retired recently about a
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
year ago and they posted the position
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
and only one one person applied
 
00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.549 align:start position:0%
and only one one person applied
and

00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
luckily he started in January he's great
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
he's a young attorney he knows the law
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
he researches the law so we we Lo out
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
and we found someone but we need the
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
consistency of the board members to be
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
able to be fair to all the
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the other issue is a lot
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
of people aren't applying because the
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
salary is still at the level DD which is
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know everybody not as high as it
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
might be everybody that comes before us
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
earns more money than we do yet we need
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
to know more than they
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%

00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
defender
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
uses for today I tried to prepare a
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
comparison of the cost of the nhp
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
contract for Indigent defense when
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
compared to the other viable alternative
 
00:56:03.069 --> 00:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
which is a sign
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
Council as you can see from that
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
comparison using nhpd for these Services
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
is much more affordable and it's not
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
even close it's over $20 million more
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
affordable to use nhpd for these
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
services this is likely due to the
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
economies of scale that New Hampshire
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
public defender has as what is the
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
largest law firm in the state and it PD
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
has also developed internal efficiencies
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
such as in-house investigators dedicated
 
00:56:33.549 --> 00:56:33.559 align:start position:0%
staff who close cases for attorneys
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
paralegals that operat in house
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
investments in it and
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
training it is simply much more
 
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
expensive to do what nhpd does through a
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
sign Council than it is to have nhpd do
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
it on a contract
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
model and unfortunately the public
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
defender is under
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
strain as you can see in the charts in
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
the handout the nature of cases has
 
00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.510 align:start position:0%
the handout the nature of cases has
changed

00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
dramatically to give an
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
example a simple misdemeanor operating
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
after suspension charge essentially a
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
routine traffic crime used to involve
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps a single police report of a page
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes a paragraph even that same
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
case today could have hours of police
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
body camera Cruiser camera and
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
processing footage the data for that
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
particular case for an attorney to
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
review has grown exponentially and
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's why I've included the data from
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
public defender showing their storage
 
00:57:32.319 --> 00:57:33.309 align:start position:0%
public defender showing their storage
over

00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
time and that's just for a simple
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
routine misdemeanor and there are
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
thousands of those a complex case such
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
as a YDC criminal case which the JD
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
which which the judicial Council funds
 
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
several of can involve hundreds of
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages of Discovery so much
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
discovery that requires specialized
 
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
Services just to organize index and
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
review that discovery and that doesn't
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
include time for experts and other
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
expenses involved um in preparing those
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
cases I also want to point out the
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
recent proliferation of specialty courts
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
including mental health courts drug
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
courts veterans courts all of which have
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
have had major benefits for the state
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
but all these courts constitute an
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
additional resource Demand on the public
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
defender representatives from the public
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
defender are expected to staff and be
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
present at these courts throughout the
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
state and they do that however this
 
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.630 align:start position:0%
state and they do that however this
takes

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
takes
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
time process changes in the criminal
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
defense world have also impacted the
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
provision of indigent defense with the
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
end of felonies first there are now more
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
Courts for staff for attorneys to staff
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
at arraignments essentially we've gone
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
from having to staff 10 Superior Courts
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
which had arraignments at more or less
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
predictable times to over 30 circuit
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
courts which do not have the same level
 
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.109 align:start position:0%
courts which do not have the same level
of

00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
predictability that takes more time for
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
the the public
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
defender further cases now take longer
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
essentially by Design especially felony
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
cases every felony case for the most
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
part starts off in District Court
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
instead of Superior Court starts off
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
with an arraignment which must be
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
staffed and then a probable cause
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
hearing which is an additional hearing
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then the case is bound over to
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where the case
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
essentially starts again this takes
 
00:59:18.599 --> 00:59:20.390 align:start position:0%
essentially starts again this takes
additional

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
time these factors have led to case
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
loads remaining stubbornly high and
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
based on review the Accord to the
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
reports that I receive and monthly
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
reports every public defender office
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
currently has case loads above what the
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
contract goals
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
are to add to this the pay for public
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
defenders has not remained
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
competitive starting pay for public
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
defenders in New Hampshire lags behind
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
every single County Attorney office in
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
the state New Hampshire also has the
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
lowest public defender salary salaries
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
England the combination of the low pay
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
and the High case loads has led to
 
00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.829 align:start position:0%
and the High case loads has led to
Growing

00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
Growing
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
attrition and I've included a chart in
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
the handout which shows this attrition
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't fact skyrocketed at the public
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
defender and it's led to a vicious cycle
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers leave the public defender based
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
on low pay and high case loads that
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
leaves more work for those who remain
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
the public defender who are then also um
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
generally considering leaving the trend
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
that I've shown in the in the graph
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is continuing into this
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year my understand in is that 13
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
additional attorneys have given notice
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
since June 30th of this year for context
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's about 10% of the attorneys at
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
public defender just in the last four
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
months New Hampshire public defender
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
isn't just losing new lawyers but also
 
01:00:43.029 --> 01:00:43.039 align:start position:0%
more experienced attorneys the attorneys
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
who can take on the serious felonies
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
that the state needs them to take on and
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
these attorneys who are also vital to
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
training and mentoring the next
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
generation of
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys case loads and attrition are
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
already having an impact in counties
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
around the state for example New
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public defender has had to
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
scale back representing clients that
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
some incarcerated arraignments in some
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
counties and scale back on representing
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
clients at War and pickups in some
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
counties courts now can and do directly
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
appoint Council to represent uh
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
defendants in these cases as defendants
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional right under both
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire and a state
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
constitutions to council however when
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
courts directly assigned Council this is
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
more more expensive by far than having
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
public defenders do it but it puts
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
additional strain as well on the
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
contract and assigned Council system
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
which is already over
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
capacity because of all these factors
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
nhpd is the number one prioritize need
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
for the judicial Council the judicial
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
Council voted to recommend a substantial
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
increase in nhpd funding which is in my
 
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.069 align:start position:0%
increase in nhpd funding which is in my
schedule

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
D the prioritized need for nhpd was that
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
was voted on aimed to stabilize the
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
public defender by setting starting
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
salaries that are on par with County
 
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
attorney offices throughout the state as
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
well as adding additional attorneys to
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that case loads remain
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable and
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
sustainable the cost to increasing the
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
funding to nhbd would be far less than
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
having to fund the services that NBD
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
Council I should emphasize that because
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
the funding to the public defender is
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
made in contract form it needs to be up
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
allocated as part of the initial budget
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
in order for the program to plan and
 
01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.390 align:start position:0%
in order for the program to plan and
recruit

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
effectively besides the public defender
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
there are other prioritized needs I
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
would like to touch on first the
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
contract Council program contract
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
Council are attorneys who take a fixed
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
number of cases at a fixed rate the
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the contract program was to
 
01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
provide representation to defendants at
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
a more economical rate than assign
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
counsil however the contract program has
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
dropped off precipitously with fewer
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
than half the attorneys who used to take
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
cases now taking
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
cases if contract if the contract
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
program is going to remain an option the
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
system must be revitalized a new
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
proposed contract with simplifies term
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
simplified terms and increased
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
compensation needs to be finalized
 
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
submitted and approved but this would
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
require additional funding which is part
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
needs assigned Council funding is also a
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
prioritized need
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
as noted in the handout at any one time
 
01:03:32.269 --> 01:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire 20 to 40 defendants are
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
incarcerated on criminal charges without
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
Council sometimes these defendants are
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for weeks while awaiting
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
Council recent statutory changes have
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
made it unlawful to provide legal
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
services to children on a fixed fee
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
basis in essence this has increased the
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
number of cases that now must be handled
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
by assign Council again which
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
contributes to the prioritized need
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
request for assign
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
Council there are currently not enough
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys willing and qualified to
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
provide services at the current contract
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
hour the assigned Council line also
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
includes attorneys who provide services
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
to children and parents and abuse to
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
neglect in termination of parental
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
rights cases as well as guardianship
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
cases the number of these attorneys has
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
shrunk dramatically especially in rural
 
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.039 align:start position:0%
areas where there are now legal deserts
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
which you may have heard of from other
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
presentations essentially areas where
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
there are two few few attorneys to meet
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
the needs of their
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
residents because of this shortage of
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the lack of attorneys
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
willing to take on these cases the
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
judicial Council recommended that the
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court raise the rates for
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
assigned Council again currently at $90
 
01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:41.349 align:start position:0%
assigned Council again currently at $90
to

01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
$125 the advisory committee on the rules
 
01:04:45.309 --> 01:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
voted to recommend this change but this
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
potential change is still pending if
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
adopted this proposal would require
 
01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:51.269 align:start position:0%
adopted this proposal would require
additional

01:04:51.269 --> 01:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation which again is why it's
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
part of my prioritized needs package
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
not included on the handout but
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
nevertheless an important feature of the
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
budget is services
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
for a Services other than
 
01:05:07.269 --> 01:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
Council expenditures for services other
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
than Council have been steadily
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
Rising as outlined in the hand out cases
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
last longer and involve much more
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
data correspondingly there's been an
 
01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
increase in the use of experts in cases
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
translation services document management
 
01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.230 align:start position:0%
translation services document management
and

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
evaluations evaluations are now much
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
more more common in criminal cases
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
across the board and in other cases as
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
well this includes evaluations for
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
mental health drug addiction and others
 
01:05:36.269 --> 01:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
there's also been issues where due to
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
stabing shortages at the forensic
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
examiner certain competence evaluations
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
are now sought and paid for through
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
defense I'd like to also point out two
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
other agencies that judicial Council
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
supports and their budgetary needs first
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
Casa which stands for which is short for
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
guardian of excuse me court appointed
 
01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.029 align:start position:0%
guardian of excuse me court appointed
special

01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
Advocates kasas are volunteers Who
 
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
currently are comp excuse me Costas are
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers who provide services in abuse
 
01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:11.799 align:start position:0%
and neglect and tpr cases as part of my
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
role at the judicial Council have had
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to attend CA training
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
and also to observe Costas in
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
court I think it's important to
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
recognize that these are volunteers who
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
work extremely hard on what are very
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
difficult cases and their jeed to
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
cross-examination by trained lawyers
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
their training is excellent and the caes
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
that I've had opportunity to observe in
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
court are both professional and prepared
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
the state is incredibly fortunate to
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
have their use uh and to have volunteers
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
willing to work on these cases and their
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
work product based on my conversation
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
with judges who hear the cases is
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
incredibly important in determining the
 
01:06:51.789 --> 01:06:51.799 align:start position:0%
outcomes the priori prioritized need for
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
the casa line is aimed at meeting their
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
costs for Casa which are expected to
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
increase again these costs dealing with
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the Staffing and other resources they
 
01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:00.789 align:start position:0%
um the Staffing and other resources they
provide

01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
volunteers I'd also like to touch on
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
Assistance nhla New Hampshire legal
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
assistance provides a broad selection of
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
services on the Civil side to New
 
01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents most notably for
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
today I'd like to touch on their work in
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence their work is both
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
Innovative and efficient I had the
 
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to a court where nhla
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
had set up a domestic violence clinic
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
this Clinic was a model in providing
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
services when needed as needed to
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse victims anyone who's ever
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
spent time in a circuit court can see
 
01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:33.829 align:start position:0%
spent time in a circuit court can see
the

01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
people who really need help those people
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
are often searching for assistance and
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
assistance usually and they're usually
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
asking clerks for help and clerks really
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
aren't equipped to provide that kind of
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
help an nhla Domestic Violence Clinic is
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
a great example where they have lawyers
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
in the court who provide services to
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
someone who walks in whether they're off
 
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
the street or whether they've been
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
referred to by another source
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's an incredibly efficient use of
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
resources and the prioritized needs on
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
this line is aimed towards funding for
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
reopening a Nashville Office in a
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
populous area of the
 
01:08:10.029 --> 01:08:10.039 align:start position:0%
state I'd like to conclude by talking
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
about our agency budget
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
request as you can see in the
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
handout one recommendation from the
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
recent audit of the judicial Council was
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
for the hiring of a finance manager this
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
position would help the agency with
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
financial oversight but could also help
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
with needed changes to payment
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
processing and other
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
processes the judicial Council has been
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
working steadily to increase efficiency
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
and costs when it comes to the
 
01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
administration and funding of the
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
programs we support we have just today
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
sought and obtained Federal funding to
 
01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
improve our database and payment system
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
we have worked with the courts and lean
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
office to streamline the pce payment
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
processing for certain routine vendors
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
and to save time for judges and Court
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
staff we will be proposing changes to
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
rules in hb2 rules and statutes to
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
enable the judicial Council to negotiate
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
better and more uniform rates for
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
services which could save the state a
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
great deal of money when it comes to
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
Services other than Council as an agency
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
we remain committed to finding
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
efficiencies wherever
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
possible just like to conclude by
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
mentioning that the judicial Council
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
provides services to Citizens every day
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
in every Court in the state having had a
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
chance to review what the agency does as
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
as part of my introduction to this job I
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
can I'm very proud of the services we
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
provide however I do want to convey that
 
01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:31.239 align:start position:0%
the system as it currently stands is
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
under tremendous strain and cracks are
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
showing when adjusted for inflation nhpd
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
funding has actually gone down since
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
2014 I get calls every week and
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes every day from defendants who
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
are in jail asking why they don't have a
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer I hear from courts and
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
prosecutors asking why a defendant
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer I see experienced lawyers leaving
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public defender with no
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
easy replace
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
our budget is aimed at addressing these
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
issues and I thank you for for
 
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.510 align:start position:0%
issues and I thank you for for
considering

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh just looking over the
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
numbers your your your budget in in 2023
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
was was approximately 31 million and
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
that was increased to 37 million in
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 for about a 20% increase
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay and and with the
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
with the changes you're proposing
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
proposing now uh including the the
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs that would
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
bring it up to just just over 55 million
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
for an additional 48.6% increase I'd
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
have to double check because some of
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
those items included there is federal
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
funding that's dropped off as well but I
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
believe that is correct 55 million yes
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh my and that's just a
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
historic budget um statistics which I
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
love but uh my my my question really is
 
01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
as far as the public defenders
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh office goes in the need for the
 
01:10:58.159 --> 01:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
uh office goes in the need for the
public

01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
defenders uh obviously the public
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
defenders are there for people cannot
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise afford to
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
pay uh currently New Hampshire's economy
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
is in excellent shape we have
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
historically low unemployment 2.5% we're
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
the lowest uh we have the lowest uh
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
poverty rate in the country currently if
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
that were to change if we were to hit a
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
recession and we were to see
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment go up or like even if we
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
still are number one as far as uh our
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
poverty rate goes uh but that were to
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
increase as well could we
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
expect the need for the public defender
 
01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
office to increase even greater under
 
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.189 align:start position:0%
office to increase even greater under
those

01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances yes uh and just one point
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
of context the determination of who who
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
qualifies for a public defender in the
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
first instance is made by the courts by
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
under administrative rules from Das but
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
yes I think absolutely I think those
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
determinations on incy would would
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
likely increase
 
01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
likely increase
thank

01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
you hi good to see you I'm seeing a lot
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
of you today
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
um couple of questions one is um so the
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
way we budget judicial council is
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
remarkably fake in New Hampshire isn't
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
it um there's a footnote in the budget
 
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
that says we're going to give you X
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
number of dollars which is sort of made
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
up and um and you can go back to fiscal
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
and get as much as you need cuz we if I
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
understand this right and stop me if I
 
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
say something wrong if I understand this
 
01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
right there's a sixth amendment
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide etc etc um which
 
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
were currently not according to the LBA
 
01:12:38.110 --> 01:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
audit which we're failing on um not
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
failing in danger of I forget their
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
language it ain't going well um but so
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll budget 31 million and then
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
everyone Winks to themselves and goes we
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
know we're going to spend 40 and they'll
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
just go to fiscal and get it what what
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
have you spent the last actually spent
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
numbers on on public defender on let's
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
say public defender let's start there
 
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
well we spent exactly what's been for
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
the public defender I think the there's
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
been small lapses but we spent
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
essentially what's ever been allocated
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
with small and the extra is usually a
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
signed councel or contract
 
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
councel we've spent I know since I was
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
here last for the last budget cycle we
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
spent far over what was allocated to
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
assign Council because of that cork
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
which you just mentioned the you know
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
the allocation was lower than I think
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
what was expected and we predictively
 
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
came to to to come back to the fiscal
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
committee to ask for more so do I
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
understand your request correctly that
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
um if I understand this right based on
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
2023 case
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
loads it would be $47 million at current
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
rates and if we rais the rates it would
 
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
be more than that I'm looking at page
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
two of your presentation if you the of
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
that is to show what would it cost
 
01:13:58.629 --> 01:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
correct if you just did it as a sign
 
01:13:59.910 --> 01:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
Council if you got rid of the public
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
defender and did it as a sign Council it
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
would cost 47 million so every public
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
defender case worth sort of saving money
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
is that fair to say in fact if there's
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
one thing I could convey you're saving a
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
lot of money with a public defender case
 
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the numbers and
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
there's just one takeaway I can put
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
forward the public defender because of
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be funded upfront because of
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
the way it operates it's a you know it
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
has a two-year cycle and it needs to
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
hire people and do all that and it's an
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
organization if it doesn't get that uo
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
funding um it can't obviously plan and
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
the if it if instead of we're paying
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
things through assign counsel we're
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
paying essentially twice as much per
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
case even though so it might look like
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
The Upfront cost is lower but the
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
overall cost is much much higher and
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm trying to demonstrate so
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at that handout basically if
 
01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
you took if you took the cases that the
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
public defender does and you were to pay
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
all those cases simply as ass signed
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
Council which just to be clear you
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't do because there not but just
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
just for out of curiosity you say okay
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
we're just doing assign Council all the
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
way um it would be about double the cost
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
and that I think is due to the
 
01:15:07.229 --> 01:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
efficiencies involved in just simply
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
having one administrative unit you know
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
which is the public defender and the way
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
they handle things
 
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
um when I look at the numbers for
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
assigned Council those numbers are
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
wildly unpredictable and they go up a
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
lot um and they depend simply and they
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
can go up a lot based on big cases as
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
well I mean frankly if you're talking
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
pure economics the real savings in a
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
public defender office is on those
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
bigger cases because one big case a YDC
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
criminal defense case for example can be
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
six figures and that's just onest that's
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
for lawyer costs and add on top of that
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
um expert costs as well so
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
um if there's one big takeaway assigned
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
council is much more expensive and
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's been known for quite some time
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why under statute it's sort
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
of supposed to be the last resort but
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
because the contract system has you know
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
basically withered to a great degree ass
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
Council has really taken off and those
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
costs have grown my big concern right
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
now is if the public defender isn't
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
funded adequately those costs are going
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
to just explode even more and that's
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
just leaving aside the Constitutional
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
issue which is there aren't enough
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
lawyers and that the issue of people in
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
jail um without lawyers is going to go
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
up as well how long can you keep
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
somebody in jail without giving them a
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer uh that is a question that Oregon
 
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:25.669 align:start position:0%
lawyer uh that is a question that Oregon
says

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
Oregon says seven days um different
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
courts have that's a federal that's a
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
federal decision in Oregon um do we
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
exceed s days periodically yes
 
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.870 align:start position:0%
exceed s days periodically yes
routinely

01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes and is the concern that at some
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
point a court will look at that and um
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
be disappointed in
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
US yes okay probably more than
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
disappointed in US
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
the public defender if I understand the
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
public defender right I don't how big is
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
the public defender's office ballpark
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
attorney wise on 120 to 124 excuse me
 
01:17:07.149 --> 01:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
122 I think currently it's 134 I have
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
the the training person here I give you
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
the exact number but somewhere between
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
120 and 140 and and the way New
 
01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does it is is it is a it is a
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporation whose entire
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
income is derived from one bi anal Grant
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
from the state is that correct
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
essentially yes with some small other
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
but for the most part yes um it wouldn't
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
be efficient to make it a department of
 
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.709 align:start position:0%
be efficient to make it a department of
state

01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
government we probably have to pay
 
01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
more I don't have data on that point I
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
simp going on what what we look at right
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
now I haven't run that analysis I only
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
look at sort of the statutory options I
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
have currently which really are
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and um assign counsil but you
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
don't think that's an inefficient
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
Arrangement that with the one we have
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
today or or does
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
it I would say that it's much more
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
efficient than assigned counsel much
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
more efficient than contract counsel
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
whether it be more efficient to have it
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
as a state agency or not that's not a
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
calculation I've done yeah I'm guessing
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
probably not but that's my guess can you
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about Casa yes if we
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's in need of a casa
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
person Kasa is a wonderful organization
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
that does great work for the well for
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
everybody but um if Casa doesn't have
 
01:18:23.719 --> 01:18:25.510 align:start position:0%
everybody but um if Casa doesn't have
somebody

01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
what happens then that is an excellent
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
question which I should have included in
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
my report essentially what happens is if
 
01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
Casa cannot staff someone the case then
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
goes to a a non-cost of G and they are
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
essentially compensated as a signed
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
Council and whereas Casa
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
is not compensated at that rate correct
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
so we pay Casa you know we give them a
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
fixed amount of money for training and
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
for Staffing um again not Staffing but
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
Staffing that they support attorneys um
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
whereas U yeah we don't pay we don't pay
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
their their volunteers do not send us a
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
bill whereas the non-asa Gils do they
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
send us a bill just like an attorney
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
would essentially so we're sort of
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
saving money hand over fist um with Casa
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
is that a fair statement that's uh
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
you any other questions thank you very
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
Labor afternoon
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner good afternoon um for the

O'Hara for me for prepared remarks I
 
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
only get to do this every couple of
 
01:19:59.910 --> 01:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
years or so
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
so the uh the department consists of
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
three divisions Administration which
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
includes department-wide efforts like
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
Legal Services finance and Human
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%

vessel law and the elevator and
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
accessibility lift law uh also safety
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
and health laws uh and along with these
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
statutes the division also enforces
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
administrative rules uh dealing with the
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
very same subject matter in a typical
 
01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
year the Inspection Division will
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
recover anywhere from a half million to
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
a million dollars in wages for New
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employees uh completes uh
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
roughly a thousand uh labor inspections
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
of various
 
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
types uh completes roughly 10,000 boiler
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
or pressure vessel inspections and uh
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
over 5,000 elevator inspections the
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
division is also proactive training
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
employers every year on employment law
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
to assist them with their legal
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
compliance uh since the pandemic the
 
01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:23.639 align:start position:0%
division has made excellent use of
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
webinar technology
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
to provide these trainings in a virtual
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
environment division leadership and
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
Department leadership also uh provide

maintain insurance coverage to provide
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
no fault compensation for employees in

01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
the uh worker Compensation Division
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
collects first reports of injury from
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
employers and insurance carriers in New
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regarding the roughly 40,000
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
or so workplace injuries that occur each
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
year it schedules over uh, 1500 for
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
normal hearings per year and manages
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
revolving trust fund Collections and
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
payments uh that can be as high as 20
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
million doar a year and as as you can
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
see that is almost doubled the entire
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
operating budget of of the department uh
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
while the Department's total
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are funded 100% by agency
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
income that revenue is actually derived
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
through two distinct sources first the
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
administration fund and secondly the
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
restricted fund the administration fund
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
is described in RSA 281a col 59 and it
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
comes from a prata assessment of the
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
Department's approved annual budget for
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
worker compensation activities that is
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
then levied on the workers compensation
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and self-insured
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
entities in New Hampshire this
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
assessment actually uh for the the first
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
year of the new bium uh in our request
 
01:23:25.149 --> 01:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
represents 87% of our total
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
Department the restricted fund on the
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
other hand is described in RSA
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
273 colon 1B and it comes from the sum
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
of all other fees fines licenses uh
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
civil penalties uh certificates uh all
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
the other revenue of the department that
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
is not associated with worker
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
compensation uh and the
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
balance remaining after our expens enses
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the restricted fund the balance is
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
transferred to the general fund at the
 
01:24:02.669 --> 01:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
end of each fiscal year and uh I can
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
report that the last four years have
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
been the best four years in terms of
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
that general fund
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
transfer uh exceeding in fact last state
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year exceeding $2
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
million uh the governor's office
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
provided us an overall efficiency Target
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
of 12 Mill just over $12 million in year
 
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
one the adjusted year 2 Target
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
was 12.4 Million after allowances for
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
position cost
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections uh the labor department has
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
met both targets with our efficiency
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
budget request and uh while we have
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
requested no new positions for fiscal 26
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
or 27 uh leaving us with 87 full-time
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
authorized positions as supported in the
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
prior bium uh we did uh in order to meet
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
efficiency targets and maintain some uh
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
operational uh efficiency we did uh
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
freeze the funding for three positions
 
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
in in the next
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
bium uh notable changes in our
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
efficiency request for for the coming
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
bium include a slight increase in class
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
17 uh special payments which we use to
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
fund uh retirement payouts or uh when
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
someone terminates State service they're
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
they're entitled also to a payout so
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
allows us to do that without impacting
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
our salary lines um I did a calculation
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday I think if if everyone were to
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
leave and everyone eligible to retire it
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be on the order of
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
$300,000 and um so we've asked for
 
01:25:41.629 --> 01:25:41.639 align:start position:0%
significantly less than that because we
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that that'll happen
 
01:25:49.629 --> 01:25:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh um also uh let's see we have uh
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
significant reductions in our transfers
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
to doit and to General services so thank
 
01:25:59.109 --> 01:25:59.119 align:start position:0%
you Charlie thank you Dennis uh we have
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
an increase in equipment in year one for
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
the purchase of a new truck to
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
facilitate the transport of elevator
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
testing weights uh I have learned in uh
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
recent days that we are transporting
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
something like 1,400 pound of testing
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
weights for elevators in um little
 
01:26:23.679 --> 01:26:24.830 align:start position:0%
weights for elevators in um little
sedans

01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
sedans
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes subcompacts and it's tearing
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles apart so in order to save
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
those Vehicles we'd like to we'd like to
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
purchase a truck that's better capable
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
of doing that um we also had a we've had
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
a significant increase in indirect costs
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh to cover the large increases that
 
01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
we've experienced in Statewide cost
 
01:26:51.310 --> 01:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
allocation plan costs virtually double
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
what what we budgeted uh La uh year
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
before last so
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
um yes and uh We've significantly
 
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
reduced the budget for part-time
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
temporary staffing but increased the
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
budget for our administratively attached
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
boards uh a couple of the boards that
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
are attached the labor department
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
receive per DM costs and travel costs uh
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
for their service and um my concern
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
there is not that uh U you know the
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
current trend is less than budget uh how
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
however if I don't have funding in those
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
lines the the result could be that uh
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
citizens are waiting for services that
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
they they should be getting timely by
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
law um so I like to protect a little bit
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
in that class line uh We've also asked
 
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
for uh an increase in year one for our
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
class uh 103 operational
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
contracts um again we haven't made great
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
use of this but but I envision
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we would like to
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
fund um projects within the Spalding
 
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
building including uh redesign of of
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
work areas there are some other needs
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that we have in the building I
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
found commissioner Arling house is a lot
 
01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
more receptive to my requests when I pay
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
for them so um that's what I have in
 
01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.189 align:start position:0%
for them so um that's what I have in
mind

01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh we we also do have uh some small
 
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
prior well relatively small prioritize
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
needs uh amounting in uh to less than
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
$330,000 throughout the bium uh those
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
were both requested by doit and admin
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
Services they're they're not um
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
specifically our requests and that
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
questions questions I have lots of
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
questions oh good I didn't know what I
 
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
was going to do with my afternoon
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
Charlie no it's very important
 
01:28:55.709 --> 01:28:55.719 align:start position:0%
um uh you're administrative lapse which
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
I think was 2.8 million last year so
 
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
your modest was almost three
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm asking this because it's a there
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
are a bunch of other agencies where when
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
they have these these fees etc etc they
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
keep rolling them over and over and over
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
again and they they don't lapse anything
 
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
they just roll which obviously if you're
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
doing a Statewide budget is less than
 
01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
ideal although it's great for that
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
agency um you keep it do you have like a
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
do you have an amount you keep in in
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
Balance like the first 100 Grand you
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
keep and the rest you
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
lapse or do you just lapse It
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
All We lapse everything from the
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
restricted fund that's what I mean but
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
but I would I would call your attention
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
to the administration fund which again
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
is like 87% of our request that rolls
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
into the next year and depresses the
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
assessment for the workers comp
 
01:29:53.109 --> 01:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and that's the that's
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the thing where we do we're essentially
 
01:29:57.310 --> 01:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
Dunning carriers for the cost of that
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
but for the rest of it you're lapsing a
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
good amount of money yep um and that's
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
from various fees and whatnot that's
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
every other type of Revenue that we
 
01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
collect other than the billing for the
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers for workers comp
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
every other fee that we collect at the
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
end of the year whatever we haven't
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
needed to support our expenses is
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
transfer and you you laps the whole
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
thing yeah yeah okay I'm not critical of
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
that I just in the back of my mind I
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
think it might work other places too um
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
excellent I'm happy to assist with that
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that secondly I wanted
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about in in an earlier point in
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
the day I was talking to somebody about
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
um things like hearing officers you do a
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
lot of Fairly complicated cases I think
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
with hearing officers I I would say so
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
I've been told differently by other
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
hearings officers but but uh uh yes uh a
 
01:30:57.629 --> 01:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
number like the statutes that I cited
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
you know any number of those would would
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
come up in a hearing setting and worker
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
compensation being the bulk of the
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
hearings that we conduct and which are
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
often fairly complicated I would argue
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
so yes okay and it's one I think we
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
called them administrative law judges
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
now indeed um and it's typically how
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's there's one judge both parties
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
present and that he or she then
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicates and writes an opinion
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
renders a decision within 30 days and
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
within 30 days and you stick to that
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
pretty good within 30 days yeah very
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
very well in fact during the pandemic I
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't think we had a single late here we
 
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:42.280 align:start position:0%
held hearings on time and we produce
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
decisions on time it's a very it's a
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
very rare circumstance that we're late
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
because the law says we can't be so okay
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
and as the star of elevators everywhere
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
um there are some states in which the
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Labor when he
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
inspects an elevator doesn't just have
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
his signature on it but also his picture
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
I've been told have you considered that
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
option I have not seriously considered
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
you like to invite up now the public
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon uh my name
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
is Doug ingersol I'm the executive
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
director of the Public Employee Labor
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
Relations Board I've been with the board
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
since 2006 I work with two other
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and the board itself
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh consists of nine authorized positions
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
we currently have seven board members
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
and two
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies um I'd like to divide my very
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
brief comments today into two parts one
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh a few words about operations and then
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
two a few comments about our budget
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
requests uh in terms of operations I
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
circulated an information sheet which
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
hits uh the major activity areas we are
 
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering the
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
state's public sector collective
 
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining law which affects employers
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
at the state county City Municipal
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
School District levels employers and
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
employees who work in those
 
01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
areas we currently have upwards of 600
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining units in place which
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
corresponds to uh a similar number of
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
contracts that are negotiated between
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
those parties uh usually every one to
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
three years depending on their contract
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
term uh and then under our statute um if
 
01:34:20.109 --> 01:34:20.119 align:start position:0%
there are potential conflicts and Labor
 
01:34:23.109 --> 01:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
Relations uh covered by the statute
 
01:34:24.990 --> 01:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
parties are free to file complaints with
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
us and we have a hearing process uh we
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
also look at bargaining unit composition
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
not only when new units are formed but
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
to make adjustments by adding or using
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
positions we typically use a hearing
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
officer for that
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
process uh we also have a panel of
 
01:34:46.990 --> 01:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
neutrals who work as arbitrators
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
FactFinder uh and mediators in contract
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
negotiations um
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
I listened to to Michelle lebrun's
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
presentation her and and the comment
 
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
about her status as the longest serving
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
state employee uh her mother uh Evelyn I
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
think was the first uh executive
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
director of our board and served from
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
the 1970s through
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
1990 um and I think left quite a
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
legacy um in terms of the uh budget
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
request itself uh it's pretty consistent
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
with what we've asked for in Prior years
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh there is a defunding of one of our
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
positions to meet the Target that we
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
were given by the governor's
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
office um that position is currently
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
vacant anyway but certainly spoils any
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
plans I may have had to uh bring a
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
person on board uh in the near-
 
01:35:45.199 --> 01:35:47.350 align:start position:0%
person on board uh in the near-
term

01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
um I have included a request to increase
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
a board per DM to $250
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
and we'll follow the hb2 protocol uh
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
discussed in a recent email from budget
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
director Gary for that but the original
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
board per DM in 1976 was $25 it was
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
doubled to $50 in 1985 and it's stayed
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
there ever since
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
so the net to a board member for a full
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
day's work is
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
$37 obviously those pdms are not meant
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
um as a a living wage or full
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
compensation to board members most of
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
them are otherwise employed
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
professionals um but they do deal with
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
some difficult cases and some difficult
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
issues and they work hard to to make
 
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
fair and correct decisions and I think
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh to bring the to raise the
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
per DM up to the $250 level which I
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
think is still fairly modest um and it's
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
the first time I've submitted such a
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
request I I don't know if there was ever
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
a request prior to 2006 to address that
 
01:37:04.719 --> 01:37:06.229 align:start position:0%
a request prior to 2006 to address that
amount

01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
um class uh 27 doit the only real change
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
there is we have implemented legal files
 
01:37:16.750 --> 01:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
case management software and so going
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
forward there's going to be an on
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing carrying cost associated with
 
01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
licenses which is around 6,00 000 a year
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I think the money necessary to
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
implement and get training configuration
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
completed is covered in our fiscal year
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
2425 budget and that whole process is
 
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
going well uh and we have been using
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
that new software since
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
July uh Board of tax and land appeals
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
apparently has been using it for over 20
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
years and I believe there are another
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
other small boards and departments that
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
may also be uh working on cont tracks
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
with legal
 
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
files um when we re eliminated funding
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
for the position that I mentioned it
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
created the opportunity to include some
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
funds uh for equipment um to to address
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
our hearing room tables and chairs I had
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
included funding for that in fiscal year
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
24 hadn't done research ahead of time
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
and found out the funds that I had
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
available were wellfully inadequate to
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
address our our equipment needs so uh
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
there is funding in there uh for both
 
01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:33.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal years and I think you will see in
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
authorized fiscal year 25 that that
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
number was
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
Zero um normally we don't we don't have
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
much demand for for equipment but those
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
are the highlights I don't really have
 
01:38:45.199 --> 01:38:45.950 align:start position:0%
are the highlights I don't really have
any

01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
other specific things I want to bring to
 
01:38:51.629 --> 01:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
your attention happy to answer any
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
questions Ju Just an update if you you
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
could provide one I know as you
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your report that you just
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
switched over on July 1 to a to a new
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
case management system how's that how is
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
that going and what your experience with
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that we've obtained full
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
proficiency but we put a lot of work in
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the spring uh working with the vendor
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
on training and
 
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
configuration and because we were
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
configuring A system that we didn't
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
understand it wasn't like going to buy
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
another a new car that now had AC we
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
were buying something we didn't
 
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
understand how it was going to work
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
except based on anecdotal information
 
01:39:34.510 --> 01:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
and a a brief video uh demonstration but
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy with it I think it
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually has increased our efficiencies
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of managing information that
 
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
comes in tracking our docket keeping
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
track of the small things that have to
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
happen every day to keep the docket
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
moving and make sure that things aren't
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
missed uh so I I would support anybody
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
who was running an operation similar to
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
ours uh using it I think it has to be it
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
seems to be geared toward a legal based
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh system uh and if it's more of a
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
business administration type environment
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate thank
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
you I would note um I don't think
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a comprehensive study of
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
part-time adjudicative boards in the
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
state but um compensation for them seems
 
01:40:27.390 --> 01:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
to be all over the map and um I would
 
01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
say you're among the
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
lowest um not quite the lowest I think
 
01:40:34.350 --> 01:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
the board of claims who gets like 45
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
bucks a quarter whether they have cases
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
or not which is the equivalent of a part
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
of a volunteer job if you ask me um is
 
01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
probably the lowest and the Personnel
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
appeals board might be the highest
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
because I think they also get a weekly
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
stipend but um I suspect that as maybe
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
as a result of your request there might
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
be some interest in looking at that uh
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
looking at some Equity Statewide and and
 
01:40:59.550 --> 01:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
how that I I do understand um am I right
 
01:41:02.270 --> 01:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
about your board that um board members
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
don't write the decisions you do that's
 
01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
correct and that's probably a good
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
system because you kind of know what
 
01:41:09.790 --> 01:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing let's assume you know what
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing it seems to work pretty
 
01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
well okay and uh but if anyone's
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
listening who has an interest in it I
 
01:41:19.950 --> 01:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
think it's something where we might want
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
to look at some sort of equity Statewide
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
because even the part-time boards
 
01:41:26.109 --> 01:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
there's no equity as opposed to the
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
couple of full-time boards
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
where yeah I I mean any anybody serving
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
on any board in the state is making a
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
commitment um but there are definitely I
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
think occasions when the work required
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
and the stress involved is maybe higher
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
than was
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated I've been pretty fortunate
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
fortunate with my board I feel like
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
they've always maintained their
 
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
composure and had a good attitude about
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
getting the work done and I I don't
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
think the $50 per DM is going to be a
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
breaking point but I think an adjustment
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
is probably
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
overdue and I just want to clarify I'm
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
right about this I think that you're the
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%

lot of slides um but um would like to
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%

maybe nine slides in front of you and on
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
slide two this is a screenshot of page
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
3,879 in your budget book The University
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
system is one very large appropriation
 
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
line generally funded in the state
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
budget and um as directed by the
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the department of
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
administra administrative Services the
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
request for fiscal years 26 and 27 7 is
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
91.2 million it represents um a 4%
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
reduction over the current level of our
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
block grant an 8% reduction if you
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
include that onetime funding that the
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
university system was appropriated in
 
01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.149 align:start position:0%
university system was appropriated in
fiscal

01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
24 um this is not what we would have um
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
requested out of the gate as a
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
recovering auditor from my many years at
 
01:49:51.310 --> 01:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
the LBA audit division I generally
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
follow the rules and we requested what
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
um the direction was provided uh by the
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office and administrative
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
Services we would like to see that
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation flat at $95 million in
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
each of the next two fiscal years to
 
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
continue the work that is happening at
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
the University system I'll get into that
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
in a minute we um very much rely on the
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
state support appreciate the levels of
 
01:50:22.189 --> 01:50:22.199 align:start position:0%
State support that benefit our New
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students and families and the
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
programs that are um mandated by
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
Statute in order to make up this
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
reduction in state support if we were
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
going to make that up in in state with
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
instate tuition that would be about a 6%
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
increase in instate tuition which we we
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
cannot do the the market would not bear
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
that type of tuition increase and we
 
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
would not increase tuition at those
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
amounts to to um make up that
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
reduction on on slide three want to just
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
mention what the state investment is
 
01:51:05.239 --> 01:51:06.109 align:start position:0%
mention what the state investment is
used

01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:51:06.119 --> 01:51:08.310 align:start position:0%
used
for

01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:51:12.390 --> 01:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
we allocate almost the entirety of the
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
state investment toward buying down
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
instate tuition instate tuition runs
 
01:51:19.069 --> 01:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
about half of what out of state tuition
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
runs because of increased State
 
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:23.030 align:start position:0%
runs because of increased State
investment

01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
over the past half dozen years we've
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
been able to keep tuition flat actually
 
01:51:30.069 --> 01:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
the net tuition paid by our New
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students has dropped by 6.7%
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
over the last 5 years because financial
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
aid has increased and um tuition has
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
stayed flat and I'm going to show you in
 
01:51:44.669 --> 01:51:44.679 align:start position:0%
a minute that that has finally paid off
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the fall of
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
24 the um the other portion of the the
 
01:51:55.470 --> 01:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
state investment is allocated to provide
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
partial um funding for statutory
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
mandated programs so Cooperative
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
Extension um agricultural experiment
 
01:52:06.030 --> 01:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
station and the list you'll find on page
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
three there are other state mandated
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
programs that aren't included here that
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
we fund out of our budget the National
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
Guard tuition waivers for example those
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
were about $3 million just shy of $3
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
million last year as well as um tuition
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
waivers for Foster children so those are
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
other mandated programs that we need to
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
cover out of the
 
01:52:31.709 --> 01:52:31.719 align:start position:0%
budget over those these past six years
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
the state investment has increased 7.3%
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
which is Meaningful right from the 85 A5
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
million to the 95 million um and you'll
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
see in a minute our enrollment is
 
01:52:44.350 --> 01:52:44.360 align:start position:0%
declining I'm not going to say our
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment is not declining because it
 
01:52:50.109 --> 01:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
it is so if you will flip
 
01:52:55.229 --> 01:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
to slide four I do want to we we
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
are partnering closely with the Bia
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
community college system employers
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
around the state I'm going to get into a
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
little more detail in a moment about
 
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
that but one of the policy priorities of
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
the Bia for 24 is to explore ways that
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
we can increase support for public
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
higher education to keep more New
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students here and in the fall
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
of 24 for the first time since
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
2013 the university system New Hampshire
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
the first time class in of New Hampshire
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
students increased
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
2.8% which in this competitive
 
01:53:33.149 --> 01:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
environment I believe is partially
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
because of the state investment that has
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
been made and we've been able to keep
 
01:53:40.149 --> 01:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
tuition low so that is in my mind a good
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
thing for our students our families our
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
employers at the same time our
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
surrounding states are really doubling
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
down on investment because all of New
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
England is experiencing this this
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
demographic Challenge and all states are
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
trying to keep their students or frankly
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
take our students um to bolster their
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
future Workforce and economy and I'll
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
talk about a little bit more about that
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
in a minute so Slide Five graphic where
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
you see the New
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident student increasing in
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
the fall of 2004 now again I don't want
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
this slide to imply that enrollment grew
 
01:54:24.669 --> 01:54:24.679 align:start position:0%
it did not our enrollment continues to
 
01:54:27.149 --> 01:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
decline because of demographic pressures
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
we expect it will continue to decline
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
and we're taking action I'll again get
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
into a little more um excuse me detail
 
01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:36.149 align:start position:0%
into a little more um excuse me detail
about

01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
that my my worry with this demographic
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
and the market competition for young
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
talent in New
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
England certainly is for the University
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
system but more importantly what does it
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
look like as our population ages for the
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
future Workforce future economy when the
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
the population of young Talent is
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
shrinking and H how do we continue to
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
compete and um be an attractive
 
01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
affordable quality opportunity for
 
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire and in in the
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
region oh my next slide on slide six is
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
just more good news that the
 
01:55:22.750 --> 01:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
demographics in New England are are
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
projected to continue to decline so the
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
we expect that if we can hold enrollment
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
flat that would be a win es again
 
01:55:36.069 --> 01:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
especially in New
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
England and the university system is not
 
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
waiting for the next shoe to drop we are
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
not expecting the state to bail us out
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
of of this challenge that we know is
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
it's here and coming we are taking
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
significant action
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
and will plan to it will continue to
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
take bold action because we have to
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
change just about everything everything
 
01:56:07.310 --> 01:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
about the way we're delivering Services
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
the size of our footprint all of
 
01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
that so on slide seven I just have a few
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
examples of what we've done over the
 
01:56:19.069 --> 01:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
past few years so while inflation has
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
grown 20% over those um over the past
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
three years our expenses have increased
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
3% how have we done some of that our um
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff headcount has reduced
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
we've reduced employer contributions to
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
our we don't belong to the retirement
 
01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
system because we're not a state agency
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
but we have a it's a 403b it's like a
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
401k we've reduced our employer
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
contributions match we've reduced our
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
medical plans and increased our premiums
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
we've um we no longer provide employer
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
cont contributions toward vision and
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
dental we are demolishing buildings we
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
are selling buildings we are exiting
 
01:57:01.750 --> 01:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
leases this is all part of we know we
 
01:57:03.629 --> 01:57:03.639 align:start position:0%
have to reduce the cost structure and we
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
are taking action to do so we've also
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
invested in new technology we go live
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
with workday for HR and Finance in about
 
01:57:18.310 --> 01:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
necessary the
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
um the next slides are really examples
 
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
about the competition that we're facing
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
around in the region slide
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
eight you may have seen Billboards that
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
UMaine has on the highways come to
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
UMaine for the same price that you pay

in state tuition Sunni is doing the same
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
thing um the Commonwealth of

commonwealth
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
commitment again just increasing the

competition across the region
 
01:57:53.950 --> 01:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me on slide
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
nine we are fully
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
embedded I will
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
say we are not the isolated
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic Ivory Tower that some may
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
have in their minds from many many years
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
ago we are fully embedded with thousands
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
of employers across the state with the
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%

Rubenstein and I are spending a lot of
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
quality time together we are embedded
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise beholden to ourselves and
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are just some examples on the
 
01:58:39.310 --> 01:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
slide and I have lots more um I firmly
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
believe that the university all of
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
public higher ed is a critical part of
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
the state's future um we are the
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
university system was the inaugural
 
01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:49.719 align:start position:0%

strategy internship programs with our
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
institutions is where it's at if we
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
non-resident students are twice as
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
likely to stay and work here if they're
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
in an internship program so partnering
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
with employers again thousands of
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
employers across the state to get our
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
students into internships and I
 
01:59:19.470 --> 01:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Partnerships with the
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
a 100 Pathways between the community
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%

01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
now have a direct admission program we
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
are collaborating on multiple
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
administrative fronts um actually the
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
university system office is moving to
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
the nhti campus in 2025 really trying to
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
um leverage scale wherever possible to
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
benefit students in the citizenry
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
through public um higher
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
ed and then on on slide 10 I just want
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
to close with some Innovation that's
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
happening at our institutions um you may
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
have recently read that Plymouth State
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
applied through um our New England

02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
five areas you'll see those on the first
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
bullet of the slide again thinking about
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
meeting our students where they are
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
delivering what students need um Keen
 
02:00:21.149 --> 02:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
State this is interesting Senator gray
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
and I just have we had a board meeting
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
over at Keen State a couple weeks ago
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
and Senator gray and I sat at a table
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
with some Executives from um Diamond
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
turning I'm going to get the terminology
 
02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
wrong Advanced
 
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies over in the
 
02:00:39.629 --> 02:00:39.639 align:start position:0%
madok region there are over half a dozen
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
of them and they're the global
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
leader in providing this diamond turning
 
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
Advanced manufacturing Precision
 
02:00:52.109 --> 02:00:52.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and Keen state
 
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
is the only four-year college that has
 
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
been selected to partner with the
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
American Center for Optics manufacturing
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
and through some outside funding Keane
 
02:01:02.510 --> 02:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
is completing a diamond turning Optics
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
lab again to collaborate with that
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
industry over in the madok region that's
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
employing over a thousand people it's
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
it's quite
 
02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
remarkable um UNH research for an
 
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
institution its size it's a it's a
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
powerhouse it's
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's um it's surprising the other thing
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
about unh
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
the goal is to provide the undergrad
 
02:01:27.550 --> 02:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
student opportunity to work on that
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
research not just let have the
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
researchers off um on their own it's
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's quite unique and then I'm I'm
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
not sure if you're aware of the John
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
olssen Advanced manufacturing center at
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
UNH um they provide learning
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities they have a remarkable
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
equipment High School community college
 
02:01:50.189 --> 02:01:50.199 align:start position:0%
students small startups all all come
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
together in that Advanced manufacturing
 
02:01:54.430 --> 02:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
center over in Durham and it's it's
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
UNH I'm going to close with that to give
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
you plenty of time to ask me questions
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I I will just say that the university
 
02:02:11.550 --> 02:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
system is a remarkable resource to all
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
the citizens of the state and
 
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
I I do not envy the position you are in
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
I was state treasur
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
2011 and that was a very very difficult
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
budget period And
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
I so I can identify and I I
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult decisions but I
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
believe that public highed needs to be
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
part of where we're heading in the
 
02:02:43.950 --> 02:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
future with Workforce Employers in the
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
economy so I appreciate your time and
 
02:02:48.830 --> 02:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Chancellor
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh my question revolves around tuition
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if you could uh talk
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
about what you've been what historically
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
what you've done with tuition both in
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
state and out of state and maybe your
 
02:03:03.870 --> 02:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
projections for the future for the next
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
few years as far as where that where
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's going so we have held tuition
 
02:03:12.669 --> 02:03:12.679 align:start position:0%
flat for instate students for the past
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
six years this is the sixth year and
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
we've done that well you can see on
 
02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:22.069 align:start position:0%
we've done that well you can see on
Slide

02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
Slide
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
three we've done that because the state
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
um continued to
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
invest additional dollars each year um
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the okay wait I didn't
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
answerer the next part of your question
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
sorry for non-resident students we have
 
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
consistently raised tuition about 2 and
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
a half% per year so I'm I'm rounding but
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
out of state tuition is about double
 
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
what instate tuition is sticker price
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
not discounted with financial aid um and
 
02:04:00.669 --> 02:04:00.679 align:start position:0%
again because the State dollars buy that
 
02:04:02.669 --> 02:04:02.679 align:start position:0%
tuition down for our instate
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
students for next fiscal year for the
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
next academic
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
year starting in the fall of
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
25 our board just voted two weeks ago to
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
increase in state tuition by 2 and a
 
02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:24.189 align:start position:0%
increase in state tuition by 2 and a
half%

02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
up to oh yes I'm sorry yes Senator
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely Senator gray thank you for
 
02:04:32.669 --> 02:04:32.679 align:start position:0%
that that um that point the motion is
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
always up to a maximum of 2 and a half%
 
02:04:40.830 --> 02:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
so depending on what happens depending
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
on all kinds of things
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
competition we can go lower than that
 
02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
but the board sets a cap on the increase
 
02:04:48.599 --> 02:04:50.310 align:start position:0%
but the board sets a cap on the increase
in

02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
pricing as you you've consistently
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
raised by by the 2 and a half% for out
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
ofate tuition and kept instate tuition
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
flat have you notied the ratio of
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
students between out of state and
 
02:05:04.629 --> 02:05:04.639 align:start position:0%
instate changed significantly over that
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
time period meaning are out of state
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
tuition students dropping off at a
 
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
five enrollment that's that's a tricky
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
I will say the percentage has been
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
fairly consistent until this
 
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
fall when resident students went up and
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
non-resident students went
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
down um and that could be for many
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
reasons I I um it could be because other
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
states are investing heavily to keep
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
their students
 
02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
there it it probably is partly because
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
we've te kept tuition flat for so long
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
we're not we're sorry we're no longer
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
the low the highest instate tuition in
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
New England Vermont is now you know we
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
used to be able we used to that used to
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
be oh we're the highest in state it's
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
still high I don't want to minimize that
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
we still have high in state tuition but
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're not the highest
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
anymore um and it could partially be
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
because of the fafs of
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
fiasco so there are multiple things that
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
could have caused this Divergence in
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
this chart um
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
but I I think it's a uh I think it's a
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
factors I just wonder if you could
 
02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
finally if you could just touch on that
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
in the financial aid and the and the I
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
would use the word fiasco that that
 
02:06:40.549 --> 02:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
schools across this nation went through
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh this past summer and and and fall and
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
the impact they might have had on the
 
02:06:49.350 --> 02:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
University system so um it we think it
 
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
definitely had an impact on the
 
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
University system Frank we think all of
 
02:06:54.790 --> 02:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
higher red because students we have a
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
high percentage of students who are
 
02:06:58.709 --> 02:06:58.719 align:start position:0%
considered first generation students you
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
might um actually the new president of
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
unh just had an op-ed in the union
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
leader a week or so ago about first
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
generation students who may not have the
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
supports at home to to navigate the
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
complicated Journey right of applying to
 
02:07:18.189 --> 02:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
college and financial aid and the FAFSA
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:23.800 align:start position:0%
well the FAFSA was not available when it
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
should have
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
been um the depart US Department of Ed
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
did not release the
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
new simplified FAFSA timely and then
 
02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
what happened was schools didn't have
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
the data to prepare financial aid
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
packaging for
 
02:07:45.470 --> 02:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
students so students didn't have the
 
02:07:46.629 --> 02:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
information they needed to make a
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
decision and we know that many students
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
and families gave up actually granted
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're familiar with
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
that nonprofit organization Christiana
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
Thorton is the executive director they
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
have been pounding the pavement all over
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
the state at fairs and concerts and
 
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
schools trying to get the word out that
 
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
there's help for students that need that
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
help um but we we do also think that
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
impact hi hi commissioner how are you
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm great how are you uh better than
 
02:08:28.350 --> 02:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
average um the average is pretty low
 
02:08:30.990 --> 02:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
today so that's not really that great um
 
02:08:32.310 --> 02:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of questions I wanted to
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
ask you about um you talked about
 
02:08:36.669 --> 02:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
reducing staff and faculty and various
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
costs and whatnot um how so I friend of
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
mine who unfortunately died recently um
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
in his 80s but he taught at UNH for
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
about 40 years and he said to me once
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
the biggest difference between when he
 
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
started and I'm going to guess it was
 
02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:53.149 align:start position:0%
started and I'm going to guess it was
the

02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
60s um and today is that when he started
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
the Dean's office was a dean and a
 
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
secretary and that uh this about five or
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
six years ago he said and now it's like
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
104 people and I don't know what the
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
hell any of them do and uh his word's
 
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
not mine and uh there's a there's a
 
02:09:13.149 --> 02:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
sense in some places that
 
02:09:15.709 --> 02:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
occasionally in some academic
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
institutions probably less so in New
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there's a fewer people who are
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
do doing the the teaching bit and a lot
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
more people who are doing less of the
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
teaching piece do you have a sense of
 
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
that ratio and whether it's getting
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
better worse or
 
02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
indifferent uh thank you for the
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
question commissioner I don't have a
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
sense of the ratio I can get that
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
information for you I will make an
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
educated guess that certainly you said
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
40 years that over a 40-year time
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
frame um the ratio of administration to
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
to faculty has has increased I'll give
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
you a couple reasons for that the
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework that highered now
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
finds itself
 
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
in um requires compliance at
 
02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
Administration that maybe it did not
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
require 40 years ago um the the um
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
student Behavioral Health and student
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
needs and
 
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
supports um I believe are greater than
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
they were decades ago um so there there
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
are some reasons where why that ratio
 
02:10:28.910 --> 02:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
could have changed over the decades um I
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
can follow up get some information on
 
02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm more wondering L because the
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
60s was the 60s and I I was only alive
 
02:10:39.310 --> 02:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
for half of them and um the but do you
 
02:10:41.109 --> 02:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
think we're sort of crossing a line
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
where sort of we peaked on
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
administrative size and maybe are
 
02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:47.559 align:start position:0%
dipping a bit because I'm sure it's
 
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
worse than 63 but how about 23 I do
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner and and frankly we're we're
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
not g to have a choice it's not it's not
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
going to be a choice anymore you see the
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
trends when Revenue stays flat and costs
 
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
increase the math doesn't work so um we
 
02:11:09.069 --> 02:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
must reduce the cost structure and and
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
that's why we're looking at all
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
different ways to do that not just
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
employee comp right we have a footprint
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need to shrink if we have fewer
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
students so there there's a lot of work
 
02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:22.069 align:start position:0%
students so there there's a lot of work
at

02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
had well good um I think uh I was happy
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
when they picked you as Chancellor um
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
because I I think I said to you it's
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
about time but um I think you're suited
 
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
to that work um instate versus out of
 
02:11:37.069 --> 02:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
state I I I really enjoy the graph on
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
page five um it's like it was designed
 
02:11:43.629 --> 02:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
to answer a question I had um but uh
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's different probably at Keen Plymouth
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
and UNH they're three different ratios
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
are we at the point now where UNH is
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
actually more out of state in
 
02:11:56.030 --> 02:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
streate um I think we're about
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
5050 commissioner I wouldn't testify to
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
this in court as I'm sitting right here
 
02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
right now that's good I don't think it
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
might be like 53 to 40 I mean it's
 
02:12:07.950 --> 02:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
pretty close to
 
02:12:10.750 --> 02:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
5050 um it it might be a little higher
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
on on the non-resident I would make a
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
point though that um non-resident
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
students are not a bad thing
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
um we're the young we're the largest in
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
migrator of young talent in the state
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
and we have institutions that are larger
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
than than our student population would
 
02:12:38.109 --> 02:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
support and those non-resident students
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
bring economic activity to the state
 
02:12:43.510 --> 02:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
they stay and work here their families
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
come here um I understand that the the
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
and believe that the state investment
 
02:12:51.629 --> 02:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
should benefit our new Hampshire
 
02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
students but non-resident students bring
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
benefit to to our state in my opinion is
 
02:13:00.430 --> 02:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
it reasonable to say that to at least to
 
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
a small extent the out ofers are
 
02:13:06.229 --> 02:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
subsidizing instate
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
tuition they are okay not not by a wide
 
02:13:12.669 --> 02:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
margin but they are because if we look
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
at the state investment plus the net
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
tuition we receive from our New
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students it's slightly less
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
than the net tuition we receive from our
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
out of state students so there is some
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
subsidy would you know ballpark what
 
02:13:31.229 --> 02:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
tuition and fees are sticker price and
 
02:13:36.189 --> 02:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
discount on average oh yes um tuition
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
and fees net right
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
now $9,200 for
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
instate how about out
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I need to get you that commissioner
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
okay I have sticker price but I don't
 
02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:52.599 align:start position:0%
have the discount all right what sticker
 
02:13:52.599 --> 02:13:54.310 align:start position:0%
have the discount all right what sticker
for

02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
both I knew you were going to ask this
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I printed it before I came for every
 
02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
in hang on just a second if I may while
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
she's looking that up uh I do serve as
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate president's appointment
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
appointe to University system board and
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
if you took out out of state students
 
02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
right now with the infrastructure we
 
02:14:19.629 --> 02:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
have and have to support you would
 
02:14:22.109 --> 02:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
devastate the University system it would
 
02:14:25.870 --> 02:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
go out of existence that quick well I I
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
hope I'm not implying that I don't like
 
02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
out ofate students not at all okay
 
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.350 align:start position:0%
out ofate students not at all okay
sticker

02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
sticker
 
02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:34.069 align:start position:0%
sticker
price

02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
price
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
UNH tuition instate
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
155 out of state 30 I'm rounding
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
362 and that's just tuition just tuition
 
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.510 --> 02:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
both okay
 
02:15:01.549 --> 02:15:01.559 align:start position:0%
cool and we discount when I say
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
discount financial aid on average we
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
45% so on average right an instate
 
02:15:16.549 --> 02:15:16.559 align:start position:0%
student across University system is
 
02:15:16.559 --> 02:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
student across University system is
paying

02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
$9,200 for tuition and fees after
 
02:15:21.679 --> 02:15:23.510 align:start position:0%
$9,200 for tuition and fees after
financial

02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
financial
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
aid okay thank
 
02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%

Gary thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
speak with you but let me start by just
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
saying thank you as Chancellor
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
preventure pointed out we know this is a
 
02:16:22.830 --> 02:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
challenging bium that we're approaching
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
and frankly I'm grateful for the budget
 
02:16:28.910 --> 02:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
that has been provided to us as a
 
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
starting point for this
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
conversation uh with apologies it won't
 
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
prevent me from asking for opportunity
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
to see the state make additional
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
Investments that I think are in the best
 
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
interest of the work that we do for
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
students in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh I will take you through this slide
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
deck as efficiently as I can please you
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
feel free to stop me at any point that
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
it's helpful U cons referring back to
 
02:16:56.830 --> 02:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that folks were
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
asking in the session with chancell
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
preven you'll note that we start 93% of
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
the students that we serve are New
 
02:17:05.389 --> 02:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents and for those of you
 
02:17:07.389 --> 02:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
who are familiar with the Upper Valley
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast the North country you know
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
that the boundaries are a little bit
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
permeable in terms of Workforce and
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
students flowing back and forth so not
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
going to claim 100% New Hampshire but
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
that 93 is a probably a little bit of an
 
02:17:23.469 --> 02:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
understatement for the impact that we
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
have in the regions that border New
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campuses throughout the state
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
our work is embedded locally in large
 
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
part because the students we serve need
 
02:17:35.549 --> 02:17:35.559 align:start position:0%
that although about 30% of our
 
02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
instruction is occurring online these
 
02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
days majority of our students are
 
02:17:42.030 --> 02:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
working adults and the ability for them
 
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
to participate as part-time students
 
02:17:46.709 --> 02:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
primarily in courses that are accessible
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
to them where they live where they work
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
is essential it's part of what what
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
makes the community college system work
 
02:17:57.309 --> 02:17:57.319 align:start position:0%
about 24,000 students served last year
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
notably about 10,000 of those are
 
02:18:00.990 --> 02:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
students who are in high school
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
participating in Early College in
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes participating through their
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
high schools in some cases online and
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
other cases physically on our campuses
 
02:18:12.030 --> 02:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll come back to Early College a
 
02:18:14.150 --> 02:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:18:17.469 --> 02:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
later slide three just drawing attention
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
to the fact that that we see our role as
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
a resource for the state as a partner uh
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
paying attention to what Bea Department
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
of Labor New Hampshire employment
 
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
security identify as needs of the state
 
02:18:32.910 --> 02:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
as Chancellor preventure remarked at the
 
02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of her presentation uh you'll
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
see the community college system
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
referenced in the recently report
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
released report regarding Advanced
 
02:18:45.150 --> 02:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and the opportunity for uh
 
02:18:49.469 --> 02:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
that as a critical sector in the state's
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
future our
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
Mission access affordability high
 
02:18:57.790 --> 02:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
quality uh Partnerships with businesses
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
and communities throughout New Hampshire
 
02:19:01.709 --> 02:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
ensuring the success of our students
 
02:19:03.709 --> 02:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
with a skilled Workforce that's critical
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
economy I'm going to move past a couple
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
of the uh slides that are primarily just
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh background material Ju Just to remind
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
you the students we serve that that
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
issue of partnership with employers I'll
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
come back to momentarily but uh would
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
like to uh speak specifically to our
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
budget priorities on slide
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
eight controlling the cost of Education
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
affordability is a critical piece of
 
02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
access for the students we serve and
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
previous discussion with Chancellor
 
02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
proventure a lot of discussion about
 
02:19:46.629 --> 02:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
financial aid the Fiasco debacco
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
whatever the word of the day is for what
 
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
happened with the roll out of the new
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
FAFSA disastrous for a lot of students
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
and Families Our effort is to try and
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
protect students interest better by
 
02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
helping to manage costs at the front end
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that and I I'll come back to that in
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
our early college discussion but I also
 
02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge the fact that the
 
02:20:09.670 --> 02:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
state has been an absolutely critical
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
partner we've Frozen tuition for six
 
02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
years but we've kept it virtually flat
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
$5 increase since 2011 primarily through
 
02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
the partnership the support the state
 
02:20:23.309 --> 02:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
has provided but also
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
through essential financial management
 
02:20:28.990 --> 02:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
happening at each of our campuses and in
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
the system office I I'll probably be
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
redundant something I referenced later
 
02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
over the past 10 years we have reduced
 
02:20:40.590 --> 02:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
our Workforce by about 30% some of that
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the downturn
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
enrollment but part of it is becoming
 
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
more efficient as an organization our
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs in fiscal 14 were about
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
95 million $94 million actually uh this
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
past year about $76 million obviously
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the same inflationary
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
pressures we also want to Value the
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
workforce that contributes to the
 
02:21:04.990 --> 02:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
success of our students and to the
 
02:21:08.590 --> 02:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
viability of of our programs so have
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
been good stewards of State resources
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
and student resources as well as
 
02:21:16.190 --> 02:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
philanthropic support to assist in
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
managing cost at the front end
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with New Hampshire's
 
02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
employers later in this slide deck
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
you'll see a couple of of slides
 
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of employers with whom we work
 
02:21:30.349 --> 02:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's a list of current Partnerships
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
and engagement through our
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship New Hampshire program and
 
02:21:35.469 --> 02:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
through our business training centers
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
located on each of our campuses to work
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
with employers to address critical needs
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh in those communities some large some
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
small but all essential to the to the
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
and if I could take you to uh slide
 
02:22:03.640 --> 02:22:05.270 align:start position:0%
and if I could take you to uh slide

12
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh the house bill won the uh budget we
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
were presented over the summer
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
63,600 n, effectively flat which we
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
understand in this environment is
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
actually something for which we're
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
grateful we know that many agencies were
 
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
facing significant reductions in this
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
bium at the start and we appreciate the
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
the willingness to support the question
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
is posed does the efficiency budget fund
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
all current operations the the short
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
answer is no that it will require us to
 
02:22:38.830 --> 02:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
continue to manage expenses and figure
 
02:22:41.309 --> 02:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
out how to ensure that we can meet the
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
commitments we have to our faculty and
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
staff who support our students to
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
address the increases in health care and
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
on slide
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
13 a small number of critical priorities
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
areas that we hope the state will find
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
resources to continue to invest in the
 
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
number one priority that we're
 
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
identifying is duel and concurrent
 
02:23:10.990 --> 02:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment this is the 10,000 students
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
we served in high schools last year the
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
state for 3 Bia the last three Bia has
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
been making this investment beginning
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
first with a million dollars in the most
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
was Reason by at $2.5 million a year for
 
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
that $2.5 million a year in the past
 
02:23:29.309 --> 02:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
bium last year students earned
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
54,000 credits and our tuition fee rates
 
02:23:37.269 --> 02:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
that's about $13 million of value the
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
return on that investment to the state
 
02:23:42.269 --> 02:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
it shows up in the hands of students and
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
families throughout New Hampshire and if
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
we can continue to grow that we can
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
alleviate at least to some degree the
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
barriers of cost and the burden of debt
 
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
that becomes a problem for New Hampshire
 
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
families does not make them have to
 
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
worry as much about whether the FAFSA is
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
functioning the way it was intended to
 
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
less likely to to need loans long
 
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
term the additional opportunity with
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
duel and concurrent enrollment House
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 1530 passed two years ago is the
 
02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
pathway Bill Chancellor preventure
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
remarked on the fact that we have now
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
between the two system systems developed
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
about a 100 Pathways for students to go
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
through the Community College to the
 
02:24:25.359 --> 02:24:26.990 align:start position:0%
through the Community College to the
university

02:24:26.990 --> 02:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
university
 
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
system if we anchor those programs with
 
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
Early College while students are still
 
02:24:34.349 --> 02:24:34.359 align:start position:0%
in high school not only do we help
 
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
students manage the cost of high
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
education but the opportunity
 
02:24:40.349 --> 02:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
particularly knowing that New Hampshire
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
tends to export a lot of its high school
 
02:24:45.309 --> 02:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
graduates to out of state schools if we
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
can build relationships with those
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
students and those families while
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
they're still in high school increase
 
02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that more of those
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
students stay home here in New Hampshire
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
long-term benefit to the workforce of
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
the state long-term benefit to those
 
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
students and their families so that is
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
our first priority because we think it
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
has the greatest impact on
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
affordability the second opportunity has
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
to do with continuing to keep tuition
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
Frozen as I said the state has been an
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
incredible partner has allowed us to
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
keep tuition virtually flat since
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
2011 even with that we're still in the
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
top four in the country for the cost of
 
02:25:25.950 --> 02:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
Community College tuition we bump up
 
02:25:27.870 --> 02:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
against Maine on the east coast and
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
Maine keeps tuition incredibly
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
affordable but all three of the states
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
that we border have put significant
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
dollars into financial aid programs for
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
Community colleg is often free Community
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
College which creates some pressure
 
02:25:43.790 --> 02:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
again it's not necessarily drawing our
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
students away because most of our
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
students are location bound they're
 
02:25:49.550 --> 02:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
part-time students they're not going out
 
02:25:51.870 --> 02:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
of state to go to college but from an
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
employer perspective in figuring out
 
02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
State's Investments and the climate for
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development it's an
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to to maintain a
 
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage keep New Hampshire
 
02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh at the front of
 
02:26:07.950 --> 02:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
that Workforce credentials in the last
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
banum legislature made some Investments
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
allowing us to introduce short-term
 
02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
programs that were Workforce critical a
 
02:26:20.110 --> 02:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
lot of our campuses introduced LNA and
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
and Med licensed nursing assistant
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
medical assistant programs CDL training
 
02:26:29.110 --> 02:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
carpentry programs that would be in
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
critical need for Employers in the area
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
and for many of those programs what we
 
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
try to do is use that as seed money to
 
02:26:37.550 --> 02:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
make those programs self sustaining we
 
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
think there's an opportunity to continue
 
02:26:41.309 --> 02:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
to develop and iterate new programs that
 
02:26:44.269 --> 02:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
are in need for the State uh and and
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
finally on that you'll see math learning
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
communities my understanding I this
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
predates my time with the community
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
college system is that there was grant
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
funding for math learning communities
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
intended to strengthen the work of Math
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
teachers in high schools allowing them
 
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
to strengthen the success of students in
 
02:27:04.349 --> 02:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
high schools that has been brought back
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative lad was the champion of
 
02:27:09.790 --> 02:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
funding for that initiative we took some
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
time to find a a a lead for that program
 
02:27:15.389 --> 02:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
they launched at the end of this past
 
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
summer with 48 High School teachers will
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
continue to grow that program the person
 
02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
who's leading that efforts currently
 
02:27:25.269 --> 02:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
part-time uh the request for that
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
funding is to grow that to a full-time
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
role to expand the work that's being
 
02:27:31.389 --> 02:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
done for the math learning communities
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
in New
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on slide 14 um just a couple
 
02:27:39.469 --> 02:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
of highlights again enrollment has
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
stabilized about 2 and a half to 3%
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
increase last year summer and fall this
 
02:27:47.269 --> 02:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
year again about 3% a little too early
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
to save for spring this begins to see a
 
02:27:53.269 --> 02:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
turn in the what had been a long-term
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
Trend in declining enrollment for
 
02:27:57.469 --> 02:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
community colleges the rebound that
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
we're seeing we think has legs to it the
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
affordability the value proposition of
 
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
community colleges the ability to reach
 
02:28:07.389 --> 02:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
adult Learners in their communities but
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
also the ability to reach high school
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
students and increase their their
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
engagement we we see opportunity there
 
02:28:17.030 --> 02:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
we have done as I said earlier a good
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
deal of work to try and and bring that
 
02:28:23.710 --> 02:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment back but our our priority in
 
02:28:25.710 --> 02:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
all of this is to ensure the quality of
 
02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:27.230 align:start position:0%
all of this is to ensure the quality of
these

02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:28:30.269 --> 02:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
programs last year between our RN
 
02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
programs and our LPN programs about 300
 
02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
nurses prepared for New Hampshire New
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the sixth year in a row
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
the highest firsttime enlex pass rate
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
for nurses in the country that
 
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
commitment to Quality represented in all
 
02:28:49.269 --> 02:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
of our programs and as our portfolio of
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
programs increas inly concentrated in
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
technical programs healthcare related
 
02:28:56.670 --> 02:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
programs only becomes more important
 
02:28:58.950 --> 02:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
that we not allow the the the quality of
 
02:29:02.190 --> 02:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
those programs to suffer um budget
 
02:29:04.590 --> 02:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
management as I mentioned earlier 30%
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%

02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
managing the cost of of all of our
 
02:29:12.670 --> 02:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
operations currently looking at how
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're structured not necessarily
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
thinking about merger in the
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
conventional sense but really figuring
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
out where the offic icies are how do you
 
02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
distinguish between things that are
 
02:29:25.230 --> 02:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
critical in communities that are student
 
02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
facing and public serving in each region
 
02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
of the state and what kinds of things
 
02:29:31.710 --> 02:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
can we do more consistently make the
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities both more efficient to
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
operate but also more seamless for
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
students who may want to navigate across
 
02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:43.269 align:start position:0%
students who may want to navigate across
multiple

02:29:43.269 --> 02:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
campuses overview of of Revenue and
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then Final on slide 16 Ju Just to
 
02:29:58.870 --> 02:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge our board's responsibility
 
02:30:00.830 --> 02:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
as delegated by the legislature is to
 
02:30:02.830 --> 02:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
provide a well-coordinated system of
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
public community college education we
 
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
draw from trustees experience in
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
Industries and sectors across the state
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
as well as the public interest and we
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
believe that the board remains an
 
02:30:19.269 --> 02:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
excellent Steward on behalf of the state
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
for what we regard as a public resource
 
02:30:25.150 --> 02:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and I'll stop and see
 
02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
what questions I can
 
02:30:29.790 --> 02:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Chancellor uh quick
 
02:30:32.269 --> 02:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
question on on page 13 your additional
 
02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs were were they
 
02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
submitted as part of your
 
02:30:39.190 --> 02:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
budget they were not we followed the
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
direction that we had been given as with
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
Chancellor preventure we received clear
 
02:30:46.230 --> 02:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
indication to
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
submit uh
 
02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
without okay
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and I was wondering if you
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
could um talk a little bit because we we
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh Chancellor preventure just touched on
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
it the the governor's task force on
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
higher education uh
 
02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
specifically if the recommendations of
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
that task force are are are reacted uh
 
02:31:11.429 --> 02:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
how will that uh affect you
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
financially depends on which
 
02:31:15.550 --> 02:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations you might recall there
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
probably about 40 or so bullet points on
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
there uh the ones and and Chancellor
 
02:31:24.030 --> 02:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
prevention I have been submitting
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
reports for first a quarterly report
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
more recently a first annual report on
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
this there are a handful of priorities
 
02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
and among those uh Early College
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
investment we think is is potentially
 
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
valuable again to some degree it's not
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
financially beneficial to us as much as
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
it is to New Hampshire students and
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
families for the value that the state
 
02:31:47.469 --> 02:31:47.479 align:start position:0%
transfers into their hands and for the
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
education we're able to provide them um
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
some of the other proposed uh changes
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
have to do with uh technology we're
 
02:32:00.190 --> 02:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
looking at introducing uh a platform
 
02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
that will help students navigate the
 
02:32:03.790 --> 02:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
pathways that have been created make it
 
02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
more sensible for degree planning
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood that students
 
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
can use the information that's available
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
to them in ways that are constructive we
 
02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
think those things will be helpful to us
 
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of growing enrollment U and and
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
fulfilling our
 
02:32:21.630 --> 02:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
mission okay and my last question is on
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
actually on your curriculum and how you
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
deal with the business Community sorry
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
how you deal with the business Community
 
02:32:33.389 --> 02:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
um has your curriculum changed to meet
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
the needs of the business Community
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
which I think have changed pretty
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the last 10 years or
 
02:32:40.510 --> 02:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
so it it does virtually all of our
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
technical programs healthc care programs
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
have industry advisory boards working
 
02:32:47.630 --> 02:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
closely with business and industry to
 
02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're delivering what
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
they need for their Workforce our
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship New Hampshire hundreds of
 
02:32:56.910 --> 02:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships have been initiated over
 
02:33:00.030 --> 02:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
the last several years and many of those
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
are customized to the specific needs
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
that business and industry have that a
 
02:33:06.790 --> 02:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
particular employer or occupation
 
02:33:10.750 --> 02:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
requires supplemented with uh with
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate classroom
 
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
instruction but primarily focused on the
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
experiential components that that
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
employers value the hard skills that
 
02:33:24.349 --> 02:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
that they need um in some cases ba
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
systems an excellent illustration the
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
microelectronics boot camp that was
 
02:33:30.269 --> 02:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
developed in Partnership between BAE
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
Systems and Nashville Community College
 
02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
work that's being done at Manchester
 
02:33:36.750 --> 02:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
Community College for welding for
 
02:33:39.670 --> 02:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
Cadia again industry tells us what they
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
need we figure out with the good grace
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
of of talented faculty how to deliver
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
programs that align with those
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
needs uh thank you sorry I lied because
 
02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
I said I do have one more question uh
 
02:33:55.630 --> 02:33:55.640 align:start position:0%
what percentage of your students are New
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents are in state 93% is
 
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
our best uh figure it it varies a little
 
02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
bit and among campuses closer border
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
versus Central although again 93% is a
 
02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
safe number to work with okay and I'm
 
02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm guessing that uh those students
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
you may not have this data but those
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
students once they graduate they tend to
 
02:34:23.030 --> 02:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
stick home Dome we we we are we are work
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire employment security
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
to have stronger clear data on the
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
outcomes for our graduates but
 
02:34:31.630 --> 02:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
relatively confident that you will find
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
their here at home as I mentioned
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
earlier the majority of our students are
 
02:34:38.429 --> 02:34:38.439 align:start position:0%
working adults as an
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
illustration two two median age of our
 
02:34:47.269 --> 02:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh undergraduate population let let me
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
do this differently focus on the nursing
 
02:34:53.309 --> 02:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
students 2third of those are in that 25
 
02:34:55.429 --> 02:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
and older category one in five already
 
02:34:57.309 --> 02:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
has a bachelor's degree in some other
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
field before they enter our nursing
 
02:35:02.190 --> 02:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
program most of those folks are embedded
 
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
in the communities where they live
 
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
they're taking care of Children and
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
Families in those homes and they're not
 
02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:09.910 align:start position:0%
Families in those homes and they're not
going

02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere thank
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
youor uh I wanted to give you the
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about an event
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have on the 15th in your
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
relationship between the business
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
communities uh over at nhti well tra
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
trade po Mike R many of you will know
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
from his dirty job series is going to be
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
here governor elect aot I think is going
 
02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
to be uh with us for the festivities we
 
02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
expect probably 3, to 3500 people
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
joining us that day it's an opportunity
 
02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
to remind young people and slightly less
 
02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
young people what the opportunities are
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
what the needs are for occupations that
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
that often get overlooked and and are
 
02:35:58.830 --> 02:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
are are critical for for all of us so
 
02:36:02.269 --> 02:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a big event and and probably
 
02:36:04.309 --> 02:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
as Lively an opportunity to be on the
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
nhdi campus and although I'm told
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
tickets are sold out and not wanting to
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
Curry favor with legislators or staff
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
who support legislators I'm sure we
 
02:36:15.150 --> 02:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
could find a way in the back door if you
 
02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
could find a way in the back door if you
need

02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:20.230 --> 02:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
02:36:22.349 --> 02:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
well one thing I think is worthy of
 
02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
observing and I hope it's still the case
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
I've been a few times visiting the
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
campuses and I was impressed with the
 
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
fact that they get truckloads of brand
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
new vehicles contributed so that the
 
02:36:35.550 --> 02:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
students are being trained on the latest
 
02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
Vehicles the same thing with outboard
 
02:36:41.070 --> 02:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
motors and printing presses those still
 
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
relationships still ongoing I'm very
 
02:36:46.110 --> 02:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
impressed with that as a lasting Legacy
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
of Paul
 
02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
Holloway and and the friendship that he
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
and Anna Grace have had with the
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
02:36:55.110 --> 02:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
auto deals Association is an
 
02:36:57.710 --> 02:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
extraordinary partner continues to
 
02:37:00.950 --> 02:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
provide Vehicles in-kind support for
 
02:37:03.790 --> 02:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
equipment and about $100,000 a year in
 
02:37:05.349 --> 02:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
scholarships for students who are
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
participating in automotive technology
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
programs as we continue to develop um
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
our U EV programs in parallel with our
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
traditional uh Automotive programs we
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
continue to work closely with NADA and
 
02:37:23.790 --> 02:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it's a great illustration of
 
02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
what business in postsecondary education
 
02:37:31.469 --> 02:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.710 --> 02:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
like um I oh I'm not supposed to move
 
02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
this close to me I'm too loud apparently
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
um what's your tuition roughly it's
 
02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
$215 a credit and a $25 credit
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment fee and what's that how did
 
02:37:51.309 --> 02:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
if I were to annualize that what that
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
$7,200 gives me an opportunity to
 
02:37:55.950 --> 02:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
highlight that one of the benefits of
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
the state's longstanding commitment is
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
that by keeping tuition effectively flat
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
since 2011 in 20 in in 2012 2013 the
 
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
value of Federal pel grant was about
 
02:38:12.150 --> 02:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
$4,600 which meant that a full-time
 
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
student at any of our campuses would
 
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
still need to find over
 
02:38:18.710 --> 02:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
$2,000 over time as the value of that
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
pel Grant has now Eclipse tuition
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
$739 through that partnership a student
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
who's pel eligible I is is covered fully
 
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
by federal funds now majority of our
 
02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
students are part-time so the example is
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
not a perfect one and and for many of
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
our students who are not pel eligible
 
02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's still out of pocket that they're
 
02:38:42.389 --> 02:38:42.399 align:start position:0%
paying so it's the reason we maintain
 
02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
our interest in affordability can you be
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
pel eligible and go part-time you can
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
but only to to Half Time
 
02:38:54.429 --> 02:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
oh okay I'm below a certain threshold
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
the enrollment isn't there and and I
 
02:38:58.750 --> 02:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
should note that again this is for
 
02:38:58.760 --> 02:39:00.070 align:start position:0%
should note that again this is for
credit-based

02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
credit-based
 
02:39:03.550 --> 02:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
programs increasingly we see our work in
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce focused programs that are
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
often not eligible for p uh
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
participation it's one of the places
 
02:39:13.309 --> 02:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
where Congress has stumbled for years to
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
overcome that barrier of how students
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
really need to learn and what the
 
02:39:20.830 --> 02:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
workforce really needs versus how
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
federal aid is handled I will say that
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
we've benefited from weoa the workforce
 
02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
Innovation Opportunity Act funding and
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
partnership with folks like Joe Doran
 
02:39:34.389 --> 02:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
director doran's been a helpful partner
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
in supporting students in many of our
 
02:39:38.349 --> 02:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
programs for which we owe a funding is
 
02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
the is the better option maybe you can
 
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
talk to your friend Mike Ro to call
 
02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
Congress and see if he can do something
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
about that um you and I talked in the
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
past about um you have dorms at nhti and
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have less and less need for dorm
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
students at nhti have you done any more
 
02:40:00.110 --> 02:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
looking I was driving by the other day
 
02:40:01.309 --> 02:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking you know there's that
 
02:40:03.309 --> 02:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
road that sort of dead ends in the
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
circle yep and I was thinking it'd be a
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
great spot for housing so e even e even
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
today we have 3,000 students enrolled at
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
nhti we have about 300 beds in the three
 
02:40:20.269 --> 02:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
residential buildings buildings one of
 
02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
those buildings is actually leased to um
 
02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire hockey Academy it's a
 
02:40:30.269 --> 02:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
partnership that they have with a local
 
02:40:32.309 --> 02:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
high school for students who aspire to
 
02:40:34.150 --> 02:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
continue their secondary school
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
education while polishing their their
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
hockey skills perhaps for future uh
 
02:40:42.030 --> 02:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
college scholarship opportunities or
 
02:40:45.110 --> 02:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
Beyond so we've made good use of one of
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
those three buildings that that had
 
02:40:49.950 --> 02:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
capacity and will continue to try and
 
02:40:52.309 --> 02:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
figure out what's the best use of
 
02:40:58.830 --> 02:40:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
welcome uh thanks Chancellor U I was
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
actually happy to introduce that bill a
 
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
while ago but they still haven't passed
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
it but they should um I have a quick
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
question about the Dual and concurrent
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment as you've looked at the the
 
02:41:14.830 --> 02:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the stabilizing of your
 
02:41:17.550 --> 02:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
student body and then the light uptick
 
02:41:19.950 --> 02:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
how important has that if you have like
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
if I'm in high school and I receive for
 
02:41:24.190 --> 02:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
example credit hours are you seeing
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
those students transition to the
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
community college and continue on I'm
 
02:41:30.269 --> 02:41:30.279 align:start position:0%
just curious if you have data on that so
 
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
yes and no so
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh we looked at 2016 to 2022 students
 
02:41:40.349 --> 02:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
who participated in our Early College
 
02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
Programs to have some sense of what the
 
02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
flowthrough looked like and of about
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
35,000 students served over that period
 
02:41:49.870 --> 02:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
of time almost 28,000 went to
 
02:41:52.670 --> 02:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education now of that
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
group about 6,000 came to the community
 
02:41:58.830 --> 02:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
college system about 6,600 ended up at
 
02:42:01.469 --> 02:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
the University system the majority of
 
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
these students ended up at four-year
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
institutions and the majority of those
 
02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
students at for year institutions
 
02:42:10.510 --> 02:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
actually went out of state so that's why
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
I said if we can tie this to House Bill
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
1530 to help introduce students not only
 
02:42:17.990 --> 02:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
to the academic Pathways but introduce
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
them to our faculty to our facilities I
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
think we can encourage more New
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students and their families to
 
02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
look seriously at staying in New
 
02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to complete the degrees that
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
are now made more seamless more
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
affordable and and more clearly
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
available to them what we expect to see
 
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
over time is that if we can reach more
 
02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
students for whom college is an
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
aspiration but not a certainty that we
 
02:42:46.070 --> 02:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
can have more students who will come to
 
02:42:47.910 --> 02:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
the community college system but our
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
experience is the majority of students
 
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
participating in Early College these are
 
02:42:54.670 --> 02:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
honors level courses it's either AP or
 
02:42:56.190 --> 02:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
it's honors or they're taking these
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
early college courses these are students
 
02:42:59.309 --> 02:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
who already know they're going to
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
college that's the aspiration and we
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
think that if we could make this more
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
accessible to that next group of
 
02:43:07.469 --> 02:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
students for whom college is less
 
02:43:09.389 --> 02:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
certain and for whom affordability is a
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
greater concern we think we would see
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
more of these students actually take
 
02:43:15.110 --> 02:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of the opportunities to come
 
02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
to the community college system and not
 
02:43:20.950 --> 02:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
not everybody necess necessarily needs
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
College in the way we traditionally
 
02:43:25.070 --> 02:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
think of a four-year degree or Beyond
 
02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
but the building blocks of most of our
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
programs whether it ties into the
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
related instruction to support an
 
02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship whether it's somebody
 
02:43:35.469 --> 02:43:35.479 align:start position:0%
who's heading into one of the trades but
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
gets that foundational set of credits
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
and skills that are in the bank for them
 
02:43:42.110 --> 02:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
both literally and figuratively for
 
02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
somebody who's thinking about going into
 
02:43:45.389 --> 02:43:45.399 align:start position:0%
the military but doesn't want to feel
 
02:43:47.550 --> 02:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
like they're losing ground with peers
 
02:43:49.870 --> 02:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
who are going directly to college we can
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
give students in all of those Avenues a
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
foundation of SEC postsecondary learning
 
02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
that that's money in the bank it's a
 
02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
foundation of academic success that they
 
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
can build on regardless of which
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
direction they choose to take it thank
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:12.510 --> 02:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
much like to invite up now the New
 
02:44:18.030 --> 02:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon members of
 
02:45:05.469 --> 02:45:05.479 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm Charlie McIntyre I have the
 
02:45:08.750 --> 02:45:08.760 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Lottery and with me is our CFO
Jim

02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
Jim
 
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
dur um I only have one
 
02:45:18.070 --> 02:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
slide and it's the last 10 years of
 
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
revenues transfers and
 
02:45:25.710 --> 02:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
expenses and you'll note from fy15 to
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
fy4 that the expenses of the lottery
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
have gone up
 
02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
66% and at the same time the
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
profitability of the lottery has gone up
 
02:45:37.469 --> 02:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
three-fold uh whenever in private sector
 
02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
you get to do 66% expense growth and
 
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
three times Revenue growth that's called
 
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
better than good um regrettably it has
 
02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
not been reflected on our salaries we
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
hope that to change in the near
 
02:45:54.110 --> 02:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
future um but obviously we're a
 
02:45:55.830 --> 02:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency we've had 10-year
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
growth our growth is not only remarkable
 
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
in the sense
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
of its size but by comparison other
 
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
lotteries uh we're the fastest growing
 
02:46:05.550 --> 02:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
lottery in North
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
America um and not only that growth has
 
02:46:11.070 --> 02:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
obviously helped the state with funding
 
02:46:13.469 --> 02:46:13.479 align:start position:0%
but also the retail Network our
 
02:46:15.870 --> 02:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
commission retail network has more than
 
02:46:17.990 --> 02:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
doubled its commission rates in similar
 
02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
time not only does it help them in terms
 
02:46:21.790 --> 02:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
of money to the stores but also every
 
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
dollar of lottery sales at a store is
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
accompanied by $3 of sales of something
 
02:46:30.190 --> 02:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
else candy bar soda gas Etc
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
um notably we are either at or near the
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
top of every single metric that is
 
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
measured in our business and that means
 
02:46:39.070 --> 02:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
every product every sale every
 
02:46:41.389 --> 02:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
profitability efficiencies and the rest
 
02:46:44.830 --> 02:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
and so um while our budget is um
 
02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
significant it is essentially
 
02:46:47.590 --> 02:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
self-funded there's no money the state
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
sends us we spend Revenue stream and
 
02:46:53.630 --> 02:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
send you their profitability so um I
 
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
expect to give you guys some time back I
 
02:46:56.670 --> 02:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't expect to take all 20 minutes but
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer any questions
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
you have regarding our budget sure thank
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
you very much um more of a of a comment
 
02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
that on the sin taxes that the state
 
02:47:08.910 --> 02:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
collects whether drinking smoking and
 
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
gambling uh we've seen uh drinking go
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
down smoking go way down but but
 
02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
gambling is thriving um and the the
 
02:47:21.910 --> 02:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
state is the benefactor of that one of
 
02:47:23.790 --> 02:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh my question two years ago when we
 
02:47:25.790 --> 02:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
were discussing it Massachusetts was
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
about to introduce sports sports game
 
02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling and uh they have since
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
done that uh we were concerned I think
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
rightly so that it would impact our
 
02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
Sports gambling apparatus how is that
 
02:47:40.510 --> 02:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
materialized and and what's been the
 
02:47:42.309 --> 02:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
impact of of not only competition for
 
02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but other states across
 
02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
the na as well it's a good question
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
certainly when I hear frequently I think
 
02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's about a 15% drop in Revenue uh I
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
can't assess the other side I can only
 
02:47:56.269 --> 02:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
tell you that the most popular places in
 
02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
the state for a while to bet on Sports
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
were the Portsmith traffic circle and
 
02:48:02.590 --> 02:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
the Mall of New Hampshire so folks were
 
02:48:04.349 --> 02:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
coming up betting on sports going to the
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
liquor store and then going to shop
 
02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
taxfree I don't know if what impact it's
 
02:48:11.469 --> 02:48:11.479 align:start position:0%
had on that the retail side but for us
 
02:48:14.950 --> 02:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
about a 15% drop um the last full year
 
02:48:17.150 --> 02:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
we had Mass players kept driving up here
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
it was about $38 million of profit
 
02:48:21.070 --> 02:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
ability I think last year sports betting
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
was like 32 32 million so not you know
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
15 16% okay is football still the
 
02:48:31.230 --> 02:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
driver football and the basketball
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
tournament the NCA tournament okay uh
 
02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
and we lost more re we lost more sports
 
02:48:39.150 --> 02:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
book physical Sports Book Sales we had a
 
02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
number of large betters who drove up
 
02:48:44.269 --> 02:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts to play at the brook
 
02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
um and C Brook and um Manchester they
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
sto coming up and they're going out of
 
02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
Boston but they were frankly more
 
02:48:54.269 --> 02:48:54.279 align:start position:0%
talented at it so our margin wasn't very
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
good so we we lost customers but we lost
 
02:48:59.230 --> 02:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
ones we didn't want anyway and finally
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
does is sports betting especially
 
02:49:02.550 --> 02:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
football betting in the state of New
 
02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that dependent on how well
 
02:49:08.269 --> 02:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
the Patriots do like is there more
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
interest in betting on sports if if the
 
02:49:12.269 --> 02:49:12.279 align:start position:0%
if the team is is good or better like
 
02:49:13.950 --> 02:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
the The Fringe better there there is
 
02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
more interest certainly but sometime
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's a detriment like we had a
 
02:49:19.229 --> 02:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
really bad NBA season last year because
 
02:49:20.590 --> 02:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
the Celtics were really good and they
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
kept covering and so it was it was not
 
02:49:25.229 --> 02:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
helpful but it's helpful when the team
 
02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
is good it's we always want the local
 
02:49:29.710 --> 02:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
team to win but not cover it's it makes
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
being a fan
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
you I like that um I have a couple of
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions um your in terms of
 
02:49:44.229 --> 02:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
profitability um scratch
 
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
tickets most profitable thing we have
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
largest yes in in terms of total
 
02:49:53.870 --> 02:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
toal profit total uh I think it was 68
 
02:49:55.670 --> 02:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
just based on scratch tickets yeah right
 
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
in there 68 million so with um the
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
margin on a scratch ticket is around 18
 
02:50:02.469 --> 02:50:02.479 align:start position:0%
half percent margin and so theoretically
 
02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
in out of your 200ish scratch tickets
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
are about
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
68 68% payout you mean no$ 68 million
 
02:50:14.910 --> 02:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
yeah a profitability yes and then what's
 
02:50:17.110 --> 02:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
second uh second would be the joint
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
Powerball megail Millions type product
 
02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
game last year we did N I think it was
 
02:50:25.309 --> 02:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
91 million in the sales that's a 40%
 
02:50:27.870 --> 02:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
margin so that's about 36 37 million
 
02:50:30.389 --> 02:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
profitability for that um then would be
 
02:50:34.349 --> 02:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
sports betting at 32 um our ey Lottery
 
02:50:37.469 --> 02:50:37.479 align:start position:0%
platform is right there about 30 and
 
02:50:39.150 --> 02:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
then everything falls off of those those
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
are what we call tent
 
02:50:45.790 --> 02:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
poles oh tent poles okay um you're so
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
this year I mean you're you know step
 
02:50:52.550 --> 02:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
step step up hockey stick you call it um
 
02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
this year you're down a few million
 
02:50:56.830 --> 02:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
through four months yeah so um over
 
02:50:59.630 --> 02:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
prior year over no over prior yeah not
 
02:51:01.309 --> 02:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
not as against plan but a prior year
 
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
well no but the plan was just a really
 
02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:04.469 align:start position:0%
well no but the plan was just a really
bad

02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
bad
 
02:51:06.830 --> 02:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
estimate no what I meant is you're doing
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
really well correct what it is is last
 
02:51:12.910 --> 02:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
year we started the year with two very
 
02:51:14.590 --> 02:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
very large jackpots over a billion
 
02:51:16.870 --> 02:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and we haven't had those this
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
year and it makes my job really easy if
 
02:51:22.110 --> 02:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
in August we have multiple jackpots but
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
if we don't have them for a while I have
 
02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
to pray to the jackpot Gods uh and so
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
that's that drives that much business oh
 
02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah oh sure there are times we will do
 
02:51:33.309 --> 02:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
in Powerball sales we'll
 
02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
do more than half our business in 13
 
02:51:39.429 --> 02:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
days for a year and so it's this the
 
02:51:40.750 --> 02:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
we'll do millions and millions and
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
millions in a day and sales it it
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
matters the frenzy once it hits the
 
02:51:47.790 --> 02:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
media once there's water cooler talk
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
once you drive by the billboard and it
 
02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
says billions yeah it's very much um
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
like a three foot snowstorm shows up
 
02:51:56.590 --> 02:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
when it shows up so the next time I see
 
02:51:58.110 --> 02:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
a billboard that says a billion I should
 
02:52:00.229 --> 02:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
change the state revenue estimates
 
02:52:03.309 --> 02:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
ballpark no not necessarily and also one
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
the one of the interesting Parts is is
 
02:52:07.710 --> 02:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
that um the jackpots are a factor of the
 
02:52:09.750 --> 02:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
bond factor and so our cash on hand is
 
02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
multiplied by a bond factor which is
 
02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
affected by interest rates so as
 
02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
interest rates Rose our jackpots got
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
higher even though the cash value was
 
02:52:20.590 --> 02:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:20.600 --> 02:52:23.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:52:23.550 --> 02:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:27.429 --> 02:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative congratulations keep
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
up to good work thank you thank you
 
02:52:32.309 --> 02:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative see no more questions
 
02:52:39.269 --> 02:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:43.309 --> 02:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
you and now I like to uh bring up the
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:52.990 --> 02:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon commissioner good
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record and I just want
 
02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
to thank you for putting Charlie ahead
 
02:52:58.790 --> 02:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
of me um and I can confirm based on his
 
02:53:02.150 --> 02:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that our budget will be okay
 
02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh given how he's done and I will also
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
mention Charle that um I'm one of those
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
when I see the B number in front of the
 
02:53:11.150 --> 02:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
the Powerball I buy a ticket so I'm one
 
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
of those uh people jumping in there um
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
so appreciate the opportunity to present
 
02:53:18.750 --> 02:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
this to you uh you know our vision a
 
02:53:21.229 --> 02:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
mission for uh the Department of
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
Education is to live free and learn um
 
02:53:27.269 --> 02:53:27.279 align:start position:0%
with a very student centered approach to
 
02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
create Bright Futures for all students
 
02:53:32.590 --> 02:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
um our objective here is interesting as
 
02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
well that I got to follow usnh as well
 
02:53:37.349 --> 02:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
as uh the community college system uh
 
02:53:39.550 --> 02:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
because we are basically connecting up
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
those systems we are preparing students
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh that can hopefully uh some of which
 
02:53:46.910 --> 02:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
anyways will have a successful
 
02:53:49.950 --> 02:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career and at either UNH
 
02:53:52.229 --> 02:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh Plymouth State Keen State College or
 
02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
one of our community college systems
 
02:53:56.550 --> 02:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
across or schools across the state um
 
02:53:58.990 --> 02:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
it's interesting as well as those indivi
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
those systems are trying to figure out
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
what the future looks like I can confirm
 
02:54:05.670 --> 02:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
for you today that the class of
 
02:54:08.110 --> 02:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
2036 which will be eligible to go to
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
postsecondary started school in
 
02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
September so we pretty much know plus or
 
02:54:13.630 --> 02:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
minus a very small percentage of how
 
02:54:15.190 --> 02:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
many of those students we have in the
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
system that will be um matriculating
 
02:54:19.469 --> 02:54:19.479 align:start position:0%
into one of our universities system you
 
02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
know schools um the budget submission
 
02:54:24.269 --> 02:54:24.279 align:start position:0%
that you have before you uh meets the
 
02:54:26.110 --> 02:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
governor's parameters that he gave us
 
02:54:28.990 --> 02:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
which was about a 3.3% reduction uh
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
versus the 25 adjusted authorization
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
that we were given um those of you who
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
have seen our budget presentations
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
before are familiar probably with our
 
02:54:40.070 --> 02:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
page one um I realize that the numbers
 
02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
are small I could make them smaller and
 
02:54:44.590 --> 02:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
add more years but um I try not to do
 
02:54:46.910 --> 02:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
that to your eyes but we have laid out
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
for you kind of in one
 
02:54:52.269 --> 02:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
piece of paper you got a snapshot of how
 
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
where the money comes in and where the
 
02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
money goes out um you will see at the
 
02:54:58.510 --> 02:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
top we have Revenue our funding comes
 
02:55:00.429 --> 02:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
from General funds federal funds
 
02:55:02.750 --> 02:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund inter agency
 
02:55:04.990 --> 02:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
transfers and then some other funds that
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
we receive through fees or other revenue
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
streams uh we have also put on there the
 
02:55:12.830 --> 02:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
local education Ed spending that takes
 
02:55:15.630 --> 02:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
place um you know in the state of New
 
02:55:17.990 --> 02:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have the state contribution
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
um and then we have a local contribution
 
02:55:21.510 --> 02:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
through our local property taxes and so
 
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
you can see the amount of local property
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
taxes or contributed to the K12 system
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
um over the previous years uh We've also
 
02:55:33.550 --> 02:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
included um District enrollment for the
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
adma um as well as average cost per
 
02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
pupil uh we then summarize on this slide
 
02:55:41.910 --> 02:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
our general funds um which is basically
 
02:55:44.630 --> 02:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
general fund state aid which is uh
 
02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
programs that the legislature has given
 
02:55:49.110 --> 02:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
to the department uh for specific
 
02:55:51.870 --> 02:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
targeted programs such as historically
 
02:55:53.710 --> 02:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
they were uh things like Dropout
 
02:55:55.429 --> 02:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
prevention or Statewide special
 
02:55:57.670 --> 02:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
education Career Tech student orgs
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
building Aid lease uh lease Aid um I
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
will point out that there were you'll
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
you'll notice some of these line items
 
02:56:07.630 --> 02:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
um have moved in previous
 
02:56:09.910 --> 02:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislatures uh there were funds that
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
were previously either in general fund
 
02:56:13.030 --> 02:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
state aid or in general funds passed
 
02:56:14.269 --> 02:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
through that have been moved down into
 
02:56:17.349 --> 02:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um and so
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to see
 
02:56:21.190 --> 02:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
that for the next bium those general
 
02:56:23.309 --> 02:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
fund State a programs either have been
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
phased out or they have been been moved
 
02:56:28.670 --> 02:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
down to the um uh the education trust
 
02:56:31.469 --> 02:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
fund and out of general fund state aid
 
02:56:33.790 --> 02:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
it is building Aid lease has been moved
 
02:56:38.269 --> 02:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
down into uh the trust fund um when I go
 
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the next section general fund pass
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
through state aid these are funds that
 
02:56:43.469 --> 02:56:43.479 align:start position:0%
are provided to the department uh which
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
essentially we receive and then we push
 
02:56:48.910 --> 02:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
out to our schools or to other programs
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
um whether those are associated with
 
02:56:52.510 --> 02:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
court order placements which again is
 
02:56:55.150 --> 02:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
not showing um in the current proposal
 
02:56:56.670 --> 02:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
because it's been moved down into the
 
02:57:00.910 --> 02:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund um and then uh
 
02:57:02.429 --> 02:57:02.439 align:start position:0%
assessments as well has been moved down
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
into the education trust fund um the
 
02:57:06.469 --> 02:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
other thing that I want to point out
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
with respect to some of these general
 
02:57:10.229 --> 02:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
fund Amounts is as you get into the
 
02:57:12.269 --> 02:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
budget process and if you begin to
 
02:57:13.830 --> 02:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
Tinker with those we have to be a little
 
02:57:15.309 --> 02:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
bit sensitive because some of these
 
02:57:18.269 --> 02:57:18.279 align:start position:0%
include match funds uh which are requ IR
 
02:57:20.190 --> 02:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
ired in order to retain our federal
 
02:57:21.790 --> 02:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
grants so these are the state
 
02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
contribution the state match that allows
 
02:57:27.190 --> 02:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
us to uh continue to participate in the
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
federal uh the related Federal match uh
 
02:57:31.830 --> 02:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
you then have the general fund salary
 
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
and benefits so you can see the history
 
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
of salaries benefits and insurance and
 
02:57:38.309 --> 02:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
our allocations from our uh other
 
02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
organizations or other agencies in the
 
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
state and then you can see kind of a
 
02:57:44.429 --> 02:57:44.439 align:start position:0%
layout of uh where the funds and the
 
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund are going um and so
 
02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
that is kind of a big picture and I'm
 
02:57:50.429 --> 02:57:50.439 align:start position:0%
sure there's probably some questions
 
02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
about that but I'll move through the
 
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
presentation and then probably come back
 
02:57:55.469 --> 02:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
to that to deal with questions um I
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
added a slide to this bm's uh
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
presentation about enrollment on slide
 
02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
number two uh so that you had some
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
perspective um as to how enrollments are
 
02:58:09.269 --> 02:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
trending in the State uh not you know
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
dissimilar from the comments that you
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
heard from the University system uh
 
02:58:15.269 --> 02:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat from the community college
 
02:58:17.389 --> 02:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
system while there serving a an older
 
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
population General generally and are not
 
02:58:22.190 --> 02:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
as uh Sensi sensitive to direct student
 
02:58:24.630 --> 02:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know K12 student populations um you
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
know the number of students in the state
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh the demographic
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
shift continues and we expect um you
 
02:58:32.590 --> 02:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
know out into the you know and I don't
 
02:58:34.389 --> 02:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
want to go you know too far out but out
 
02:58:36.030 --> 02:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
into the foreseeable future we believe
 
02:58:37.349 --> 02:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
that the number of students in the state
 
02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire will continue to
 
02:58:41.030 --> 02:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
decline and so we will continue we have
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
been for several decades now but we will
 
02:58:46.750 --> 02:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
continue to um respond to those declines
 
02:58:50.670 --> 02:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
in the delivery system on the next slide
 
02:58:54.030 --> 02:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
titled FY 2425 hb2 Appropriations I just
 
02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to flag for the committee uh some
 
02:59:01.389 --> 02:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
of the 2023 or the 23 surplus funds that
 
02:59:02.990 --> 02:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
were given to the department for
 
02:59:05.070 --> 02:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
specific projects uh there was a
 
02:59:09.150 --> 02:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
legislative process or project to um get
 
02:59:11.150 --> 02:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
a hold of a license for the student
 
02:59:13.790 --> 02:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
Clearing House data software so that we
 
02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
are then able to uh run information and
 
02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
provide to our
 
02:59:22.309 --> 02:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh secondary schools the the direction
 
02:59:24.070 --> 02:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
those students and if they go into a
 
02:59:26.349 --> 02:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institution Vis title two
 
02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
reporting to be able to uh track them
 
02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
and see where they are so we're
 
02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
providing that information we're able to
 
02:59:34.269 --> 02:59:34.279 align:start position:0%
provide that information back to um the
 
02:59:36.910 --> 02:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
secondary schools uh we received a
 
02:59:39.710 --> 02:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
one-time allocation of $900,000 which
 
02:59:43.229 --> 02:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
was uh directed at our Bureau of student
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
wellness um we received a Civics fund
 
02:59:48.190 --> 02:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
education which is related to developing
 
02:59:52.590 --> 02:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum for the um uh for civics K12
 
02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um those
 
02:59:57.229 --> 02:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
funds have been committed and are we're
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
actively working on the development of
 
03:00:01.389 --> 03:00:01.399 align:start position:0%
that curriculum and that's moving along
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
um we have received a $4 million grant
 
03:00:07.710 --> 03:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
for uh and the the idea of trying to
 
03:00:09.870 --> 03:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
expand the number of computer science
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
credentials in the state we've
 
03:00:14.190 --> 03:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
implemented that program um the reality
 
03:00:16.670 --> 03:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
is that there has not been a substantive
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
uptake of that program the name of
 
03:00:20.229 --> 03:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
program is called upgrade um had a call
 
03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
on it today but there's not been tons of
 
03:00:24.070 --> 03:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
folks who have been coming out of the
 
03:00:26.830 --> 03:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
woodwork who are in Industry seeking to
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
convert into the education profession um
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
in spite of uh you know quite a
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
significant Outreach effort um to a diff
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
a bunch of different um constituents um
 
03:00:39.550 --> 03:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
we will in this budget in hb2 be seeking
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
language to use un uh committed amounts
 
03:00:46.229 --> 03:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
of those funds this is non-aps funds we
 
03:00:48.750 --> 03:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
have in there um for our program to
 
03:00:50.830 --> 03:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
expand our dual and concurrent beyond
 
03:00:52.750 --> 03:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
the community college system into the
 
03:00:54.510 --> 03:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
university system so that students in
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
high school will be able to earn um
 
03:01:00.150 --> 03:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire credits uh
 
03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know while they're in high school so
 
03:01:04.389 --> 03:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
really we do that already for the um you
 
03:01:06.429 --> 03:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
know the Community College um and you
 
03:01:08.590 --> 03:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
heard from the community college that uh
 
03:01:09.830 --> 03:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that's an opportunity to
 
03:01:11.190 --> 03:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
try and reach students who might not
 
03:01:13.269 --> 03:01:13.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise be postsecondary bound to
 
03:01:15.229 --> 03:01:15.239 align:start position:0%
engage them um but we also know that a
 
03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
number of those credits transfer out of
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
state uh because those students who are
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of those dual and
 
03:01:22.190 --> 03:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
concurrent programs are really seeking
 
03:01:24.550 --> 03:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
four-year degrees in some institution
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
outside of State uh we believe that by
 
03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
expanding those and we'll pilot this out
 
03:01:31.790 --> 03:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
to the university system uh there's no
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
need to go out of state to a four-year
 
03:01:35.070 --> 03:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
University because you can stay here at
 
03:01:38.229 --> 03:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
UNH or Keen or Plymouth State and uh and
 
03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and transfer those credits there as well
 
03:01:41.550 --> 03:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
so uh that is something we will be
 
03:01:43.630 --> 03:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
looking for um the next item The Adult
 
03:01:46.349 --> 03:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
Ed that you provided for us was $500,000
 
03:01:48.349 --> 03:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
this is really for our adult ed programs
 
03:01:50.229 --> 03:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
that uh really if you look at all of the
 
03:01:51.950 --> 03:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
various covid relief programs that had
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
come out uh there was not one that was
 
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
targeted directly at um you know the
 
03:01:58.630 --> 03:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
adult dead types of program so this was
 
03:02:01.030 --> 03:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
to support many of those programs uh
 
03:02:02.349 --> 03:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
across the state we've got 19 different
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
centers across the state and just to put
 
03:02:06.150 --> 03:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
that into context it's referred to as
 
03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
adult education um I tease the woman who
 
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
runs it Sarah Wheeler that she runs the
 
03:02:13.269 --> 03:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
largest High School in the state of New
 
03:02:15.309 --> 03:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh because the adult dead
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
program serve uh over 1,700
 
03:02:21.990 --> 03:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh 16 17 and 18yearold students who are
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
not participating in their uh assigned
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
high school and they're attaining their
 
03:02:29.309 --> 03:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
high school diploma or GED through the
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
adult dead programs um you know
 
03:02:32.790 --> 03:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes just too much drama over there
 
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is but they've got so she
 
03:02:35.349 --> 03:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
runs the largest High School in the
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um in terms of
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
Education trust fund uh you'll see the
 
03:02:41.910 --> 03:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund uh
 
03:02:44.030 --> 03:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
which was $10 million that we were
 
03:02:46.950 --> 03:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
awarded and these have been targeted and
 
03:02:49.750 --> 03:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
already appro at out to schools for
 
03:02:52.550 --> 03:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
safety grants um we work with the uh the
 
03:02:54.950 --> 03:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure committee
 
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
um and our Focus really has been on
 
03:02:58.590 --> 03:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
Access Control emergency alerting and
 
03:03:00.070 --> 03:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
surveillance systems we work very
 
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
closely with the Department of Homeland
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
Security uh to turn this around and
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
continue to um make those Investments
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
and making sure that our students and
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
our staff are safe in our school
 
03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
settings um and I would just want to say
 
03:03:15.550 --> 03:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you to the legislature because uh
 
03:03:16.870 --> 03:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the years that I've been in this
 
03:03:19.469 --> 03:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
position the legisl has uh provided well
 
03:03:23.389 --> 03:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
over $50 million towards safety um in
 
03:03:26.030 --> 03:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
the school system and you will see in my
 
03:03:28.110 --> 03:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
budget again I'm I have uh you know a
 
03:03:30.349 --> 03:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
line item for another $10 million 5
 
03:03:32.670 --> 03:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
million each year uh to continue that
 
03:03:34.429 --> 03:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
safety work because I think it needs to
 
03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
be an ongoing investment and not
 
03:03:38.429 --> 03:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
episodic we've not we've been uh
 
03:03:40.670 --> 03:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
fortunate to not have any um serious
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events in the state of New
 
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want to keep it that way uh
 
03:03:45.990 --> 03:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
and I think an ongoing focus and
 
03:03:48.269 --> 03:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
attention on this rather than a a a
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
reactionary approach is a better
 
03:03:51.309 --> 03:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
approach for that and I appreciate the
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
legislature supporting that um we have a
 
03:03:56.429 --> 03:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh a grant that the legislature provide
 
03:03:58.830 --> 03:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
us through one-term grants to support
 
03:04:00.910 --> 03:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation for our CTE
 
03:04:04.229 --> 03:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
centers uh to again open up additional
 
03:04:06.190 --> 03:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to afford schools to be
 
03:04:10.429 --> 03:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
able to um you know uh if if cost was a
 
03:04:13.469 --> 03:04:13.479 align:start position:0%
barrier of getting kids to uh Career and
 
03:04:15.150 --> 03:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
Technical education programming that
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
this grant would help overcome that
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
obstacle I would tell you that that's
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
not our number one obstacle but it is an
 
03:04:23.550 --> 03:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
important one um and so there is an open
 
03:04:25.309 --> 03:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
grant for schools to be able to apply
 
03:04:28.870 --> 03:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
when they have excess costs um that are
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
not reimbursed either through the normal
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
formula or through their local school
 
03:04:32.790 --> 03:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
district and they want to seek
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that they're able to
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
do that um kindergarten Aid is just uh a
 
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
line item that you all have given us for
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
a number of years or a number of budget
 
03:04:42.830 --> 03:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
Cycles at this point in time which is
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
for those students um those children who
 
03:04:47.150 --> 03:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
have been in half day programs and then
 
03:04:48.510 --> 03:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
a school dist District maybe opens up a
 
03:04:50.670 --> 03:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
full day kindergarten program and so
 
03:04:52.429 --> 03:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
this is a supplement to that additional
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
tuition that would uh take place in that
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
first year it's a onetime item um we
 
03:05:00.229 --> 03:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
also received funding last year for a
 
03:05:03.269 --> 03:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
new program uh episodes of treatment uh
 
03:05:05.190 --> 03:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
a couple by anyo you all pass the
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
program the fast forward program which
 
03:05:09.910 --> 03:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
allows HHS to intervene uh when there's
 
03:05:12.429 --> 03:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
an acute mental illness uh issue for a
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
particular student uh when that happens
 
03:05:18.910 --> 03:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
there is uh uh cost Associated often
 
03:05:22.229 --> 03:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
times with a um kind of a a deployment
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
or a placement of a child in some type
 
03:05:26.150 --> 03:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
of an alternative setting while they're
 
03:05:28.110 --> 03:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
through that recovery process and so
 
03:05:29.790 --> 03:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
these are funds that we coordinate with
 
03:05:32.429 --> 03:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
HHS to be able to uh provide for the
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
education of those students who are um
 
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
you know temporarily displaced from
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
their maybe resident District or
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
whatever other placement they're in if
 
03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
they have to go to a special placement
 
03:05:43.550 --> 03:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh until they get stabilized and can
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
join back in to our school settings and
 
03:05:47.429 --> 03:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
then the last two items which I think
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
are important for the legislature to be
 
03:05:52.469 --> 03:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
considering is uh two CTE projects um
 
03:05:54.670 --> 03:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know Sugar River for 12.5 wi Squam
 
03:05:58.389 --> 03:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
for 6 7.6 million um historically these
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
projects have been funded through the
 
03:06:02.750 --> 03:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
capital budget uh in this last banian
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
budget they were not they were included
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
as uh one-time projects of surplus funds
 
03:06:10.990 --> 03:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
um but I can tell you that at present I
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
have three uh you know proposed CTE
 
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
Renovations coming that will probably
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
come before for you um they've not all
 
03:06:21.309 --> 03:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
been approved locally by their uh their
 
03:06:22.950 --> 03:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
communities but those are activities
 
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
that are being worked on um they are
 
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
larger projects uh they the they amount
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
to close to $60 million which would
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably be the highest number the
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
highest value of the projects that I've
 
03:06:36.349 --> 03:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
seen since I've been in this role um but
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
those will be coming and and should be
 
03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
something to consider because if the you
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
know without this year they these CTE
 
03:06:44.429 --> 03:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
projects again historically in the
 
03:06:46.710 --> 03:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget not in this last capital
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
budget but we'll probably come back to
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
that capital
 
03:06:52.590 --> 03:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
budget on the next slide I just wanted
 
03:06:54.910 --> 03:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
to focus um a couple of items for
 
03:06:56.469 --> 03:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs that were included in
 
03:06:58.750 --> 03:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
our uh budget uh the first two are
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
really administrative um you know
 
03:07:02.790 --> 03:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
03:07:06.030 --> 03:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
asked us to include a a um a rent item
 
03:07:08.910 --> 03:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
as a prioritized needs do doit had us
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
put a placeholder down there for a
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
dollar I'm going to guess that if they
 
03:07:13.550 --> 03:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
do charge me it's going to be more than
 
03:07:16.710 --> 03:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
a dollar I hope not but I don't know um
 
03:07:17.950 --> 03:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
and then the other two that I'm going to
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
flag for you is uh you know we've had
 
03:07:22.630 --> 03:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
we've been flush with covid cash for a
 
03:07:24.670 --> 03:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
number of years um as a result of the
 
03:07:27.150 --> 03:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we've been able to uh you
 
03:07:29.830 --> 03:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
know carry forward a number of different
 
03:07:32.070 --> 03:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh educational programs in the state to
 
03:07:34.950 --> 03:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
be able to um support the schools and
 
03:07:37.150 --> 03:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
try and encourage and help make up lost
 
03:07:38.910 --> 03:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
learning that took place uh these
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
included things like a letters program
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
which is uh training over 5,000
 
03:07:46.950 --> 03:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
Educators and early childhood uh workers
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the science of reading to make sure
 
03:07:50.670 --> 03:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
that our students are getting making
 
03:07:53.190 --> 03:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
progress there um there was a program
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
called rekindling curiosity uh every kid
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
was able to uh go to Camp kind of thing
 
03:08:00.349 --> 03:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh for it started out as a program for
 
03:08:02.510 --> 03:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
disabled uh or for uh low-income
 
03:08:04.830 --> 03:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
students to be able to get to Camp uh we
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
partnered in that program with the
 
03:08:08.030 --> 03:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
community Behavioral Health Association
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we're able to provide a number of
 
03:08:11.469 --> 03:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
mental health support services to
 
03:08:13.190 --> 03:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
students and families in our camps
 
03:08:15.469 --> 03:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and was a very uh
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
successful program uh we had tutor.com
 
03:08:19.710 --> 03:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
so that every student in the state of
 
03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had access to 247 tutoring
 
03:08:24.630 --> 03:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
Services we've got kigo which is an
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence online platform
 
03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
that accelerates and assists teachers
 
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
and students in their Learning Classroom
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh but two that I've included here in
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
our um you know prioritize needs one is
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
a learning platform so this is for
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
Discovery education so Discovery
 
03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
Education was high quality instruction
 
03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
materials that we rolled out to uh
 
03:08:48.469 --> 03:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
schools in the pandemic mic what we saw
 
03:08:50.349 --> 03:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
initially in the pandemic was some
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
schools were able to provide high
 
03:08:52.950 --> 03:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
quality materials other schools were
 
03:08:54.830 --> 03:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
still sending home manila envelopes that
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
really were less high quality um and we
 
03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that all of our
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
students had access to high quality uh
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
instruction materials we rolled this
 
03:09:04.590 --> 03:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
program out um and what we saw
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly is that
 
03:09:10.349 --> 03:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
100% of New Hampshire public schools are
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
using the discovery platform at this
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
point in time um and I would tell you
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
that I say this somewhat factiously so
 
03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
don't anybody be offended by the joke I
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
could offer gold bars to my schools and
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
some would say like nah we're good here
 
03:09:23.630 --> 03:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
we don't have any place to store them
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
right so the fact that 100% of the
 
03:09:27.269 --> 03:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
schools are using a platform I mean it
 
03:09:29.630 --> 03:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
communicates to me uh that this is a
 
03:09:32.110 --> 03:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
platform that is valued U by the
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
districts um clearly because we're
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
providing them uh you know curricular
 
03:09:38.590 --> 03:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
materials there's a degree of offset I
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what that degree is because
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
it happens very locally um but we are
 
03:09:43.990 --> 03:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
supporting them with this platform and
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
we're and so I'm I'm continuing uh
 
03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
seeking continu funny for that and then
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
the next item is really uh State
 
03:09:54.910 --> 03:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
assessment funding um so today we do
 
03:09:57.150 --> 03:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
assessments for students uh federally
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
required in grades 3 through eight and
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
then again once in high school and we
 
03:10:05.269 --> 03:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
provide that once in high school is the
 
03:10:07.510 --> 03:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
SAT that the students participate in in
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
11th grade the difficulty with that is
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
that you don't really have very good
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
trajectory information you don't know
 
03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
how those students are progressing um we
 
03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
think that a PSA or a similar instrument
 
03:10:20.670 --> 03:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm not I don't want to be uh
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
bound to a particular uh vendor or
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
instrument but a you know kind of a
 
03:10:27.750 --> 03:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
ninth grade assessment would give uh
 
03:10:30.349 --> 03:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
students or give Educators and
 
03:10:32.429 --> 03:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
administrators trajectory information on
 
03:10:33.469 --> 03:10:33.479 align:start position:0%
how those students are doing right
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
because if you give the kid the test in
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
11th grade and you get that result at
 
03:10:39.030 --> 03:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the 11th grade and they're
 
03:10:40.349 --> 03:10:40.359 align:start position:0%
they're behind it's really hard to
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
scramble and make that up in one year
 
03:10:43.070 --> 03:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to happen right so
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
we need better information I think would
 
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
be useful um it was interesting I spoke
 
03:10:49.309 --> 03:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
with um the superintendent from one of
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
our largest school districts in the
 
03:10:51.630 --> 03:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
state today and we were having a
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
conversation about this they themselves
 
03:10:56.229 --> 03:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
are already running this so a number of
 
03:10:58.110 --> 03:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
the schools have recognized the value
 
03:11:00.429 --> 03:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
associated with doing this um and again
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is one of those programs I want to
 
03:11:03.269 --> 03:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
make sure it's not one of those halves
 
03:11:04.830 --> 03:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
and have not the school districts have
 
03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to do something like this
 
03:11:08.229 --> 03:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
and get good information about the
 
03:11:09.550 --> 03:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
progress of their students academic
 
03:11:11.229 --> 03:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
achievement are doing it and others are
 
03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
not um so that is why is it it is been
 
03:11:16.630 --> 03:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
has been listed as a prioritized need um
 
03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
the next and last slide that I will
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
present to you is really um we currently
 
03:11:24.550 --> 03:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
have 306 full-time positions um we are
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
requesting 10 new position requests and
 
03:11:29.469 --> 03:11:29.479 align:start position:0%
this is uh these are all federally
 
03:11:31.110 --> 03:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
funded this is in our disability
 
03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
determination Services Bureau um and you
 
03:11:35.349 --> 03:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
may for those of you who have seen a few
 
03:11:37.030 --> 03:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
of these budgets we've actually
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
increased this I've expanded I get
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
nervous every time I see these headcount
 
03:11:42.070 --> 03:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
numbers go up right but essentially
 
03:11:43.389 --> 03:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
what's happening is we're doing a good
 
03:11:45.150 --> 03:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
job for the federal government we
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
basically are a service center to the
 
03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
Social Security Administration uh we
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
provide the adjudication for uh
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
disability determinations uh they like
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
the work that they are that we are doing
 
03:11:58.630 --> 03:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
and so this would be we just recently
 
03:12:01.229 --> 03:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
got another request to increase our
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
capacity to provide more support
 
03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
services uh when they do that they
 
03:12:05.950 --> 03:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
increase our funding they pay for these
 
03:12:08.110 --> 03:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
additional stuff so over the years uh
 
03:12:09.469 --> 03:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
they've come to us three times now and
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
said can you do more work for us and so
 
03:12:14.710 --> 03:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh those new 10 positions are uh
 
03:12:17.349 --> 03:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
positions that are requested um for that
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
work and that is in the budget um and so
 
03:12:21.790 --> 03:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
with that I will pause and take
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions that you may
 
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
have thank you commissioner first I just
 
03:12:28.150 --> 03:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
want to like uh go over a couple of
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
figures uh which I which I think tell a
 
03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
a a interesting story here yeah uh that
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
you present uh from 2020 to 2024 local
 
03:12:40.269 --> 03:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
spending has gone from 3.2 billion up to
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
3.86 billion uh State spending from the
 
03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund has gone from 1
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
billion to 1.25 billion which is about a
 
03:12:50.349 --> 03:12:50.359 align:start position:0%
15% increase that state the local
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
increase was about 12% but meanwhile uh
 
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment has fallen from 163,000 to
 
03:12:58.990 --> 03:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
151,000 or
 
03:13:02.070 --> 03:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
6.7% decrease and that's meant that the
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
average cost per pup has grown from
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
16,000 roughly to uh over 21,000 per
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
person my question is why is education
 
03:13:15.070 --> 03:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
expenditures going up so much and I'm
 
03:13:17.550 --> 03:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
going to sort of borrow a question that
 
03:13:18.910 --> 03:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
that commissioner Arling house asked
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
earlier and that is the relationship
 
03:13:21.359 --> 03:13:22.510 align:start position:0%
earlier and that is the relationship
between

03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
administrative and teachers uh is this
 
03:13:27.229 --> 03:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
money being spent on teachers or
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
administrators and what have you seen in
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
the ratio between those two over the
 
03:13:32.830 --> 03:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
last five 10 years yes so there have
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
been um several studies that have taken
 
03:13:36.349 --> 03:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
place independent studies that have
 
03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
looked at that and what you have seen is
 
03:13:40.590 --> 03:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
an increase in the percentage of
 
03:13:42.830 --> 03:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
Administrators um in the school
 
03:13:45.030 --> 03:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
buildings uh those administrators
 
03:13:47.790 --> 03:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
include uh your traditional
 
03:13:49.870 --> 03:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
administrative roles such as uh you know
 
03:13:52.030 --> 03:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
like we've got superintendant maybe uh
 
03:13:53.710 --> 03:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendents or principles
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
and assistant principles again that same
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
um you know admin superintendent from
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
one of our larger systems that I was
 
03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
talking to today uh you know is looking
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
for opportunities to to to move this
 
03:14:06.870 --> 03:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
down and was indicating that there's a
 
03:14:10.110 --> 03:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
lot of resistance uh they were hoping to
 
03:14:12.750 --> 03:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
have uh you know to cons have have two
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
systems that they've seen the number
 
03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
these are these are two buildings that
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
are already connected it's a middle
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
school and a elementary school and in
 
03:14:21.910 --> 03:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
the midle school and Elementary School
 
03:14:23.750 --> 03:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
they've seen the number of students come
 
03:14:26.110 --> 03:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
down considerably but each the middle
 
03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
school and the elementary school in
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
buildings that are connected have each
 
03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
has a principal each has a system
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
principles and they're thinking like can
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
we just have one principal and then an
 
03:14:37.710 --> 03:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
assistant principal over each um and and
 
03:14:39.150 --> 03:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
the the superintendent I was speaking
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
with expressed a great deal of
 
03:14:42.190 --> 03:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
frustration that there was a lot of
 
03:14:44.910 --> 03:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
resistance uh among the staff uh to be
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
able to do something like that so so I I
 
03:14:49.150 --> 03:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
don't have specific uh information to
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
share with you but I do know that there
 
03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
have been some thirdparty studies that
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
have indicated a shift in terms of the
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
um you know the number of Administrators
 
03:15:01.269 --> 03:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
to the number of Staff uh you know in
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
some of our buildings um but there have
 
03:15:05.670 --> 03:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
been an increase relative to some of the
 
03:15:07.590 --> 03:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
non-traditional administrative roles as
 
03:15:09.710 --> 03:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
well you're seeing a higher number of
 
03:15:12.110 --> 03:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know school counselors you're um you
 
03:15:13.229 --> 03:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
know you're seeing a higher number of
 
03:15:14.710 --> 03:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
school psychologists you're seeing a
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
higher number of welfare um support
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
staff that are in the schools as the
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
schools uh you know some some sometimes
 
03:15:23.710 --> 03:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
by default because those students are
 
03:15:26.189 --> 03:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
there are taking over functions um and
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
supporting those kids with the objective
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
of trying to ensure that learning is
 
03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
taking place but um you know if I knew
 
03:15:36.429 --> 03:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
the answer to why the cost the per pupil
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
cost of education is uh is going up like
 
03:15:41.469 --> 03:15:41.479 align:start position:0%
that um like that's The $64,000 Question
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
I would put that number on that
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
Powerball the next time I at a billion
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
dollar so I would be there uh
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
so um so we see that happening but
 
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
another aspect of it that you have to
 
03:15:54.429 --> 03:15:54.439 align:start position:0%
consider is that what we have is a
 
03:15:55.990 --> 03:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
system that has a high degree of fixed
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
cost in its system um and a reducing
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
number of students is obviously then
 
03:16:03.070 --> 03:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to result you know mathematically
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
in a higher number of cost per pupil
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
right so we have uh sometimes to be able
 
03:16:10.389 --> 03:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to be necessary to make more
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
and more uh harder and difficult
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
decisions in communities to be able to
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that we've got a system
 
03:16:19.189 --> 03:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
that fits the constituent that we're
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to be serving and I don't think
 
03:16:22.670 --> 03:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
that that's unique to the K12 system I
 
03:16:23.950 --> 03:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
think that applies to the community
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
college system I think it applies the
 
03:16:27.309 --> 03:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
university system as well um that
 
03:16:29.910 --> 03:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
they've got large fix fixed cost
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
campuses um and the number of students
 
03:16:35.309 --> 03:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
like I said my class of 2036 started
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten this year right so we know
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
how many of these kids are going to show
 
03:16:41.469 --> 03:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
up plus or minus a very small variation
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
so we should be planning for that future
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think that you know it's
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
important to be up optimistic but it's
 
03:16:49.630 --> 03:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
also important to be realistic and
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
understand kind of the realities of the
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:00.750 --> 03:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
you hey how are you I'm good um I have a
 
03:17:02.830 --> 03:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
couple of questions one is can you talk
 
03:17:04.790 --> 03:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
talk me through building Aid yeah
 
03:17:07.070 --> 03:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a tale from the money
 
03:17:08.990 --> 03:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
we borrowed years ago and then are you
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
doing additional
 
03:17:12.990 --> 03:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
expenses building Aid projects I don't
 
03:17:14.429 --> 03:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
yeah so the way we were instructed in
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
our budgeting process to basically
 
03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
include the tail here and then let the
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislators decide what it is that they
 
03:17:21.950 --> 03:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
want to do relative building Aid so
 
03:17:24.590 --> 03:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see if you go down to the bottom
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
building a is 1 2 3 4 five six seven
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
lines up and you cut across it's got uh
 
03:17:34.670 --> 03:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
14, 762 and then 12 M39 those are tail
 
03:17:36.349 --> 03:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
numbers so those are those so what was
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
the 43 last
 
03:17:41.229 --> 03:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
year um so that was the appropriation
 
03:17:43.429 --> 03:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
that we received and so do we do new
 
03:17:45.229 --> 03:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
projects yeah we do have some building
 
03:17:47.070 --> 03:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
projects that are ongoing and do they
 
03:17:49.429 --> 03:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
have additional tail they don't have
 
03:17:51.710 --> 03:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
tail no no we don't no this is all pay
 
03:17:53.189 --> 03:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
as you go at this point in time the the
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
tail is I origin we're do we're not
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
doing over 10 years anymore no we don't
 
03:17:59.630 --> 03:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
these are all this is pay as you go all
 
03:18:00.590 --> 03:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
the projects that we've done for at
 
03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
least the last eight years have been pay
 
03:18:03.830 --> 03:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
as you go okay so like here's six
 
03:18:05.910 --> 03:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
million take it yeah exactly right take
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
it or leave it and then if they don't
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
want it they we give it to the next
 
03:18:11.950 --> 03:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
person in line so okay
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about lawsuits you
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
may have noticed that there have been
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
educ funding
 
03:18:19.630 --> 03:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuits I think that could have been
 
03:18:21.229 --> 03:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
set at every budget hearing for the last
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
40 years um but
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
um what happens do you have like what
 
03:18:29.830 --> 03:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
happens if some of them
 
03:18:32.750 --> 03:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
go you know some of the bigger lawsuits
 
03:18:34.910 --> 03:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
could go this way or that way and do you
 
03:18:36.870 --> 03:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
have contingency plans if they go this
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
way or that way um so we do I have to be
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
a little bit cautious because these are
 
03:18:45.070 --> 03:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh ongoing legal matters that I'm I'm
 
03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
I'm involved in obviously named in
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits um but I can tell you that
 
03:18:52.590 --> 03:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
there have been uh contingency plans
 
03:18:53.950 --> 03:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
that have been discussed with the
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
legislature even as early as last spring
 
03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
um there are uh you know things that can
 
03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:02.349 align:start position:0%
um there are uh you know things that can
be

03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:19:04.950 --> 03:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
done okay I guess I'll I guess I'll drop
 
03:19:07.950 --> 03:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
it there at that point um and a question
 
03:19:10.630 --> 03:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
I've been asking a bunch of agencies so
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
just to go back so if your question is
 
03:19:14.309 --> 03:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
do I have an extra $500 million in this
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
budget I don't well it's not hidden in a
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
some line item okay I was guessing that
 
03:19:22.590 --> 03:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
or else you didn't roll everything up
 
03:19:24.510 --> 03:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
right prioritize
 
03:19:27.349 --> 03:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
need um question I've been asking a
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
bunch of people is what if you so in the
 
03:19:33.070 --> 03:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
so your general and your education funds
 
03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
total anyway don't go down a lot um what
 
03:19:40.150 --> 03:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
what if the budget situation um let's
 
03:19:42.670 --> 03:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
just say the the the new governor coming
 
03:19:46.429 --> 03:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
in um decides that where we are today is
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
not supported by the revenues that we
 
03:19:51.229 --> 03:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
expect to have and and let's say you
 
03:19:54.269 --> 03:19:54.279 align:start position:0%
have to cut an additional four or 5% out
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
of both the education trust fund and the
 
03:19:58.830 --> 03:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
general fund have you started internal
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
discussions on what that would look like
 
03:20:02.189 --> 03:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
so what I would I'd start with the fact
 
03:20:03.830 --> 03:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we've already taken 4% out of our
 
03:20:06.349 --> 03:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
budget year-over-year right so we've
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
already taken 4 per out I mean if you
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
tell me I have to go take another 4% out
 
03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
then we will go take another 4% out um
 
03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
that's my question yeah so I mean that's
 
03:20:17.429 --> 03:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
really a function of the legislature the
 
03:20:19.630 --> 03:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
legislature tells us what Target they
 
03:20:21.830 --> 03:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
want us on and or the governor or the
 
03:20:23.710 --> 03:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
governor right and we will meet that
 
03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
Target but it it's my way of saying
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
let's say that came to pass yeah um it
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be good if you started internally
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about that well I mean I think
 
03:20:36.990 --> 03:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
not next week so it's I don't think that
 
03:20:38.830 --> 03:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's a function of thinking about that I
 
03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
mean like we those um contingency
 
03:20:44.349 --> 03:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
scenarios are ones that even as an
 
03:20:45.550 --> 03:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
agency we're playing through in our
 
03:20:47.550 --> 03:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
heads all along right like okay so what
 
03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
if right okay the covor gives me a
 
03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
certain Target and we have budgeted and
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
produced and delivered that Target uh
 
03:20:56.429 --> 03:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
but then we also like you hypothetically
 
03:20:57.710 --> 03:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
can say like okay suppose I got to take
 
03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
another 5% out suppose I got to they
 
03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
come back and he tells me I want another
 
03:21:04.030 --> 03:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
5% above like I don't want it just to be
 
03:21:05.870 --> 03:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
you don't if it's 5% more I don't want
 
03:21:08.189 --> 03:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
that to be a capricious decision and a
 
03:21:09.870 --> 03:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
and a knee-jerk reaction you want to be
 
03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
very strategic about what it is that you
 
03:21:12.910 --> 03:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
would invest those funds
 
03:21:16.229 --> 03:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
in um good okay the other my last
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
question is related to there have been
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
some news reports uh recently about
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's some discussion in Washington
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
about taking a lot of the federal money
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
and uh I I don't know exactly what how
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
exactly they're talking about this but
 
03:21:31.150 --> 03:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
what if they block granted it to the
 
03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
states or something like that have you I
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
don't honestly think that's going to
 
03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
come to pass because because of you know
 
03:21:40.269 --> 03:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
politics but if it did happen have you
 
03:21:42.030 --> 03:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
started thinking about that so we have
 
03:21:44.110 --> 03:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
we've already started the the you know
 
03:21:45.910 --> 03:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
again we also have no additional
 
03:21:47.790 --> 03:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
information Beyond what you know but in
 
03:21:50.070 --> 03:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
the event that we see received roughly
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
$270 million from the feds um I would
 
03:21:55.710 --> 03:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
assume if they achieved the full extent
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
of their plan and uh were able to
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the full Department of
 
03:21:59.790 --> 03:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
Education I think that includes about
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
initial $2 billion doar of uh Personnel
 
03:22:05.670 --> 03:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
cost related uh in DC I don't know if
 
03:22:06.990 --> 03:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
that just becomes a cut or if that
 
03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
becomes part of the Blan Grant but um
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know so we have begun the thought
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
process of what does it look like if
 
03:22:15.870 --> 03:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
$270 million is block granted to the
 
03:22:17.790 --> 03:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
state so that we would understand
 
03:22:19.469 --> 03:22:19.479 align:start position:0%
strategically what would that what would
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
we want how how would that be directed
 
03:22:23.950 --> 03:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
um and obviously it would be highly
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
contingent on the nature of the block
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
grant because even block grants come
 
03:22:28.990 --> 03:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes with strings attached to them
 
03:22:31.229 --> 03:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of how they can be deployed um
 
03:22:33.550 --> 03:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
and what they might be deployed for um
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
but those we are thinking about them
 
03:22:39.070 --> 03:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
good I
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.469 --> 03:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank you
 
03:22:49.750 --> 03:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay and with
 
03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
that we are in recess until 8:30
 
03:22:53.399 --> 03:22:54.910 align:start position:0%
that we are in recess until 8:30
tomorrow

03:22:54.910 --> 03:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:23:15.429 --> 03:23:15.439 align:start position:0%
