00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
at the amount of the expenditures we
 
00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
think that's a little bit High we're
 
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
narrowing the bill
 
00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
the 16 beds or less to licenses of 804
 
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
I was not aware that there were so many
 
00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
licenses for assisted living facilities
 
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 align:start position:0%
so it's going to redefine
 
00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
the number of beds in the facilities
 
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards Edwards yes sir I
 
00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I'm I'm reading
 
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about I I the only
 
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
piece of paper I have on 527 in front of
 
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 align:start position:0%
me is uh marked 0522 it sounds to me
 
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
like you have an amendment available to
 
00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 align:start position:0%
you that's got a complete a more
 
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
complete fiscal note on it and so if you
 
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
have a different document we should be
 
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
looking at it I'd like to uh we just
 
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
asked for the amendment I'm not going to
 
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
have it available for about another 45
 
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.130 align:start position:0%
have it available for about another 45
minutes

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh but the intent of the amendment is to
 
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
Simply replace the content here thank
 
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
okay so uh rather than uh confuse
 
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
everybody with uh with the changes and
 
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
the content of this if you would be so
 
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
kind Mr chairman and allow Mr Campbell
 
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
to come up
 
00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
and explain what the facility consists
 
00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
of and how the license impacts the
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
amount that's being asked for so the
 
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
content is good we're talking 16 beds or
 
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
less uh the amount is 115 or 16 a day
 
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh for Medicaid patients and uh he's got
 
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
all the details of the numbers so if he
 
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
would allow him I will turn this over to
 
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.050 align:start position:0%
would allow him I will turn this over to
him

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions from any of the committee
 
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.870 align:start position:0%
questions from any of the committee
members

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
obviously we have an amendment we have
 
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
to look at later
 
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I that'll happen in division three I
 
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
so you said the next person to be expert
 
00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 align:start position:0%
is is Ann Campbell will invite her to
 
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a little unorthodox I'm uh The
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
Honorable Campbell uh I think you
 
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
remember me from Farmington this is my
 
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
sister Anne and I was wondering if we
 
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
could just do our testimony together
 
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
yes give give us your name and we'll add
 
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie my real secret
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
name is Wayne
 
00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 align:start position:0%
Swain Packy Campbell so now the secret
 
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
is out but I had the opportunity to
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
serve and then Hampshire legislature
 
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
with the chairman Weiler and we had a
 
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 align:start position:0%
lot so long I don't recognize you
 
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
know what's scary
 
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
I do recognize you and it was 20 years
 
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
ago and you haven't changed a bit
 
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.770 align:start position:0%
ago and you haven't changed a bit
congratulations

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to follow my mother's lead
 
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
she looked the same at a hundred as she
 
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
I won't ask whether you were 70 then or
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
70 now
 
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
we got to get this button thing down
 
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 align:start position:0%
hit it once I'm good okay so uh my name
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
is uh Wayne Campbell and uh my
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
sister Ann and I started a uh assisted
 
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
living facility and I think that's the
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
first thing that we'll explain is it's
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
licensed that's the 504 license and we
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
have a copy of that license so when I
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
asked representative Horgan and
 
00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie if they would
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor this legislation we put in
 
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility up to 16 beds
 
00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 align:start position:0%
and that has a very uh important import
 
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
that means an 804 license
 
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
in the methodology from Health and Human
 
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
Services I think there was a little
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
miscommunication in that they included
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
all licensed facilities and that was not
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislation so as a
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
former legislator I I agree that there's
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
some clarity that's that's perhaps
 
00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
warranted and that would be that instead
 
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
of saying a an assisted living facility
 
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
up to 16 beds we would just say a 60
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
living facility with an 804 Residential
 
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
Care license and what that does is
 
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
really narrow the scope of what we're
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
talking about today and I don't mean to
 
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
put Health and Human Services on on the
 
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
spot and I wish I had let them know
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
ahead of time but I would hope that in
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
division three or later when you look at
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
that Amendment they could give you an
 
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
updated fiscal note that would address
 
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
The Limited number of beds in the state
 
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and quite honestly I
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how many there are but I know
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the 805 license which is more of a
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care license more nursing
 
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 align:start position:0%
care are a higher level of
 
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
in room services for lack of a better
 
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
term it's different
 
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless an 804 facility as an
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility is a
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
residential care facility provides even
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
more services in my opinion than an 805
 
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
and what I mean is and my sister will
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
speak to this a little bit more is they
 
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
take you to the hairdresser they take
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
you to activities you're you're getting
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
assistance with your living you're
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
getting Med management so all the all
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
the staff are Med certified you have one
 
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
RN instead of necessarily RNs going in
 
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
and given the service at the same time
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
but you really have in my opinion a
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
higher level of service so again the 804
 
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
clarification is important because one
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the notes in the fiscal note is that
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
oh we don't know how to pay different
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
rates to different facilities when in
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
fact when you look at the fiscal note
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
they pay 58 dollars a night for some
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
facilities 804s and they pay 95 a night
 
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming for 805s or other
 
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
facilities so there is a precedent that
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
you would pay facilities at different
 
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
rates and I'm asking you to do that for
 
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
a couple of reasons one I'm partners
 
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 align:start position:0%
with my three sisters so anybody who
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
votes against this they're voting
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
against my sisters that's not
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
you know not a good idea so
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
um so when we opened this facility it
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
was right when covet hit it took over a
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
year to get the approval and I will tell
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
you there was a a substantial amount of
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
confusion on the requirements and just
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
for visual aid uh Mr chairman
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
in this packet you have 804 license
 
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
administrative rules different than 805
 
00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 align:start position:0%
license administrative rules
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
definitionally they're very similar
 
00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
requirements are very similar uh just to
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
give you one example 805 is nfp101 where
 
00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
804 is a different fire Life Safety Code
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit less
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
so there's lots of little nuances like
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to get into it I just
 
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
want to make the point that they are
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
different levels of almost like a
 
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
private school versus a public school
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
just a different set of rules but
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
they're both licensed schools different
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
set of rules they're both licensed care
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
facilities one is specifically an
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility and that's what
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is about
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
um that right now for a small facility
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
to exist in New Hampshire if you get
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
paid the Medicare rate it's just not
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
enough because you don't know what
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
you're going to get in matching Social
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
Security funds or matching funds from
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
their retirement if they had one and
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
this bill not only will help this very
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
limited number of facilities but I want
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
to point out it's really going to help
 
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
patients in the facility if you end up
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
and I look around this room no reference
 
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
to the earlier comments but if you're
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
nearing that time frame where you might
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
be in an assisted living facility you
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
might want to support this bill because
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is if you're not
 
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
quite out of you know you're still
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
driving maybe you can still self-shower
 
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
there's rules that that you have to be
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
able to do to be in one of these
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
facilities so if you're in that
 
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
situation you can only keep 72 dollars a
 
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.629 align:start position:0%
situation you can only keep 72 dollars a
month

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
so if it costs 4 500 a month to be in
 
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
one of these facilities one of the
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
cheapest rates in the state
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
and your Social Security is only seven
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
that's not going to even be the average
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get you to 4 500 so
 
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get you close with the
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
current rate of 59 a month
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
matter of fact if you increase the rate
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
to 115 dollars a day it only gets you to
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
3 200 from the Medicare reimbursement
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
rate and then you're still going to
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
probably have to pay on average is about
 
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollars and when they
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
accept the client they don't get to know
 
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
what their social security is they don't
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
get to know what their retirement money
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
might may or may not be so here they
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
have these people in desperate need that
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
a lot of times are homeless this bill
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
will address head on the elderly
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
homelessness population in a very
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
positive way by providing beds for these
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
people that are high functioning enough
 
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
that they can almost take care of
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
themselves but not quite
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
and when they're faced with the decision
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
of moving into a facility and know that
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
the only funds they're going to have
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
available to them is 72 dollars a month
 
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's a problem
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
so if you increase it to 115 someone
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
who's making more than a thousand
 
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
dollars a month in their retirement or
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
more than a thousand dollars a month in
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
their social security or whatever those
 
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
different levels of income is they'd be
 
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
able to keep that money over the
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars not just the 72 bucks
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill is important not just for
 
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
the facilities but for this population
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
try living on 72 dollars a month
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
I know I'm happy that my mother is a
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
client in this facility
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
um and I'm probably not supposed to say
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
and I give her 200 you know I give her
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
money because she can't live on 72
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
dollars a month and if she didn't have
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
me as her son that's what the state
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
requires her to do so that's one of the
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
biggest problems I want to help these
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
individuals I want to make sure that if
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
if you understand if you're a person who
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a payee and we made the
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
mistake early on we accepted some
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
clients who didn't have a state payee
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
okay if you don't have a state payee and
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
someone's getting a thousand bucks a
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
month and they're being told they got to
 
00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339 align:start position:0%
give you 918 dollars of that money good
 
00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
give you 918 dollars of that money good
luck

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
luck
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
I mean desperate people do desperate
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
things so then all of a sudden all we're
 
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
getting is this reduced Medicare rate
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
and we have a 72 year old borderline
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
homeless person in our facility paying a
 
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
third of the money they should be paying
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's a problem and it will bankrupt
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
these smaller facilities and I would say
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
to you that the data I'd like you to
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
look at is what where the 804 license
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
facilities post covid what are the 804
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
license facility after covid
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie from Farmington
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
Horgan from Farmington we have a place
 
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
called Hattie's place that was
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
demolished turned back on they were
 
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
trying to get an 804 license three years
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
ago when we were trying to get the 804
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
license and the state repeatedly wanted
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
them to be to an assisted care uh
 
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
license criteria to the 805 or that and
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
they claimed it was a miscommunication I
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
would boldly say that the state would
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
rather have Continuum of Care facilities
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
and that's fine if that's their policy
 
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
change the law right now the law is
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
licensed for 804 facilities and they
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
serve a vital and important role for
 
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
assisted living and there's a lot of
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
people that will be in that level of
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
care for a long period of time the
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
public policy problem is when they
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
transition to a nursing home there's a
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
transition that has to happen that's a
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
negative I can't disagree with that if
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
you're in a facility that does every
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
level of care you can stay in that
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
facility but you're really not you're
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
moving to a different section or you
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
move into a different thing and my last
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
point that I'll make take is that that
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill favors small businesses
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs like us from New Hampshire
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
it supports the North Country it
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
supports entrepreneurs opening up small
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and instead we have higher
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
levels of pay for facilities that are
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
owned by hedge funds or large companies
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
and I think in New Hampshire being a
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
small state with a lot of small
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
businesses being the backbone of our
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
economy and our employment whenever that
 
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I know this is a fiscal committee
 
00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:05.579 align:start position:0%
but whenever there's a an opportunity to
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
fiscally support small businesses we
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
should lean heavily in that direction
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
because it's very important that we have
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
more of these small businesses because I
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
hope as my sister will tell you briefly
 
00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:17.660 align:start position:0%
I know I talk too much I'm sorry
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
that we are able to provide a level of
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
care that you're not going to get in a
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
hunter bed facility we're able to
 
00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
provide a level of care that it's her my
 
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
sister Elaine in the kitchen my sister
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
Sharon who's an RN and my mom doing
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
activities while she's living there it's
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
a wonderful facility and when we look
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
looked at all the facilities of buying
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
an existing location I saw a lot of
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
family-run small businesses that these
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
people were connected in the lives of
 
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
their clients and they and and quite
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm being asked to subsidize 11
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
people in uh Charlestown New Hampshire
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
and I do that because one of them is my
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
mother but I I if we don't have a
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
fiscally reasonable payment plan 58
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
dollars isn't it 115 is a reasonable
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
plan where maybe the people get to keep
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
a little bit of their money maybe we can
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
have a profitable business model and
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we can you know uh not continue to
 
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
go into debt but to pay down debt and
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
with that I'll let my sister answer any
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have about the
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
day-to-days of the facility and and how
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
important this would be to improve the
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
lives of their clients there
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
I think I kept track between what you
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
were talking about monthly payments and
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
daily payments but you seem to use
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
monthly for all of them but I have it
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
all written out and have turned a copy
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
over to your LBA staff very good
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
chair I for the sake of the question
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
just assume that everything you said
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me uh this is strictly a
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
process question do you do you do you
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
have somebody in working for a DHHS like
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
for Henry lippman or somebody we're
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
we're one we're less than one week away
 
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
from having uh the budget provided to us
 
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
to start working on and this this is one
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
issue of multiple issues that we have to
 
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
deal with in Medicaid and so rather than
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with this as a separate bill I'm
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
just asking you if you have support in
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
the department to where we could just
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
roll this into our budget process and
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
take a look at all all of the moving
 
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:27.380 align:start position:0%
parts and not just one piece at a time
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
I hope that I have support of the
 
00:14:31.069 --> 00:14:31.079 align:start position:0%
department I think it's a good idea and
 
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
I think so do you know I'm not talking
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
about Hope unfortunately not being
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
connected in here every day like you are
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
I do not have a relationship with DHS
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what their position is
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
on the bill but I'd be happy to meet
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
with them get back to you before the
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
work session and I'd also just to answer
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
what I think is your question
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards if you want to
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
handle this as part of the budget and
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
notice a separate bill and I know that
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to look at those
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
rate pays for 804 and put it in the
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
budget however we skin the cat I'm fine
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
with that as long as we accomplish
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
getting 804 facilities a reasonable pay
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
58 isn't it so if you want to put that
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
in the budget I would welcome that I
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
don't think that we need a separate bill
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
I just think we need to accomplish the
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
additional payment level
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you Mr
 
00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you Mr
chair

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative for a question
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
two quick questions do you have any idea
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
how many 804 facilities there are on the
 
00:15:32.449 --> 00:15:32.459 align:start position:0%
state and how many total beds do they
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
contain actually what I know is that
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
seven have closed in the last couple of
 
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.150 align:start position:0%
seven have closed in the last couple of
years

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
um those were all small businesses
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
Hattie's Place horseshoe Pines Freedom
 
00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:45.050 align:start position:0%
Hattie's Place horseshoe Pines Freedom
Manor

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
Manor
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
um it's it's been a steady role of
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
places not being able to make it
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
financially between trying to pay their
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
staff a living wage
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
um we raised our wage to 15 an hour in
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
November of 21 and thanks to a state
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
Grant we're able to maintain that
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
throughout this year and give our
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
employees a small you know Christmas
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
bonus that they really appreciated
 
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.610 align:start position:0%
bonus that they really appreciated
but

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
the 15 an hour in Sullivan County
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't get you an apartment on your own
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know if they're not a two income
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
family in New Hampshire they have a
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
problem with housing we have lost people
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
to South Carolina because of the housing
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
rates in here and pay the wage situation
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so we really really need to be able
 
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
to increase our wages increase our staff
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
right now we're running at nine beds
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
because adding two more people in which
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
we'd love to do puts us at a staffing
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
level that we can't support
 
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
um the 515 an hour would allow us to add
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
two more Medicaid beds would allow us to
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
add staff to
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
apply that support we do have people
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
that as mentioned shower
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
independently still drive their cars but
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
we also have people that are full help
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
they don't get their socks on by
 
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.829 align:start position:0%
they don't get their socks on by
themselves

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
we use both the underserved senior adult
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
population and we have mental health
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
members in our facility we used the
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
program that the state ran two years ago
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
for moving elderly patients from New
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Glencliff into
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate Assisted Living prop
 
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
population house homes so that they
 
00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
could have the least restrictive
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
environment one of them it's worked out
 
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
beautifully Another one not so much
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
but we're struggling along with her and
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
that bonus that was given to us and the
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
pay rate that was given to us for that
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
year were both godsends that program did
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
a great support for us it's over now and
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
we're back to trying to live on our
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
budget and 58.66 a day is a budget
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
number that
 
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
is really difficult to support
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um it is 74 by the way because they get
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
to keep but that's not enough to buy our
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
One smoker a carton of cigarettes on any
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
given month
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
um we end up supplementing his smoking
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
habit but you know we like to keep him
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
happy oops outside did we just testify
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
we encourage smoking in the elderly yeah
 
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
yeah he's been smoking for 60 years 60
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
years the chances of our breaking it
 
00:18:27.409 --> 00:18:27.419 align:start position:0%
aren't good we do get him routine chest
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
x-rays and make sure he's not doing any
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
damage so far so good he'll be 80 in a
 
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
damage so far so good he'll be 80 in a
year

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a point that we're
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
going to take away from him at this
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
point we because we're a small facility
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
we can individualize the person that
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
likes to go to museums can go to museums
 
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
the people that like to go to the Animal
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
Farm can go to the Animal Farm we want
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
to support their individual growth their
 
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living and their
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of life
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
excellent uh representative I'll take a
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
crack at answering your question I did
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
go over with representative Horgan to
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
um legislative research and I asked them
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
specifically how many 804 facilities we
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
have how many beds we have in it and I
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
asked them how many 805 facilities we
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
had and how many beds we had in it so
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the committee would be able to see the
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
difference in the type of facilities
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
that are out there but I think Ann did
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of saying we know of
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
seven facilities that have closed as a
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
result of the disparity in the payment
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
system from the state and if if they're
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
getting 95 a day I think we should get
 
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
20 more because we provide more services
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
do you have that number yeah uh the
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
research has not provided that to me yet
 
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
but I think we can have it by your work
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
Papa Vichy Mueller thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
I heard your testimony that basically
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
the you know lower reimbursement rate is
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
a continuous Financial challenge but you
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned a lot of closings during the
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
last couple of years and we are all very
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
aware of the huge impact that was added
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
by kovid and all those challenges
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
can you get us an idea of you know what
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
are those businesses that may have been
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
maybe barely viable without kovid and
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
kovid put them under or is this you know
 
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
have you seen stuff like this happening
 
00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
before kovit hit I I just need to you
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
know understand a little bit how to
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
separate those two if you can offer any
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
information to that I know it's a
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
complicated question it is complicated
 
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
and covet hasn't helped because it has
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
decreased our available Staffing and
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
that has been an ongoing problem for all
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
804s because they make less money they
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
pay less wages but covet wasn't
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily the death now of any of
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
those places aging out and not having
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
people to take over the business you
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
know the ownership aging out
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
um these were all small family-run
 
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:57.260 align:start position:0%
operations privately owned they weren't
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
conglomerates like some of the other
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
places some of the larger places are
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
they were small business owners and
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
without the support of the state they
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
were running on too thin and Edge to
 
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
survive covet and at the 58.60 cents
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
point mark
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's incredible I mean we are one of the
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
more reasonably priced assisted livings
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
in the area has told to me by members
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
that have been looking for housing we do
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
take patients with challenges that are
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
slightly Beyond 804 level of care in
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
only because we have staff capable of
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
supporting those members with their
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
mental health needs we do a lot of
 
00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.710 align:start position:0%
mental health needs we do a lot of
transportation

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
and most places don't they use the
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
transportation service companies which
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
our members aren't capable of doing on
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
their own I mean it's like putting your
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
mother in a taxi cab to Boston you
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
definitely not my late mother was in
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
Romania but no seriously I really want
 
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419 align:start position:0%
to thank you for a very insightful
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
answer and for sharing your perspective
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
I find it very very valuable because you
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
know I'm a freshman I'm learning a lot
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you for contributing to that
 
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.610 align:start position:0%
so thank you for contributing to that
thanks

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.970 align:start position:0%
 
Representatives

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
Stringham I want to make sure I
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
understand your bill as amended
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the as revised the special rate would
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
would apply only to 804 registered and
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
also be restricted to those who have a
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
greater than 50 percent uh Medicaid
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
occupancy so in your case if you have
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
you have I think 11 beds in um in your
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
facility if five or fewer of them were
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as proposed it would revert to
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
the existing rate
 
00:22:59.930 --> 00:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and just just to kind of get an idea
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
if if instead of uh providing this in
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
terms of an increased uh per diem rate
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
if it was just a straight Grant if
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
you're looking at uh uh six people a day
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
for it for a year and an extra 60 bucks
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
it's about a hundred and fifty thousand
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for year one facility
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
do those numbers are they in line with
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
um kind of what you're you're here
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
asking for today yes sir
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
um the 50 Mark is to try and encourage
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
additional Medicaid bed rates because
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid bed rate of some of the
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
privately owned facilities can be
 
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to zero they have a
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
choice they don't have to take
 
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
especially private facilities don't have
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
to take a Medicaid bed rate if they
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
don't have a bed available at the time
 
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
and I want to encourage those kind of
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
places the the
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
804 section of a larger Continuum home
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
first per se
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
to take that 50 of Medicaid bed rates
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
just to get
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
seniors that are living in homeless
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
shelters that comes always madly to mind
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
because we're taking someone from a
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter this week
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
um because the encouragement of and the
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for small business owners to
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
open more of these facilities is there
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
and is viable at 115 a night
 
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a crack at answering
 
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.049 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a crack at answering
that

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
um that is definitely the original
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill was that you'd have
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
this critical level I would submit to
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
the committee that if you're going to
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment that we're Reading
 
00:24:45.529 --> 00:24:45.539 align:start position:0%
Writing I did simplify it to just be an
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
804 facility the original reason I said
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
50 is because these bigger facilities
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
can have one or two Medicare beds and I
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know if there was a requirement
 
00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:57.419 align:start position:0%
for them to do that and they're able to
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
average that lower cost out over 100
 
00:25:03.289 --> 00:25:03.299 align:start position:0%
beds so originally the 50 was the idea
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
that if you're a small facility it's
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
kind of like if you're a private care
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
facility and you're charging nine
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month it's just a
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
different facility that's charging forty
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars a month it's just a
 
00:25:15.169 --> 00:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
different type of arrangement and that
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
social economic payment class usually
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't mix but I would say to you that
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
if you're going to narrow it with the
 
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I I believe the bill only
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
addressed 804 facilities because it said
 
00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:27.419 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities up to 16 Beds
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
which is definitionally what a NATO
 
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
force facility is so I don't think
 
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's any change in what the intent or
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
what we filed it just makes it clarify
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
that it's an 804 and in the amendment
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
the way we drafted it it left out the 50
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
stuff and again we live in this fluid
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
world so it's like what's better the 50
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
criteria or if you pay 804 facilities
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
that accept a Medicare bed and they said
 
00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
well I wasn't going to accept any but if
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
I get this right I'll accept one or two
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
or three I would say to you that that
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
might be better than the 50 criteria I
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't know which which would drive up
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
more beds and I would say to you that if
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
you limit it to 804 it eliminates the
 
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
huge fiscal impact and I would submit to
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
you that if you pass this bill that the
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is so minor it's not going
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
to throw off the whole state budget or
 
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps even be anything that we'd have
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
to really consider us a big issue in the
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
budget because it's limited to the 804
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
and then if it's limited to whether it's
 
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
one bed or fifty percent of the beds it
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make a big difference But to
 
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
answer your question five beds a year I
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
think that 150 number sounds about right
 
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
to what the impact would be on an
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
individual facility that had six
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
Medicare beds and that's the difference
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
between us you know losing 50 Grand a
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
year and maybe you know for the four
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
Partners oh my gosh they might make 20
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
grand for the the economic risk and what
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
we did this is not it is a money making
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
proposition and I believe in the
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
for-profit business but my sisters are
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
Saints they're Saints with what they do
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
um I was a landlord for 25 years I can't
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
imagine the level of care that they're
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
giving these individuals and I mean to
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
go up there and have a drunk 72 year old
 
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.490 align:start position:0%
go up there and have a drunk 72 year old
man

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
man
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
assaulting your sister
 
00:27:17.149 --> 00:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
and having to deal with that
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
we um would also like to mention that uh
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
my brother God bless them is using
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid interchangeably
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
this is a Medicaid Bill Medicare does
 
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
not cover 804 facilities at in any way
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
shape or form our clients do have
 
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
Medicare to pay for their doctor bills
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
the majority of them have Medicaid to
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
cover the cost that Medicare doesn't
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
cover but Medicare will not pay for 804.
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
but just it's interchangeable that's why
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
she's my older sister
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much good to see you
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
again good to see you that amendment
 
00:28:09.769 --> 00:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
should be automatically sent to the
 
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:12.419 align:start position:0%
committee from legislative Services
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
um so you should see that sometime today
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
all right I'll next call on uh Gary R
 
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
all right I'll next call on uh Gary R

Alex's New Hampshire archers lobbyist uh
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
committee I'm handing out a list of all
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
of the 804 and 805 facilities which is a
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
question that's come up uh we are here
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh in support of the bill however we
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
were not consulted or involved with the
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
drafting uh we represent New Hampshire
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
Arts which is the assisted living
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
facility Assisted Living Care Facility
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
Association in the state I did reach out
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor to try and coordinate I
 
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
wasn't terribly successful uh but right
 
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
now there are as you can see on the
 
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:34.980 align:start position:0%
final page of the spreadsheet that Mr
 
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:37.820 align:start position:0%
Ripple is handing out currently there's
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
6534 licensed beds for assisted living
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire 65 34.
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
that comes it's right on the Department
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services website we
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to house research it's
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's right there on the web for everyone
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
of those 65 34 beds only 500 of them are
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid beds and that information comes
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
from the Department dashboard that's
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
presented to the fiscal committee
 
00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
generally every fiscal committee meeting
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
so 606 6500 total beds 500 are Medicaid
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
beds eligible for reimbursement under
 
00:30:18.289 --> 00:30:18.299 align:start position:0%
the CFI program I know that you're
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
really behind on the uh the timing here
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
so Mr Cahoon is a former owner operator
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
of Friendship Manor
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
and New Ipswich he's an expert on
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
assisted living and the CFI program he
 
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
has Decades of experience so I'm just
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
going to suspend uh thank the sponsor
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
for bringing it forward but again we
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything to do with the
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
drafting or the coordination and I think
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
that might have uh solved some of the
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
issues that you've talked about this
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
morning and I just want to finally say
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
that I completely agree with
 
00:30:48.289 --> 00:30:48.299 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards we need to look
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
at all of the Medicaid rates we have
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
issues with DD substance abuse mental
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
health uh all of the Medicaid rates need
 
00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
to be looked at in in this budget not
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
just assisted living nursing homes
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
all of the providers are under an
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
immense Healthcare Workforce crisis
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels I I could go on so we
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
need to look at it in the budget process
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
so whether you retain this bill however
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
you want to go about it procedurally but
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
we need to look at all the Medicaid
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
rates going forward so I'll turn it over
 
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
to Mr Cahoon thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
thank you for the data you're welcome
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to address
 
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
you on House Bill 527.
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
um my wife and I own friendship manner
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
in New Ipswich New Hampshire for uh 37
 
00:31:33.179 --> 00:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
in New Ipswich New Hampshire for uh 37
years

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh we closed in May of 2022.
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
largely for Workforce issues okay I if
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
you to the extent that Workforce issues
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
were caused by code I suppose covet
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
might have been a factor but really it
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
was Workforce we simply could not hire
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
enough people to keep going
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
obviously part of a Workforce Solution
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
would be an increased rate allowing us
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
to pay a higher rate of pay to our
 
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.250 align:start position:0%
to pay a higher rate of pay to our
employees

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
it is I will admit it is only part of
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
the solution there are other demographic
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
reasons that the workforce is in trouble
 
00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
um but certainly making rates higher
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
would help
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
um before I continue I did hand out some
 
00:32:17.289 --> 00:32:17.299 align:start position:0%
written testimony there is a typo in it
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
in the last paragraph I talk about the
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
cost of building new facilities
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
and I it says 10 upwards of 10 million
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
dollars that actually should be 40
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
so that's a big typo yes all right
 
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.409 align:start position:0%
so that's a big typo yes all right
um

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:37.610 align:start position:0%
um
anyway

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
um there's no question that an increase
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
in rates is needed uh and essentially
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
for two reasons the first is that
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous unmet need
 
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
and the second reason would be
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to the unmet unmet need many
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
of you may be aware that the CFI budget
 
00:32:59.630 --> 00:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at that closely you're
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
somewhat misleading year after year CFI
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
does not expend all the money is
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated to it
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
and year after year they don't fill all
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
this authorized slots for clients that
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
are that are authorized
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
by agreement with the federal government
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
this leads some people to conclude that
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
this that the CFI need is therefore
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
being met that is not the case the
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
reason they can't expend the funds and
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
fill the slots is that the reimbursement
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
rates are so low that many providers
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
providers refuse to participate in the
 
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.330 align:start position:0%
providers refuse to participate in the
program

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
now CFI is the overall umbrella that
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
covers it's actually the the wafer that
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
covers Residential Care
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
with Residential Care the the situation
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
is actually a little bit more
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
complicated uh it's difficult to
 
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
determine what the unmet need in
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
residential care is compared to the
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
whole CFI program with a CFI program
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
we know how many units of service were
 
00:34:00.289 --> 00:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
authorized to fill the slots that are
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
that are open but we don't know how many
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
units excuse me and we do know how many
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
units were actually provided so the gap
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
between those two is at least one
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
indication of what the unmet need might
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
be unfortunately in residential care
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
Residential Care isn't authorized for a
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
client until the client finds a bed
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it's almost impossible to find a Bed
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
what what appears to be the case if you
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers is that virtually a
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the approved need for
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
residential care services is met but
 
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
that's only that's because of this
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
technical way in which that's it's it's
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh figured
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
um friendship manner is was an 804 home
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
um just to correct one thing that was
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
said before we were not a 16-bed home we
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
had 22 beds
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
804 homes are not limited to
 
00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.889 align:start position:0%
804 homes are not limited to
um

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
16 beds
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
many of the 804 homes were sheltered
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
care homes in the past and the sheltered
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
Care Homes are limited to 25 beds but
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
they were in fact shelter care homes
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
that were 100 beds
 
00:35:07.619 --> 00:35:08.450 align:start position:0%
that were 100 beds
um

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
now as as to cost avoidance when
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
friendship men are closed we were down
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
to 18 residents we had not admitted
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
residents for a couple of months because
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
we knew we might be closing so instead
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
of the 20 or 21 residents we normally
 
00:35:25.849 --> 00:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
had we had 18. of those 18 11 were moved
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
to nursing homes
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
of those 11. only one of them actually
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
needed a nursing home bed the other ten
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
went to nursing homes simply because we
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a CFI ResCare bed
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh in addition there were seven
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
residents who went to CFI beds
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
there are two problems with this the
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
first is that the Satan counties are
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
spending much more for a nursing home
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
bed than they would be for a sea of ibed
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
and secondly this means that at least 10
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
people were denied access to a nursing
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
home bed who badly needed one
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
so these are the reasons in a very brief
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
synopsis why the rates have to increase
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
there was a question about the number of
 
00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
homes that had closed obviously
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
Friendship Manor was one of those and
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller asked if there
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
were if homes were closing before the
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
covert epidemic and in fact there were I
 
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
testified in the budget hearings in 2018
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
about the closure of actually three
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
homes just before that budget process
 
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
Gaffney home in Rochester which had been
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
in business since 1902 and the carpenter
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
home in Swansea which was a town owned
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
home and had been in business since 1937
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
and the biggest reason that homes are
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
closing then and they're closing now is
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce homes for the most part have
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
not been able to hire sufficient staff
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
and that was certainly true of
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
friendship manner
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of limiting the
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
increase to 804 homes I would submit
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really make a lot of sense
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
uh there are in the list that
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
um Alex has handed out uh 136 licensed
 
00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.650 align:start position:0%
um Alex has handed out uh 136 licensed
homes

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
of those 136 licensed homes only 53 are
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
are enrolled as Medicaid CFI providers
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many of those 53 are
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
actually providing Services less than 53
 
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I know that a few
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
years ago this number was over 80 and
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
when there were 80 enrolled providers
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
about 40 were actively providing
 
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:33.380 align:start position:0%
services so
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh the 53 homes account for all of the
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
500 beds that are currently occupied but
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small portion of those
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
homes that are probably accounting for
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
most of them
 
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
um of the 53 homes and again this
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
statistic had to do with the original
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
version of the bill only 12. are they
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
the ones that are shaded
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
shaded is the Medicaid homes
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
that accept CFI Medicaid okay I guess
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
those are the 53 then thank you they're
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
53 shaded that's right okay
 
00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099 align:start position:0%
uh so it doesn't really make sense if we
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
if it's in the public interest uh and
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's good public policy to increase the
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
utilization of CFI beds and I believe
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
strongly that that is the case limiting
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
it to a very small number of the
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
providers doesn't really make a lot of
 
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.589 align:start position:0%
providers doesn't really make a lot of
sense

00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I also would submit that the 50
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
um required participation doesn't make
 
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.569 align:start position:0%
um required participation doesn't make
sense

00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
um of the
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
6534 licensed beds in the state
 
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.150 align:start position:0%
6534 licensed beds in the state
uh

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
5192 are in facilities of 50 beds or
 
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.890 align:start position:0%
5192 are in facilities of 50 beds or
greater

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:44.900 align:start position:0%
greater
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
most of those larger facilities are new
 
00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
our new facilities have been built in
 
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years or so
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
and as I said there was a typo in there
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
I talked about a cost of up to 10
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was a mistake it's
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
actually up to 40 million dollars
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
the majority of those homes if they were
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
50 medicated anything like the current
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate would go bankrupt within a
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
matter of six months to a year
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
the the larger newer homes simply cannot
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
participate fully as it were in the
 
00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program but what they can do
 
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
and which many of them would be willing
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
to do is to continue providing services
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
for people who were there but have run
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
out of money
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
Mrs Jones moved into
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
Happy Valley Assisted Living
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
six years ago with a couple hundred
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the bank she has now
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
spent that money
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
and right now unless the home is willing
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
to basically give her a free ride she's
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
probably going to be asked to go to a
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
nursing home which again might be a very
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
poor utilization of a nursing home bed
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
the homes would like to be able to allow
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
Mrs Jones to start to continue but they
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
need a somewhat higher rate of pay
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
actually considerably higher rate of pay
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
to do so they also need some statutory
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory changes
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
um but that's for another time
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I guess I would say is
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation yesterday
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh with a lady who was the largest CFI
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
residential care provider in the state
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
um she was talking about the increases
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
in costs in the last year how she's had
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
to increase her starting salary from
 
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
12.50 an hour to 16 an hour how food has
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
gone constantly up
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
she altogether has 72 beds three
 
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
facilities one of six two of 16 and one
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
of 40. and what she told me yesterday
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
was if the current Trend continues for
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
another year or so I will be getting out
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
of the business
 
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:47.220 align:start position:0%
and my 72 beds will go with me
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you for your
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
patience I would be happy to try any
 
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:56.300 align:start position:0%
all right I see at least three
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Miller then
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
questions this is more of a request
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
could we uh get this spreadsheets into
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
us in electronic Forum because honestly
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know working off paper is not that
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
effective and you know would appreciate
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
that absolutely I have it in Excel and
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to send it to you
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I we're going to
 
00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:26.579 align:start position:0%
have substantial conversations on all of
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
this on Medicaid day in division three I
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
invite you all to come in when that's on
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
the calendar uh and then I'm horrible at
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
your last name I know Alex is your first
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
name you you you started to hit multiple
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
different types of bed rates if you if
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
you could maybe maybe I already have
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
this information somewhere but if you if
 
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
you to the extent that you're aware of
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
varying bed rates what they are for how
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
much they are and when they went into
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
effect last uh I I'd appreciate having
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
division three use that as a reference
 
00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
document absolutely I will prepare that
 
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.450 align:start position:0%
document absolutely I will prepare that
and

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
presented to division three how can you
 
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
do that yeah all right thank you sir the
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
daily rate for uh Residential Care is
 
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
56.88 I I I I don't want to hear it I
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
want to I just wanted to make one one of
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
the comments there was a reference to a
 
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:26.180 align:start position:0%
95 rate which is oh you're talking
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
which is inaccurate there is no 805
 
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.349 align:start position:0%
which is inaccurate there is no 805
right

00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leishman for a
 
00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:36.890 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leishman for a
question

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and hope
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
this question is easy uh are most of
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
these facilities tax exempt or not for
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
profit I have no idea what between the
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
difference between 805 or 804 at least
 
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
that to my colleagues on division three
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
but I just curious
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
many of them are organized as
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
not-for-profits but not all of them the
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
smaller homes tend to be for-profit not
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
that they make one uh Friendship Manor
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
was a C Corp
 
00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:04.849 align:start position:0%
was a C Corp
um

00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
technically for profit but again we
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
didn't make one my wife and I can were
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
able to do that for 37 years because we
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
didn't depend upon it to live one of us
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
always worked outside of the manner to
 
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.460 align:start position:0%
basically support our family
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Mr
 
00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:21.109 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Mr
chairman

00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
members representative McGuire
 
00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm also not very familiar
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
with this is so there are some assisted
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
living in the state that are not on this
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
list for example my County I think has
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living no I'm sorry what I
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
think my county has an assisted living
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
facility is that right and some
 
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
Communists have assisted livings yes
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
there are three or four
 
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
is that it everything else that's
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
private everything that's private would
 
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
be on this list is that yeah
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
um assisted living is not a licensure
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
term the licensure term is is
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
Residential Care
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
um there is in RSA 161-j a stipulation
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
that someone who advertises as an
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
assisted living home must be licensed
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
but there is no Assisted Living license
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
so assisted living homes are licensed as
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
resident either residential care which
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
is 804 or supported residential care
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is 805.
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
may I follow it thank you a follow-up I
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
was going to mention there were two on
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
here that I recognize one I was on the
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
board of for a while that was run by the
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
Masons and the Masons supported it and
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
the one in Rockingham County the county
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
supports it so some of these are
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
supported by others than just the money
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's coming in thank you yeah I looked
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
for my county and I didn't see it so
 
00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.390 align:start position:0%
for my county and I didn't see it so
anyway

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the basic difference
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
between 804 and 805 is it simply 16 beds
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
or more no 15 or less no okay but it has
 
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with bed size it has
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
to do with the the level supposedly with
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
the Acuity of the population served in
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
other words
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
how sick are they how impaired are they
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
what do they need in terms of nursing
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
Services it is a very very on
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in both law and
 
00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
regulation though
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overlap in other words
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
okay one more thank you
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal note implies that
 
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
um 804s get get a one rate and 805s get
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
a different rate but you said that's
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
incorrect that's incorrect there are
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
there are two Acuity based rates which
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
came out of a pilot program and I
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
believe was in 2002.
 
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.829 align:start position:0%
believe was in 2002.
okay

00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it was they were intended largely for
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
memory care or Alzheimer's care
 
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
uh the pilot program was more or less
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
successful there were three homes that
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
participated in it one of which no
 
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
longer does
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
the pilot program was continued So
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
currently there are two homes that
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
receive those rates but only two homes
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
they are both 805s but it's not an 805
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
rate one of the things our association
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
recently requested was could we
 
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
go back to that concept go back to the
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
successful pirate pilot and have Acuity
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
based rates in other words open these
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
rates up to something more than two
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
homes out of 136. and that rate's about
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars there are two rates one
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
is about 85 the other's about 95. okay
 
00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
are the questions from committee members
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
all right seeing uh now we'll hear the
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
from the counties and Kate Horgan from
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
counties

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Kate
 
00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
Horgan I represent the New Hampshire
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
Association of counties which is all of
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
you are elected and appointed officials
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
at County government level the
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
association does not have a formal
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but to answer
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's question there
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
are three counties that also have an
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility they are
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Merrimack and Cheshire county
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
um the association would ask that if you
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
are to consider this to please do it for
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
all rates doing it for a small subset
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense all facilities are
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
facing Workforce shortages small margins
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
all of you are members of your county
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
delegations you know your nursing homes
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
operated a deficit every single year so
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
we would just ask that you if you're
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
going to increasing rates you increase
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
them for everyone and not a small subset
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that the
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming what is
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
the total number of beds in these three
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
facilities uh I would have to get back
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
to you on that representative McGuire
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly get that number for
 
00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.849 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly get that number for
you

00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you
 
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question do
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what the waiting list
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
is Statewide for nursing homes I can Mt
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
nursing homes thank you for the question
 
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
representative I can speak to the
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
counties uh for the nursing homes uh I
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
would the average is over a hundred
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
people for every single County right now
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
some counties are have more I know
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county for example I think is
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
at 120 right now and they just had to
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
close an entire Wing because they cannot
 
00:48:36.609 --> 00:48:36.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:38.819 --> 00:48:39.890 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.450 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I had a meeting with Jason Smith
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
who's managing the Rockingham County
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
homes and uh
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we talked about were
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
exactly those challenges about you know
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
the rage being so low it makes it really
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
hard for them to be able to pay the
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
wages that would allow them to retain
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
the staff and that's where all the
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
workforce but you know issues are
 
00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.530 align:start position:0%
workforce but you know issues are
starting

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
starting
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
does your Association have you know its
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
own guideline I mean this this is a bill
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
proposed but do you have any uh
 
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
you know broad position from your
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
associations in terms of what the rate
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
should be and if so could you provide
 
00:49:20.089 --> 00:49:20.099 align:start position:0%
that those suggestions to us we do not
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
we are actually working on that Senator
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald actually has a bill that would
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
raise all Medicaid rates uh for all all
 
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates across the board and we
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
are in the process of figuring out what
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
those numbers should be I believe it's
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much we will
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on Senate on House
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 527 and is there a list
 
00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
yep it's coming
 
00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:09.060 align:start position:0%
oh we got one person wants to speak
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chairman my name is
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
Rob Berry I'm with the Department of
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I thought I
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card apparently didn't
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
get to you I apologize for that
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
um to my right I have Miss Christie Roy
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
and she can explain what she does for
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm Christy Roy and for the Department I
 
00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:35.579 align:start position:0%
work in the rate setting area for DHHS
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to just provide a little
 
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
bit of information prior to the work
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
session we don't have a formal position
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
on this bill either but we did want to
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
give a little insight as to how we got
 
00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:49.579 align:start position:0%
to our fiscal analysis so the department
 
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:52.380 align:start position:0%
does not believe it's permissible to
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
Target rates as is contemplated by this
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
legislation that being the size of a
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
facility and the Medicaid utilization
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
rate we base our rates on the Acuity
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
level of individuals within the assisted
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
living facilities so we have currently
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
three different rates the lowest one
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
being the 58 and change in the highest
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
one being somewhere around it's 95 41
 
00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.950 align:start position:0%
one being somewhere around it's 95 41
41.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
41.
 
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:21.740 align:start position:0%
um so we're happy to work last one again
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
95 41 so there are two dementia level
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
rates so there's the standard
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
Residential Care rate for CFI which is
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
or choice for Independence which is the
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
56.88 the second rate is dementia level
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
one which is 84.74 and the third rate is
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
for dementia care level two which is
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
95.41 they're service based rates we
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
don't have a facility specific rate
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
model for this so that's where the
 
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
challenge comes in
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
um it's a service level rate so that's
 
00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
where the Acuity would be it's
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
additional Acuity Services needed for
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
those additional dementia levels
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards then
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I think hey thank
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
you to the department for coming to this
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
I uh I look forward to doing a deep dive
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
on all of this in in uh in division
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
three and you heard me ask Alex a little
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
while ago if he's got a sheet on all the
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
different categories of uh bed rates and
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
when they were established and how much
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
they are I I think if we had a
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
comprehensive document to look at that
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
would help us go through and figure out
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
what we want to do to the big picture
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
and not just one-offs sure and now we're
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
trying to also have something from
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
licensing uh come to the work session as
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
well to explain the differences between
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
hee 804 and 805 if that would help the
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee as well all right and you know
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
the way that works Mr Ripple schedules
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
with Nathan white and then you guys get
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
alerted okay all right thank you
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
coming so we heard earlier that um a
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
total of 535 beds are receiving these
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
rate these three rates I guess is that
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
true or is there there more that's
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
likely go ahead the for so for State
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 the total days that I had
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
pulled from our mmis system which is our
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
was just under 200 000.
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
representative Prophet popovichi Mueller
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
being here and answering questions I
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
mean you've been here when we were
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony about the impact
 
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the uh you know lower rates uh to you
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
know the ability of the centers to
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
provide service obviously that testimony
 
00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:54.059 align:start position:0%
is you know narrow in the sense that it
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
reflects their experience for you as the
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
department could you provide any color
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
or information to us in terms of whether
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
the current rates allow for the centers
 
00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
to sustainably operate or is there a
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
concern at the department level over
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
these Trends I just would like to hear
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on this
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
I believe we'd have to get back to you
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
on that we have to speak to some people
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
at the department to get their views on
 
00:54:18.119 --> 00:54:18.770 align:start position:0%
at the department to get their views on
it

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
um that's more of a finance three
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
question anyway but I thought while we
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
were here you know if you could share
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
being here uh has these closings around
 
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:37.980 align:start position:0%
the state has that put you know
 
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
additional uh pressure on these you know
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
on finding beds
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to that personally
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
um I will try to get something from
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
licensing here but I can say that I
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
would expect that that would put
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
additional pressure on
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
um on facilities and individuals who are
 
00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
um uh the rates on
 
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.390 align:start position:0%
um uh the rates on
um

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the the rates paid
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
vary by the Acuity is there anything in
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
the fee schedule that incorporates
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
things like local wage index Indigent
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
care factors or Capital issues or
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
anything that would affect that and
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
could you also comment on what you what
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
restricts you from incorporating a
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
percent Medicaid as a factor in setting
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
the rate
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to differ to Christy in that
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so again it's a service-based rate
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
they were increased five percent from
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 in July they're a CFI rates so any
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
other CFI legislation would also affect
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
this rate
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
um in the rate methodology that was
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
determined I when it was set there it
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
was out there was an outsourced company
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
I believe that worked with the
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
Department to come up with those
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
original rates and then my understanding
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
in the waivers there's uh information
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
about updating annually based on the CMS
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
Market Basket for CFI rates and then
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
they are additionally
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
held to a budget adjustment factor or a
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
budget neutrality Factor so there's
 
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
plenty of complexities in that rate
 
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.309 align:start position:0%
plenty of complexities in that rate
methodology

00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
how many facilities uh have have waivers
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
on on the base rate uh I thought you
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
said some do
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
waivers on the base rate meaning the
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
waiver so they have an adjustment
 
00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.010 align:start position:0%
waiver so they have an adjustment
so

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
um the adjustment is service level based
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
so it would depend on the qualifications
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
within that service or the the need of
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
this what's required for the service
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a facility specific adjustment
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
so if there are only two facilities that
 
00:57:11.569 --> 00:57:11.579 align:start position:0%
would provide that additional level of
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
service or that additional level of care
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
and what's required for that additional
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
level care there are two facilities but
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's no limitation to the quantity of
 
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
facilities that could provide that
 
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
additional level of care if they so
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
choose they just have to I would assume
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
apply for and prove that that's the
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
additional level of care they're
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
providing for that service
 
00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.230 align:start position:0%
providing for that service
foreign

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this could just be a
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
really short answer uh the five percent
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned in hb2 it's my
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
understanding that that expires at the
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
end of this hb2 period and and rolls
 
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
back to the previous level unless
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
reauthorized in the next hb2 or or or is
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
that was that a permanent increase to
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
the Baseline
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's permanent about
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
I can we can look into that for you yeah
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:14.089 --> 00:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
historically adjustments to rates when
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
you're reducing it you have to prove
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not affecting access to care
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid so if there is an
 
00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
adjustment to that rate a decrease it
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
would be a significant lift to prove
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
access to care especially with what
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none we did find your card sorry
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
we lost it that's all right
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
but anybody else that wishes to make
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 527
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have on the blue sheet
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
just the two Campbells that have signed
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
in and and pro both Ann Campbell and
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
 Campbell uh no other signatures on
 
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.370 align:start position:0%
 Campbell uh no other signatures on
there

00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you all I'm going to close this
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 527. you'll be
 
00:59:03.049 --> 00:59:03.059 align:start position:0%
hearing more from division three when it
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
will be scheduled for probably
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
continued on with all the other Medicaid
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
rate discussion
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your testimony thank
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
you all for coming
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
I'll close this hearing
 
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to open division
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
three uh where I'm going to meet
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
immediately put us into recess uh until
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh say 12 35 so that should give people
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
time to go get something to eat and come
 
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
back we'll be in here at 12 35 to deal
 
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:03.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
all right uh we were supposed to start
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
at 12 35 it's uh 12 50 15 minutes late
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's on me uh we're out of recess
 
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh we're uh here in a division three
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
work session
 
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
um on the calendar is to discuss House
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 that we've had in division three
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
for a little while House Bill 527 that
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
we just uh talked about in full Finance
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
today and could talk about it a little
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
bit today and the uh the star traction
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
of today is uh is sb1
 
01:40:40.679 --> 01:40:42.410 align:start position:0%
of today is uh is sb1
so

01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.850 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with
 
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:50.810 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with
um

01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
I think I think to get a sense of where
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
we're at uh I I'd like to get a straw
 
01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:01.460 align:start position:0%
vote uh I have been a supporter of sb1
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
from the beginning we're going to take
 
01:41:10.129 --> 01:41:10.139 align:start position:0%
that up first I think sb1 and uh and I I
 
01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
would like us I would like everyone to
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
tell us through a straw vote where they
 
01:41:19.850 --> 01:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
think they are on sb1 and then we can
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
talk about an amendment to sb1 that's
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
the same thing as the amendment to 49.
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
so so those conversations will converge
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
but to establish a baseline I think we
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that there's absolute
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
Clarity on where people are with sb1 so
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I would I would take a motion to
 
01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:42.890 align:start position:0%
so I would I would take a motion to
um

01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
know where it's going to be it's not a
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
real vote I'm taking a straw I want to
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
make sure I know where people are at I
 
01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
think I think the public needs to know
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
where people are at on this
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr chairman subject to our
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
conversations of yesterday it seems like
 
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
we're formulating a good Amendment so I
 
01:42:04.729 --> 01:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
would make the motion to ought to pass
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill one okay is there a
 
01:42:07.139 --> 01:42:08.450 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill one okay is there a
second

01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
second okay
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
um so uh is there the discussion on this
 
01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
is that the Senate passed sb1 24 to
 
01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:23.410 align:start position:0%
is that the Senate passed sb1 24 to
nothing

01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:23.420 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
this was an enormous high water mark in
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
the past decade where people have often
 
01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
said that we needed to do something to
 
01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
replace the sununu center and the desire
 
01:42:38.290 --> 01:42:38.300 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
reached kind of a a boiling point two
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
years ago when the legislature
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
passed into law the closure of the
 
01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
sununu center on one March of this year
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
that's just a few weeks from now
 
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature had an opportunity to
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
pass a committee conference report and
 
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:03.020 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
the reason the committee conference
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
report failed it was really I think
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
predominantly a burnt round capacity
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
there was there were different views on
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
what the capacity ought to be there was
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
a position that went with the house
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
representatives of six the senate had a
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
vision of 12 with a flexibility of up to
 
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.390 align:start position:0%
vision of 12 with a flexibility of up to
18

01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
and when that topic came up the
 
01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
conversations broke down and the
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
committee conference uh
 
01:43:40.010 --> 01:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
broke up and didn't didn't complete any
 
01:43:40.020 --> 01:43:40.850 align:start position:0%
broke up and didn't didn't complete any
work

01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
so here we are nobody introduced
 
01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
anything last year to fix this problem
 
01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
we creep into this year
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
now about to begin our budget cycle with
 
01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:54.500 align:start position:0%
the sununu Center closing in a few days
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the legislature still has not acted
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
so sb1 is half of the legislature acting
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
strongly and convincingly with a 24 to
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
nothing vote
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard to beat 24 to nothing in the
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
Senate that bill came over to the house
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
for us to consider the house has looked
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
at this issue in multiple different ways
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
children and family law saw a similar
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill with House Bill 120 in which
 
01:44:27.609 --> 01:44:27.619 align:start position:0%
division three was invited to that
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
then we had House Bill 49 where we've
 
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
gone through a lot of discussion deep in
 
01:44:37.370 --> 01:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
discussion on amendments it started with
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
the Waller Amendment and then division
 
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
three came to a significant agreement
 
01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
yesterday and and so we've got that and
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we are on the cusp of success in
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
doing our job and and so what I think a
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
vote on sb1 will do
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
will be to bring us to concur with all
 
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
of the hard work of the Senate that's
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
been done and supported by the
 
01:45:06.719 --> 01:45:07.609 align:start position:0%
been done and supported by the
department

01:45:07.609 --> 01:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's been done and supported by the
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
advocacy group and the public that's
 
01:45:17.209 --> 01:45:17.219 align:start position:0%
been done and supported and we have a
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
letter from the governor
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
so out of respect for all of those
 
01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:22.490 align:start position:0%
so out of respect for all of those
people

01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:45:25.209 --> 01:45:25.219 align:start position:0%
that have looked at this and have
 
01:45:28.129 --> 01:45:28.139 align:start position:0%
delivered us sb1
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
I would like us to vote do we think yes
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
or no we can support sb1 or not so this
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
is not a formal vote this is a sense of
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative hole
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
um I think yesterday in division three
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
we had a very productive session
 
01:45:56.530 --> 01:45:56.540 align:start position:0%
um talked about a a number of things
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
somehow along the way we ended up with
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
this deadline of March 1st
 
01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
that in some ways is an artificially
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
driven deadline by prior law
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's not like the building stops working
 
01:46:12.729 --> 01:46:12.739 align:start position:0%
on on March 2nd
 
01:46:12.739 --> 01:46:14.629 align:start position:0%
on on March 2nd
the

01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
the goal of of kind of figuring out what
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
you want to do before you go do it is an
 
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
important thing to me as an engineer and
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
what I see now is we're trying to create
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and spend money but we haven't defined
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
the location or what the facility is
 
01:46:29.689 --> 01:46:29.699 align:start position:0%
before we even get there and we're
 
01:46:32.209 --> 01:46:32.219 align:start position:0%
saying go spend right 15 million dollars
 
01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:33.830 align:start position:0%
saying go spend right 15 million dollars
so

01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:34.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh hearing what you said there's a lot
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
of people that say this is a good idea
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
and it did pass out of the Senate 24-0
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
but I think we're not quite ready there
 
01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.570 align:start position:0%
but I think we're not quite ready there
so

01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
um as amended by the Senate and passed
 
01:46:52.609 --> 01:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay I I I respect your conclusion I
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
just I just want to bring some facts
 
01:47:00.169 --> 01:47:00.179 align:start position:0%
that we've heard in testimony and that
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
that the we heard that the 15 million
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
dollars that found its home in sb1 was
 
01:47:07.609 --> 01:47:07.619 align:start position:0%
the original estimate
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
um that we that came about as a result
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
of there being a special committee on
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
the sununu replacement Center uh and
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
that what we have experienced in the
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
past year or so of of delay is a very
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
strong inflationary problem with with
 
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues and that and that
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
delay in this case probably contributed
 
01:47:32.209 --> 01:47:32.219 align:start position:0%
from going from a 15 million dollar
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
estimate to a 21.6 million dollar
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
estimate and I don't know what another
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
delay would do if if this is still a
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
good idea at the end of the day does it
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
become a 25 million dollar good idea or
 
01:47:47.090 --> 01:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
not I I I do think we've been given some
 
01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
some numbers and I can understand that
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
we've had bizarre inflation and the
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
United States over the last two years so
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that that attributes the distinction
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
between the 15 and the 21.6 I'm not I'm
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
not saying that to change your mind I'm
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
just making sure that the record's
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
complete thank you um
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
so I agree and this goes back to I think
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday in our committee or
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
division we had a a great work session
 
01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
to work out some of these issues
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to bring come to page four
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
lines 30 and 31.
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
quote in no event shall the total
 
01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:28.139 align:start position:0%
expenditures from all sources for the
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
design and construction of the new
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
secured Youth Development facility
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
exceed 15 million dollars end quote
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
right that is in severe conflict right
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that bill was drafted this year
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about something from
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
two years ago the Senate could have
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
in their in their due diligence put in a
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
number that was more representative of
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of a facility
 
01:48:52.729 --> 01:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
that's on top of where is it and whether
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
it's for 6 to 12 or 12 to 18 and I think
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
our amendment that was proposed
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday to start looking at some of
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
those issues was critical that's why I'm
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
having trouble with what was passed out
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the Senate
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
Stringham you have anything to add to
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
um well I'm against sb1 as written given
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh our lengthy discussions yesterday and
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh the direction we were taking things
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative Weiler
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
we have to pass something we're two
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
years behind there's a date coming up
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
within days
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
we can't just say we're going to kill
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
this and start over again there isn't
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
enough time next week we're going to get
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
the budget and we're going to be buried
 
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
in it we got to do something now today
 
01:49:43.729 --> 01:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
to move this along if we pass sb1 even
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
if this thing's in it you don't like the
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
most important thing in it we've moved
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
the date out
 
01:49:51.410 --> 01:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
then when we get to the spending and the
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
be able to adjust that within the budget
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
process and put it in hb2 if need be any
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
amendments to it that we decide needs to
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
be in there but we've got to pass
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
something to move the date away from
 
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
March 1st so I I wasn't clear I I'm PR
 
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
this is probably not exactly the way the
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
parliamentarian would run this but we're
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
talking about sb1 I still intend to have
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
us discuss the Division III amendment
 
01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
that we came to agreement on last night
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
so so so I I want to see where we are on
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
sb1 before we begin to entertain The
 
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
Division III Amendment and to find out
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
if anyone else has brought an amendment
 
01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
forward for us so
 
01:50:42.290 --> 01:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh representative
 
01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:44.330 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh representative
Wallner

01:50:44.330 --> 01:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
I would I would not
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
um support Senate bill one as it's uh
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
before us right now I would um take a
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
look I want to take a look at
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
um amendments to it and um I'm really
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that we still do not know the
 
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
location of this facility and I think
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the first things we
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
need to do is try to figure out where it
 
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
and work with the communities and then
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
move forward from there and I think in
 
01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:16.679 align:start position:0%
the budget is the place that we need to
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
be looking at the financial aspects of
 
01:51:23.090 --> 01:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
this I would I would support
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the department has testified number
 
01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
of times that they need additional funds
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
to get through this biennium and I would
 
01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:32.270 align:start position:0%
to get through this biennium and I would
support

01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:32.810 align:start position:0%
support
um

01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
allocation of additional funds for them
 
01:51:38.090 --> 01:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that discussion
 
01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:40.609 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that discussion
representative

01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:45.060 align:start position:0%
um sb1 is written I think as a division
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've pinpointed some problems with and
 
01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
i would support discussion of the
 
01:51:51.649 --> 01:51:51.659 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we have reviewed in the
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
past few days
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative norgren
 
01:52:00.169 --> 01:52:00.179 align:start position:0%
I agree with Mary Jane and Laura
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.530 --> 01:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh certainly we did spend a great
 
01:52:08.990 --> 01:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
session as representative hole said on
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
amending it so I think to move forward I
 
01:52:15.169 --> 01:52:15.179 align:start position:0%
would suggest voting ought to pass on
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
the bill and then take up the Amendments
 
01:52:20.330 --> 01:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we just took a
 
01:52:24.590 --> 01:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
straw vote while we got the discussion I
 
01:52:30.850 --> 01:52:30.860 align:start position:0%
I recorded in my head is three yay OTP 5
 
01:52:35.629 --> 01:52:35.639 align:start position:0%
nay on passing sb1 or recommending a
 
01:52:37.850 --> 01:52:37.860 align:start position:0%
passage out of division three does
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
anyone want to have me go around and do
 
01:52:42.649 --> 01:52:42.659 align:start position:0%
a more formal Vote or would you accept
 
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
that it's probably three five
 
01:52:49.250 --> 01:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
oh okay so
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you let's transition uh Mr
 
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
Ripple have have you laid out the the
 
01:52:57.169 --> 01:52:57.179 align:start position:0%
current amendment that we worked on last
 
01:52:57.179 --> 01:52:58.490 align:start position:0%
current amendment that we worked on last
night

01:52:58.490 --> 01:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
actually there was another change Dinky
 
01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
Dinky little typo
 
01:53:10.129 --> 01:53:10.139 align:start position:0%
that uh that has since been fixed since
 
01:53:10.139 --> 01:53:10.970 align:start position:0%
that uh that has since been fixed since
you

01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman was the issue of Quorum
 
01:53:20.689 --> 01:53:20.699 align:start position:0%
addressed in that typo
 
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
there was a question raised regarding
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
yeah we can talk about that but but the
 
01:53:27.490 --> 01:53:27.500 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes we we we we we we
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
changed the numbers of representatives
 
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
from the local community from three to
 
01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:35.699 align:start position:0%
just being representatives to let the
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
commission find its right size and then
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
without a clear number of how many would
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
be on the commission we we made it a
 
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
majority of those appointed to the
 
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
commission so so I think that resolved
 
01:53:51.970 --> 01:53:51.980 align:start position:0%
that issue and what we just talked about
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
is on we're jumping around a little bit
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
but since you brought it up on page two
 
01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.290 align:start position:0%
but since you brought it up on page two
line

01:54:00.290 --> 01:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
15 and line 16 a version that you saw
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
last night said three representatives
 
01:54:09.770 --> 01:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
and instead of saying three
 
01:54:12.129 --> 01:54:12.139 align:start position:0%
Representatives we made it generically
 
01:54:15.709 --> 01:54:15.719 align:start position:0%
representatives and and that was so that
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
we didn't waste motion we've we've heard
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
that there are three potential places we
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
could go
 
01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
one of them doesn't sound like a it's
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
going to pass the common sense test so
 
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
why delay the commission looking for
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
somebody to sit on the board that's
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
irrelevant so so that's that's what that
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's why that got changed and then the
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
other little typo
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
from what you saw last night is on line
 
01:54:45.480 --> 01:54:47.090 align:start position:0%
from what you saw last night is on line
34.

01:54:47.090 --> 01:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
34.
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
relative to a commission
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
to study Community impacts uh that that
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
phrase is consistent with the way we
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
describe the commission and the
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
amendment and and last night had the
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
previous title committee to study Public
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
Safety so it's just internally making
 
01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:08.219 align:start position:0%
the document internally compatible
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
there's no change
 
01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.930 align:start position:0%
there's no change
so

01:55:11.930 --> 01:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:12.649 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at Amendment zero four
 
01:55:20.169 --> 01:55:20.179 align:start position:0%
five four Hotel
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
it basically on step nine I think we're
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
unanimous that we want
 
01:55:30.890 --> 01:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
um the the repeal of the closure date
 
01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:31.729 align:start position:0%
um the the repeal of the closure date
um

01:55:31.729 --> 01:55:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:34.850 --> 01:55:34.860 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard any disagreement today
 
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
about the appropriation of 1.5 million
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
dollars so that they can continue
 
01:55:43.010 --> 01:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
operations through the balance of the
 
01:55:44.689 --> 01:55:44.699 align:start position:0%
year that's four months of operating
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
expense anything that they don't spend
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
would end up getting lapsed back anyways
 
01:55:55.250 --> 01:55:55.260 align:start position:0%
so is there any discussion or we are we
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay everyone's okay with that
 
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.550 align:start position:0%
okay everyone's okay with that
appropriation

01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're down to line 15. uh
 
01:56:06.169 --> 01:56:06.179 align:start position:0%
there's now some contention on what was
 
01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh birthed in the walner amendment which
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
was uh putting aside the sum of two
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh so that they could
 
01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
begin the department could begin to
 
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
acquire services for site evaluation
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
everyone says we need site evaluation so
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
there's site evaluation in that two
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars architect consultation
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
and development of design options for
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
any replacement facility we went on to
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
say that we want two options considered
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
we want an option for six to twelve and
 
01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
we wanted an option of 12 to 18. so
 
01:56:46.189 --> 01:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's in this version of
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment that didn't come in
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
initially but we added it in our
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
conversations and agreements last night
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
um Department shall present its
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
recommended site for the facility no
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
later than the 30th of September I know
 
01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of pressure to do it
 
01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:04.980 align:start position:0%
sooner than that I think if we just
 
01:57:07.729 --> 01:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
listen to what's in the wind it's
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
already been determined where it's
 
01:57:12.490 --> 01:57:12.500 align:start position:0%
probably going to be and
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I I I I don't understand that
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
being as contentious as it has become
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
But but so be it
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
line 22 the appropriation contained in
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
the section shall not lapse in June of
 
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
25 this is different than the operations
 
01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
money this is the
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
architect money and then the governor
 
01:57:40.129 --> 01:57:40.139 align:start position:0%
can draw a warrant
 
01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
so that is what is in line 15. the first
 
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
things first
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
is this consistent with what you think
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
we said last night this is a different
 
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
question than whether or not you still
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
support it today the first thing is is
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
this accurate
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
is anyone disputing the accuracy of what
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
we did
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:11.460 align:start position:0%
um I I will say that I support
 
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
this from the walner amendment because
 
01:58:16.910 --> 01:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
it makes sense you you on a critical
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
path we want a new facility so that we
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
can transition to a fully therapeutic
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
model that's in the benefit of best
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
interests of the kids best interests of
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
and on the critical path
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
these Services site selection
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
is kind of the first step and I'm
 
01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:41.820 align:start position:0%
hearing people say we got to do side
 
01:58:44.209 --> 01:58:44.219 align:start position:0%
evaluation but we don't need to
 
01:58:45.649 --> 01:58:45.659 align:start position:0%
appropriate the money to do site
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
evaluation we just need to do site
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
evaluation and so this is a do Loop in
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
the software world that just has me
 
01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:53.870 align:start position:0%
the software world that just has me
boggled

01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
boggled
 
01:58:57.169 --> 01:58:57.179 align:start position:0%
so this is this is let's one step at a
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
time let's go do the side evaluation
 
01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
let's go appropriate the money
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
so that was my discussion of lines 25
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
through 31.
 
01:59:10.250 --> 01:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
are there other points of view we'd love
 
01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
to hear other points of view
 
01:59:14.109 --> 01:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
well when I got home last night and
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I started reading this
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
I always went back to it feels like
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
we're putting the cart
 
01:59:31.129 --> 01:59:31.139 align:start position:0%
maybe the whole train before the horse
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
it's just we need I think someone needs
 
01:59:39.229 --> 01:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
to make a decision about the site
 
01:59:42.410 --> 01:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the best ways to make
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
that decision is for the Department to
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
say where they think they would be
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
most in favor of being co-located
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
because they
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
say that there's a lot of there's a lot
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
of efficiencies there's a lot of things
 
02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
to be gained by one site over another
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
and so I think that would be the first
 
02:00:03.599 --> 02:00:04.609 align:start position:0%
and so I think that would be the first
thing

02:00:04.609 --> 02:00:04.619 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen is deciding where
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be and then the next part
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
of that is working with the commission
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
around that which is made up of people
 
02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
from the the communities
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
and start working with them around
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
um the kinds of things that you think
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
the community needs to have available
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
needs to know about the um about the
 
02:00:35.890 --> 02:00:35.900 align:start position:0%
program before we move into
 
02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:38.780 align:start position:0%
architectural drawings
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
design all of those other things let's
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
decide where it is the sooner we do that
 
02:00:47.689 --> 02:00:47.699 align:start position:0%
I think the better equipped we will be
 
02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
to move forward and I also think that a
 
02:00:52.729 --> 02:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
lot of this is really budget work
 
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
because there are
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
um still
 
02:00:58.729 --> 02:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
sums of money that need to be
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the budget
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
so so the clerk for clarification would
 
02:01:06.770 --> 02:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
you strike that entire paragraph or
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
would you perhaps reduce the amount of
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
money appropriated and limit the work
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
simply to site evaluation because we've
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
not technically done a site evaluation
 
02:01:20.030 --> 02:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
which is the normal first step in
 
02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
project management before you select a
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
site so so would you
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
preserve the paragraph and limit it so
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
that we put some money into site
 
02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.990 align:start position:0%
that we put some money into site
selection

02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
selection
 
02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
what I would do is I would direct the
 
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
department to make the best choice from
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
programmatic reasons
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
which site they prefer
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that would necessarily
 
02:01:47.699 --> 02:01:49.070 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that would necessarily
need

02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
financial support
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
if they were do that today would that be
 
02:01:58.850 --> 02:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
dispositive in your view I mean it seems
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
to me like we would need something
 
02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
formal from the commissioner or somebody
 
02:02:05.089 --> 02:02:05.099 align:start position:0%
we I think we already know they want
 
02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hamstead everyone wants Hampstead and
 
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
but the problem is if you live in
 
02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:10.750 align:start position:0%
but the problem is if you live in
Hampstead

02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampstead
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
you have not been respected yet we
 
02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:16.739 align:start position:0%
haven't gone to Hampstead to say hey
 
02:02:19.129 --> 02:02:19.139 align:start position:0%
this is what we're thinking what what's
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
it going to involve well so what what
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is say okay here's
 
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
some money here's the commission go
 
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:29.820 align:start position:0%
forward and start working with the
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
various communities we we can't show up
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
and say in my view we've already decided
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in Hampstead now you
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
tell us why that's not a good idea
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the way this should
 
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:44.580 align:start position:0%
work this should be us coming to them
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
saying hey look we're looking at three
 
02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and and this one's got
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
these advantages these ones got those
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
disadvant advantages and You by God you
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
are just right you know uh so so I I
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
think I think you're asking we keep
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
talking about process I think you your
 
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
approach breaks a normal process we
 
02:03:11.629 --> 02:03:11.639 align:start position:0%
should do site evaluation and work
 
02:03:13.870 --> 02:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully with the three communities
 
02:03:18.649 --> 02:03:18.659 align:start position:0%
before we stick a pin in the na in the
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
map and say this is where it shall be
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
deal with it which which is my really
 
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
rough translation of what I'm hearing
 
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
you say representative and I apologize
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
it was that was rude I don't mean it to
 
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
be rude uh after two years I'm getting a
 
02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
this I would have the department this is
 
02:03:45.609 --> 02:03:45.619 align:start position:0%
me talking I would have the department
 
02:03:49.370 --> 02:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
say where it is they feel is the best
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
location for this facility
 
02:03:55.729 --> 02:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
from a standpoint of what
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
is going to meet the needs of the kids
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
the families
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
and to start that conversation now with
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
the community
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason to be speaking to
 
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
me there's no reason to be speaking with
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
three different communities all at the
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
same time when the department you may be
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
right the department may already know
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
where they want to go and now is the
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
time to start talking with that
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
community and start really understanding
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
what this involves
 
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
so Mr rips and I think I think we've
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
heard a lot from you and and picked up
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
on your reluctance to just answer the
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
question point blank is is this your is
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
this your supervisor your manager your
 
02:04:41.330 --> 02:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
director your your assistant
 
02:04:44.209 --> 02:04:44.219 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the audience
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
because I'd love to hear from you I
 
02:04:47.930 --> 02:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from the person
 
02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
highest in the food chain on this
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
because I I think poor Mr ribson is
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
being put in a highly awkward spot where
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have the authority to say
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be in Hampstead and
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
and if I were Mr Williams I'd advise him
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
not to say that if it is his friend I
 
02:05:07.370 --> 02:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
would say I I don't think he should
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
answer that question but you you you are
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
a leader you you get paid The Big Box
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
come on up and tell us what you think
 
02:05:18.350 --> 02:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
really think about Hampstead please I'll
 
02:05:20.209 --> 02:05:20.219 align:start position:0%
do all due respect I think I think I'm
 
02:05:25.070 --> 02:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a leader too and um and uh
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
to be fair right
 
02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
there as I've shared there are three
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
possible sites that are being considered
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
I think it was pretty clear when we
 
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
spoke yesterday of the three possible
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
sites which one has the most is the most
 
02:05:38.930 --> 02:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
advantageous and that is Hampstead but
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
until we actually do the work to do site
 
02:05:43.550 --> 02:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation to determine if that's even
 
02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
feasible for us to say that that's the
 
02:05:47.810 --> 02:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
site would be irresponsible
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
right so that's I I don't think we can
 
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
give you the solid answer you won until
 
02:05:56.570 --> 02:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
the work is done to see and even then
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
that might not be the final decision
 
02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
because right the department also is not
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
the final decider on these things right
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
you work in an executive branch that has
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
a governor and executive Council so you
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
know the opinion that I express is not
 
02:06:12.169 --> 02:06:12.179 align:start position:0%
necessarily what the final decision is
 
02:06:14.810 --> 02:06:14.820 align:start position:0%
so you know I I understand frustration
 
02:06:16.609 --> 02:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
and wanting an answer but at the same
 
02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
time you know if I give you an answer it
 
02:06:20.930 --> 02:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's an answer that I don't actually
 
02:06:23.149 --> 02:06:23.159 align:start position:0%
have the ability to provide
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
and an answer that would be so it's an
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
army guy who trained Afghans how to
 
02:06:29.570 --> 02:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
shoot we we taught them ready aim fire
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
we didn't teach them ready fire aim and
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
that's what I I think I'm hearing is we
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
want to just say okay we're ready go
 
02:06:40.129 --> 02:06:40.139 align:start position:0%
ahead and fire we're going to go to
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
Hampstead and then later we'll keep
 
02:06:43.490 --> 02:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
figuring out that's going to be the
 
02:06:46.189 --> 02:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
aiming I don't want to do that I wanted
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
us to get ready I want us to aim at the
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
three sites and then I want us to pull
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
the trigger on the correct site there's
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
a discipline process here I'd love to
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
follow it and Madam Deputy Commissioner
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
would you read your name and I'll I'll
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
concur with with Joe and I think there
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
are many you know considerations that
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
need to be put into this I think Joe
 
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
presented yesterday to your committee on
 
02:07:14.089 --> 02:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
some of the shared saving possibilities
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
um Joe and I work closely with Hampstead
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
Hospital but there may be other
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
considerations as well so we really are
 
02:07:22.370 --> 02:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
not in a position nor is it our role to
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
be um to be stating what the site should
 
02:07:27.890 --> 02:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
be so we can't get there today
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I hope the media is fair with you
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
we've asked you to step into a very
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
awkward situation and I apologize and I
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
hope you're treated fairly
 
02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
representative Norton and then
 
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Poole thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I would just like your comments on
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
we'll start today and I just was
 
02:07:57.169 --> 02:07:57.179 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had any comments about
 
02:07:57.179 --> 02:07:59.109 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had any comments about
it

02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:59.119 --> 02:08:00.649 align:start position:0%
it
so

02:08:00.649 --> 02:08:00.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
um in general right I still support
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one I think that the work
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
has been done to know where we need to
 
02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
move this
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
um yes there's some questions that
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be answered until we
 
02:08:13.370 --> 02:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
move through the process and you know
 
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
honestly I'd
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
I'd wish that we had the type of trust
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
in each other that we can move forward
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
and trust that we're going to make
 
02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
decisions about these things in the best
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
interest of the folks that we serve and
 
02:08:25.250 --> 02:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's disappointing to me that we don't
 
02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
have that trust
 
02:08:29.209 --> 02:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
um that's what I think is the right path
 
02:08:29.219 --> 02:08:30.169 align:start position:0%
um that's what I think is the right path
forward

02:08:30.169 --> 02:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment you know there's some very
 
02:08:33.649 --> 02:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
critical things that have to happen
 
02:08:35.930 --> 02:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
right now the most critical thing that
 
02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
has to happen right now is that the
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
facility doesn't close in three weeks
 
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
that absolutely needs to happen
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of the day today
 
02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
that there's agreement on that
 
02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
um and that there's movement on that I
 
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
would like us to move forward with the
 
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:51.780 align:start position:0%
rest of the package but that's the
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical point
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
02:08:58.729 --> 02:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
a representable
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
coming at this from a technical
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
background and thinking about process
 
02:09:06.830 --> 02:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
right there's three options that are
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
currently in play I'm not aware of any
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
others no one has discussed any others
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
but typically you rank them relative to
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
one another
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
one another over a number of criteria
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
when can the department have that
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
information to us
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
I I think I've already kind of assessed
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
for everybody yesterday what what the
 
02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.050 align:start position:0%
for everybody yesterday what what the
Departments

02:09:27.050 --> 02:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
Departments
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
column so
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
um part of this also is getting some
 
02:09:38.810 --> 02:09:38.820 align:start position:0%
feedback from the various communities
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
that are in play right so it's more than
 
02:09:43.070 --> 02:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
just correct what the how the department
 
02:09:45.169 --> 02:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
sees it one of the criteria on this list
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
by which we will be making the decision
 
02:09:50.270 --> 02:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
right is how the community feels what
 
02:09:52.129 --> 02:09:52.139 align:start position:0%
the impact of the community will be in
 
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
terms of Public Services a bunch of
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
other things that were discussed
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
yesterday in our division
 
02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
I'm used to seeing this as something
 
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
called the Pew chart p-u-g-h which is a
 
02:10:06.050 --> 02:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
process by which you do this you rank
 
02:10:08.810 --> 02:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
your options on one axis and you rank
 
02:10:10.250 --> 02:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
the criteria by which you're going to
 
02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
score those options on the other axis
 
02:10:14.810 --> 02:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
and then you just do do the analysis and
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
go through this I would personally like
 
02:10:18.890 --> 02:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
to see that as soon as possible I don't
 
02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
know how quickly we can do that that
 
02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
might involve having a meeting over in
 
02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
Hampstead might have a meeting in
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
Concord somewhere to find and get some
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
feedback that may take a couple of days
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
I hear you that we can't we need to
 
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
address the issue of closure right away
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
got it that's which is in my eyes at
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
least lines nine and following at a
 
02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
minimum but I would like to see that the
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
department takes lead
 
02:10:44.810 --> 02:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
and starts to schedule public feedback
 
02:10:46.609 --> 02:10:46.619 align:start position:0%
sessions from these communities so we
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand that because that's important
 
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.089 --> 02:10:56.099 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that was a question or
 
02:10:58.490 --> 02:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
not but I guess it's how if that is the
 
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
request any idea how long it would take
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
to schedule that and get back to us I
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't know how long that would take I'd
 
02:11:05.089 --> 02:11:05.099 align:start position:0%
have to look into that and talk to other
 
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
folks so let me ask you about
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
criticality I I know what the hot urgent
 
02:11:13.010 --> 02:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
burning issues are the the two we need
 
02:11:15.229 --> 02:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
more time we need some operations money
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
got it okay
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm pretty fired up on the idea that
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
we have some arpa money out there
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
that uh we have to hit some milestones
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to use it I'm not a
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
gopher expert but you know I I think
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's fairly clear that the longer we
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
wait the more at risk I can't measure
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
that risk I just think that it's there
 
02:11:44.270 --> 02:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
that the longer we wait the more there's
 
02:11:47.330 --> 02:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
risk so so
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
is it critical that we go ahead and
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
begin the site evaluation that's in this
 
02:11:56.330 --> 02:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
paragraph on the two million dollar
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
appropriation is it critical that we
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
begin that and fund that now or do you
 
02:12:05.209 --> 02:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
already have the money and ability to go
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
ahead and begin that formal Society
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation without legislative action we
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
do not have the resources to do any of
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
that the process that had been
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
envisioned working with the As and the
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works that that was
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to be built into the contract with
 
02:12:22.129 --> 02:12:22.139 align:start position:0%
the future you know design firm if
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking about carving that out as
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
a separate process altogether I'd have
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
to talk to the Department of Public
 
02:12:28.370 --> 02:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
Works about what that would look like I
 
02:12:29.689 --> 02:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
couldn't speculate as to what that would
 
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
look like so so just to close us I'll
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
come to your representative Weiler yes
 
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
or no do you think the appropriation so
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
that you can begin the contracted side
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
evaluation is
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
urgent is that a critical issue is that
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
something we ought to be doing like now
 
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
I think that if we if the goal is to get
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
this right the goal that I've always
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
understood for the past couple years was
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
that this needs to get done immediately
 
02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:01.619 align:start position:0%
right there were timelines put on this
 
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
that were incredibly tight and ambitious
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
under the best of circumstances that's
 
02:13:07.609 --> 02:13:07.619 align:start position:0%
why we went ahead and started working
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
with DPW and Architects to try to be
 
02:13:11.930 --> 02:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
ready to go at the moment that this
 
02:13:14.149 --> 02:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
legislature said go
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
if that's no longer the reality then
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's then that then that is what it is
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
right the
 
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
I would I would want to move as much as
 
02:13:26.089 --> 02:13:26.099 align:start position:0%
possible as soon as possible because I
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
feel that if we don't actually get to
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
work on this what I fear is that we're
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
not gonna ever get this done I sat in
 
02:13:34.729 --> 02:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
the hearing room downstairs five years
 
02:13:36.890 --> 02:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
ago listening to you know people
 
02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
admonish us for not doing this you know
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
six months after I walked into New
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the first time in my life
 
02:13:45.770 --> 02:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
and you know frankly it's time to get it
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
done and um so I'd rather do something
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
than nothing
 
02:13:53.209 --> 02:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
to so Madam commissioner yes or no is is
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
the money to begin the site evaluation
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
critical or not
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
I do believe it's critical and and part
 
02:14:01.609 --> 02:14:01.619 align:start position:0%
of what haunts me is Imagining the
 
02:14:03.530 --> 02:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
staffing issues that are going to
 
02:14:06.649 --> 02:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
transpire without any serious plan and I
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
think that is indicative of forward
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
movement and it's already going to be
 
02:14:11.390 --> 02:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
hard enough to keep the place um
 
02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
functioning safely
 
02:14:15.310 --> 02:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weiler well
 
02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
have you been waiting representative
 
02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
tolersky because I know representative
 
02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
Weiler is ready do you do you have
 
02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:22.370 align:start position:0%
Weiler is ready do you do you have
something

02:14:22.370 --> 02:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's related to what you were saying
 
02:14:26.209 --> 02:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
which was a clarification for what we
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday which was
 
02:14:32.569 --> 02:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
the it sounded to me and I I guess I'm
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if I'm wrong that
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday we heard the department is
 
02:14:39.050 --> 02:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the process of
 
02:14:41.209 --> 02:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
determining the best site and you did
 
02:14:43.729 --> 02:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
not need us to give you that green light
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
to do it you did not need us to give you
 
02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
to do it you did not need us to give you
the

02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
part of the two million dollars to get
 
02:14:53.689 --> 02:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
that done so I guess I'm confused as to
 
02:14:58.729 --> 02:14:58.739 align:start position:0%
what was just exchanged here no
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not sure exactly what
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
what you were calling from yesterday or
 
02:15:04.669 --> 02:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
if I misspoke but the site evaluation
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
was always intended to be part of the
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
contract with the with the external
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
Architects that piece of the work was
 
02:15:13.550 --> 02:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
through them making the final
 
02:15:15.530 --> 02:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
determination around Sight can't be done
 
02:15:18.050 --> 02:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
until that work is done right and that
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
work was going to be the first part of
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
what would be done under that contract
 
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
so yesterday I remember talking about
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
that that would be something that would
 
02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
probably be from my memory because I
 
02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the looked at that
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
proposal recently would have been done
 
02:15:32.569 --> 02:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
first and probably in a matter of weeks
 
02:15:35.209 --> 02:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
to a month or so from the start of that
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
contract so that would be the first
 
02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
piece of work done on that contract and
 
02:15:40.490 --> 02:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
that it would therefore be information
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
that would be available for the
 
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
September 30 date for the committee that
 
02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
was being discussed yesterday but the
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
site evaluation work was always a
 
02:15:49.129 --> 02:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
component of what needed to be done to
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
make a final decision about a location
 
02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
we couldn't make a final decision
 
02:15:55.629 --> 02:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
without doing that work
 
02:15:58.129 --> 02:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
no all right representative Weiler and
 
02:16:03.229 --> 02:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
then representative norgren
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
I've been to all three sites
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
I was a representative for Hampstead for
 
02:16:11.629 --> 02:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
20 years before redistricting
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
I've talked with the representatives
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
from Hampstead and the senator
 
02:16:18.890 --> 02:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
who was involved in Senate bill one
 
02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.209 align:start position:0%
who was involved in Senate bill one
um

02:16:20.209 --> 02:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:22.189 --> 02:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
there's more flexibility on Hampstead
 
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
than any other site
 
02:16:27.890 --> 02:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
that's about 100 acres of woods it's
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
off the beaten path
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's not on a main road
 
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in Hampstead don't even
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
know it's there it's the hospital that
 
02:16:37.549 --> 02:16:37.559 align:start position:0%
presently exists
 
02:16:37.559 --> 02:16:39.889 align:start position:0%
presently exists
and

02:16:39.889 --> 02:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
putting it near the site in Manchester
 
02:16:46.370 --> 02:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
but it would need another kitchen it
 
02:16:47.929 --> 02:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
would need somebody to provide meals
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
that isn't there they don't have a
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
laundry if they get to Hampstead or
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
Concord they have shared facilities they
 
02:16:57.049 --> 02:16:57.059 align:start position:0%
could have meals brought
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
from another facility as well as laundry
 
02:17:04.849 --> 02:17:04.859 align:start position:0%
but having sat through the review on the
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric facility on Concord I
 
02:17:10.669 --> 02:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
know the limitations that we've heard
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
about Concord and there isn't that many
 
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
places you could try it and the talk of
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
wetlands and all that stuff so there's
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and where it would go
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
and what can be done in Hampstead as
 
02:17:25.009 --> 02:17:25.019 align:start position:0%
well as providing adjacent services that
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
puts it out in front in my book
 
02:17:29.450 --> 02:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't think the Hampstead people
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
are going to be objective to it for that
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
small population and that that uh
 
02:17:37.310 --> 02:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
plus they're getting the property taxes
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
I think we've got that included that
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
they would have lost
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
by the the Private Hospital being sold
 
02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:45.469 align:start position:0%
by the the Private Hospital being sold
so

02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
I think there's as that was a big a big
 
02:17:50.089 --> 02:17:50.099 align:start position:0%
stumbling block for Hampstead which has
 
02:17:52.849 --> 02:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
gone away as far as I'm concerned so
 
02:17:55.370 --> 02:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
I think that we can we can be certain
 
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
that it will end up in Hampstead and
 
02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:58.790 align:start position:0%
that it will end up in Hampstead and
that

02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:18:02.089 --> 02:18:02.099 align:start position:0%
they may fine tune it a little more and
 
02:18:03.889 --> 02:18:03.899 align:start position:0%
pick exactly the site they want in
 
02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
Hampstead but I think that place has the
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
most flexibility and is way ahead of the
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
other sites so I wish we could agree on
 
02:18:14.450 --> 02:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
this and and get the ball rolling I
 
02:18:15.709 --> 02:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
don't want to see this happen where
 
02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're always two years behind or maybe
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
five years behind
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
um we can't keep kicking the can down
 
02:18:24.009 --> 02:18:24.019 align:start position:0%
the road let's move and accept this
 
02:18:28.250 --> 02:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
amendment and pass sb1 and SB 49 they're
 
02:18:30.290 --> 02:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
both the same we can move forward on
 
02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
this I hate to see all this delays thank
 
02:18:34.910 --> 02:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you representative Waller
 
02:18:37.969 --> 02:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
and uh as as the chair of the committee
 
02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:40.139 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question it's getting
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
close to 1 30 where you said you'd be
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
pulling us out of recess of the full
 
02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
Finance it it feels to me like I need
 
02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
another 20 minutes to be able to give
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
you a clear recommendation of division
 
02:18:54.589 --> 02:18:54.599 align:start position:0%
three where we stand on uh this
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
amendment or any other Amendment get it
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
done get it done okay thank you sir
 
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
representative norgren yeah I
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to add to the discussion and I
 
02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
yesterday I was watching online and I
 
02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
was texting Mary Jane and Laura because
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
I I think we have to keep considering
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
the employees of this organization
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
um I think all the indecision is hard
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
for them I think we're everyone's having
 
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
trouble retaining employees under the
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
conditions we have now
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I I think we have
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
urgency for that reason to make a
 
02:19:38.270 --> 02:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
decision and get things moving so people
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
who work there know where they're going
 
02:19:44.089 --> 02:19:44.099 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing have some
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
stability in their lives so you can hire
 
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:48.540 align:start position:0%
more people in fact
 
02:19:51.010 --> 02:19:51.020 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to say that thank you
 
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't hear a question in
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
there unless you want to argue with her
 
02:19:57.770 --> 02:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham do you have
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
yeah just it seems to me that
 
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
um you know down to the minutia of what
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're talking about uh it
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're gonna you would need
 
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
some appropriation uh to go through the
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
site evaluation process as you've
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
described so moving the number from 2
 
02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
million to zero
 
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
um uh would uh hamper your progress
 
02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:21.349 align:start position:0%
um uh would uh hamper your progress
somewhat

02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
02:20:22.969 --> 02:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:20:24.889 --> 02:20:24.899 align:start position:0%
um uh you know you know if we more
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
limited and and by the way I trust you
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
with my life this is this is just you
 
02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
know I'm just here to represent the
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
community and and make sure when we ask
 
02:20:35.810 --> 02:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
them to pay money that that we're
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
getting something from it so and I thank
 
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
you very much for all your testimony
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
over the last few days
 
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:20:43.849 --> 02:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
um and you know I don't know which way
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
we as a group will will go and you know
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
continue with this larger package are
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
limited to a site evaluation
 
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
but if there's a number less than 2
 
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
million and bigger than zero that would
 
02:20:58.670 --> 02:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
allow you full flexibility to go through
 
02:21:00.290 --> 02:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
with the site evaluation what would that
 
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
number be the truth is I don't know the
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
answer to that question right the two
 
02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
million all these numbers have come from
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
services and the vision of Public Works
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
who are the experts and how we build
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
things and everything else in the state
 
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and in fact DHHS
 
02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
where the DPW is the the lead on all
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
these efforts and we're kind of the
 
02:21:22.969 --> 02:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
client who is Consulting on on you know
 
02:21:24.530 --> 02:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
what the needs are around these efforts
 
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
so anything I would give would be a
 
02:21:29.090 --> 02:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
total guess and I really you know
 
02:21:30.410 --> 02:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
somebody else's guess would probably be
 
02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
better than mine I I would wag 400 000.
 
02:21:37.309 --> 02:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
that would be My Wag just doing projects
 
02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
in the past but
 
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
um all right any other questions on this
 
02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
because what I'd like to do now is I
 
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
want to get a sense of the division on
 
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 31 I'm going to ask two
 
02:21:49.620 --> 02:21:50.710 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 31 I'm going to ask two
things

02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll it only becomes one
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to know
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes or no do you accept the language
 
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
that's already written on Amendment zero
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
four five four lines 25 through 31 as is
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
I have no issues with the language I do
 
02:22:16.849 --> 02:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
ask for a clarification though because
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
in line 27 we have requests to procure a
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
qualified architect and then line 28
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
right which is start the project
 
02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
immediately I hear that right get the
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
architect up and running and then in
 
02:22:31.610 --> 02:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
line 28 I hear a request if you're a
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
contractor to build and I don't think
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's going in parallel so it's the
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
same language with two different actions
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that I
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
understand or that we somehow document
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
that this is to get to Define where
 
02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
we're going but not necessarily go build
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
and I think I would interpret request a
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
procure a contractor winning more of an
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
RFP right request for proposal process
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
as opposed to issue a PO but that I just
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
would like that clarified you know I
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
think I had stumbled on this before and
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
we had initially written requests for
 
02:23:07.849 --> 02:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
proposal and that got changed somewhere
 
02:23:11.090 --> 02:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
on the along the line and and I think
 
02:23:14.090 --> 02:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
you've picked up a nice little rub there
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
that we want to figure out the way it
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
should lay down I I I I the first one I
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
think is a request to procure because
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
all the RFP stuff has been done they're
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
ready to pull the trigger I believe I
 
02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
did Mr ribson do you want to tell us if
 
02:23:30.110 --> 02:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
they're both meant to be requests for
 
02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
procure and if we do tend to limit if we
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
decide to limit this do we need to
 
02:23:37.849 --> 02:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
strike that authorization language so
 
02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
DPW uses multiple different types of
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
procurement tools
 
02:23:43.070 --> 02:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
right and again this is outside of my
 
02:23:44.570 --> 02:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
scope of expertise but I've learned a
 
02:23:45.889 --> 02:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
little bit trying to go through this
 
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
process and they're not they don't
 
02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
typically use the request for proposal
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
tool even though that's the tool that we
 
02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
typically use in vhhs right so the
 
02:23:56.210 --> 02:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
reason why we used the language procure
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
was just to be flexible in the type of
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
public procurement tool that they would
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
use to not prescribe which tool is
 
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate that they would use the
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
request for X whatever that is
 
02:24:08.450 --> 02:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
um based on their you know expertise in
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
judgment as the best way to publicly
 
02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
legally appropriately procure that
 
02:24:12.420 --> 02:24:13.849 align:start position:0%
legally appropriately procure that
service

02:24:13.849 --> 02:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:24:16.309 --> 02:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
I I just realized I was on the wrong
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
section we're still on lines 15 through
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
24 and I I got myself jumbled oh
 
02:24:27.010 --> 02:24:27.020 align:start position:0%
so so but that was good foreshadowing uh
 
02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
representative hole would your concern
 
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
about the second request for procure
 
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
be satisfied if we ended up striking on
 
02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:39.380 align:start position:0%
line 17 the phrase architect
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
consultation and development of design
 
02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:43.010 align:start position:0%
consultation and development of design
options

02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
options
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
I am okay with that I am okay with what
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
we agreed to yesterday look at both both
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
are options
 
02:24:52.190 --> 02:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
um if we're going to change the
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
the effort right then probably the the
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
amount spent should also be changed so
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll go back to what I meant to say
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're going yes or no do you accept the
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
language as written for lines 15 through
 
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.490 align:start position:0%
language as written for lines 15 through
24.

02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
24.
 
02:25:10.610 --> 02:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stringham
 
02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I I prefer what you just described so
 
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
we'll you you're open to a modification
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
you don't so you're a no on just
 
02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
accepting this language well I'm I'm
 
02:25:24.770 --> 02:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.309 --> 02:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
so I'll say no thank you
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weiler yes or no on
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
let's see a problem on 27 and 28 uh it's
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's a request of accurate qualified
 
02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
architect honor before March 1st and
 
02:25:44.929 --> 02:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
shall collaborate to issue a request to
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
procure a contractor to build the
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
resulting construction project
 
02:25:51.530 --> 02:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's assumes in my mind after you have
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
the design it doesn't mean they have to
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
be done at the same moment yeah so it's
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
The Logical way to read it so you're a
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes on 15 through 24. uh representative
 
02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:04.070 align:start position:0%
yes on 15 through 24. uh representative
Wallner

02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
02:26:07.490 --> 02:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
no I'm not are you open to tweaking it
 
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
to limit it to Simply site evaluation
 
02:26:13.969 --> 02:26:13.979 align:start position:0%
I I think that's what I brought up with
 
02:26:16.010 --> 02:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
site location first
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and as far as
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
money in there I'd have to think about
 
02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
that for a little while longer and I
 
02:26:24.170 --> 02:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
don't know that 400 000 is the right
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
amount but that I would replace that
 
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
whole section with
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
um do you have language right now that
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
you can offer the committee
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
we we we're on a March one doesn't
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
about so you're you're you're you're a
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
no and you're a no on a simple
 
02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
modification to just leave site
 
02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
modification to just leave site
evaluation

02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
and in the in the dollar amount you're
 
02:26:57.770 --> 02:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
you're no one either is the dollar
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
amount 400 000. I I would wag it at 400
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
000. well do you have a better wag
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
I don't have the slightest idea what
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
what it would be I would need some
 
02:27:10.190 --> 02:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
someone who knew
 
02:27:12.170 --> 02:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
about um I mean someone like from
 
02:27:14.330 --> 02:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
administrative Services because that was
 
02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
the right amount all right 50 years of
 
02:27:19.010 --> 02:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
judgment like 400 000 is not a bad whack
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative tolersky do you accept
 
02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
the language is written lines 15 through
 
02:27:29.210 --> 02:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
24. I'm a no on it as written I would be
 
02:27:31.250 --> 02:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
open to sing you're open to a
 
02:27:34.250 --> 02:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
modification representative nordgren
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
you you accept that language as is
 
02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
no I accept change in the language
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
you're open to tweaking it
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
I would propose uh leaving it as is and
 
02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
also you brought up a good point that um
 
02:27:51.770 --> 02:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
I know our discussions could go on in
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
perpetuity in fact it doesn't change the
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
date it actually brings the date closer
 
02:27:58.130 --> 02:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
March 1st actually comes closer with
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
every moment that we're here
 
02:28:02.210 --> 02:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so I like representative
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
Weiler proposed moving this amendment to
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
our exec session
 
02:28:07.730 --> 02:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm I'm so sorry I'm just not
 
02:28:13.849 --> 02:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
there yet so uh that I my head count is
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
four four on accepting the language is
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
is uh for against and now I'm gonna
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
explore a tweak in a uh and an effort to
 
02:28:26.330 --> 02:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
get us to say yes to one another
 
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:30.420 align:start position:0%
if we changed on line 16
 
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
2 million
 
02:28:35.690 --> 02:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
to four hundred thousand
 
02:28:38.090 --> 02:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we could put a not to exceed in
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
there just to really you know make that
 
02:28:41.270 --> 02:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
more clear
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think the department tries to
 
02:28:46.610 --> 02:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
waste money so we could make that a not
 
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
to exceed four hundred thousand dollars
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
and on line 17 leave for the purpose of
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
site evaluation there because we all
 
02:29:00.130 --> 02:29:00.140 align:start position:0%
agree that's important and then strike
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
delete from the word development through
 
02:29:14.349 --> 02:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
the word
 
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
what through just design options
 
02:29:19.849 --> 02:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
development of design options so that
 
02:29:21.469 --> 02:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
would read for the purpose of site
 
02:29:23.990 --> 02:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation for replacement facility for
 
02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
the sununu Youth Center
 
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that that is my proposed
 
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
alternative language
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
would you accept that representative
 
02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:36.650 align:start position:0%
would you accept that representative
hole

02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
so if I'm reading if I'm hearing what
 
02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
you said and I'll restate it for
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
clarification right 16 is now four
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars 17 we strike
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
out architect consultation and
 
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
development of design options
 
02:29:54.410 --> 02:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
my concern then is lines 18 and 19 the
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
department shall develop two design
 
02:29:57.950 --> 02:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
options we're still mandating that that
 
02:29:59.929 --> 02:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
happened but we didn't fund it so I
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
think there's a conflict right a
 
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
technical conflict
 
02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
um that I don't know what to do with
 
02:30:09.050 --> 02:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
okay so so how about if we strike on
 
02:30:10.969 --> 02:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
line 19
 
02:30:10.979 --> 02:30:13.550 align:start position:0%
line 19
um

02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
for the shall develop design options
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
because the rest of this is kind of
 
02:30:22.849 --> 02:30:22.859 align:start position:0%
clarifying on the site evaluation piece
 
02:30:25.370 --> 02:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
of this for the site evaluation it's
 
02:30:27.469 --> 02:30:27.479 align:start position:0%
helpful for them to know
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
starting on 18 on to 19 the department
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
for possibilities
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
for two possibilities a facility with a
 
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
capacity of six to twelve and a capacity
 
02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
of 12 to 18. so at least they know what
 
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
they're evaluating I am okay with the
 
02:30:45.889 --> 02:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
proposed 400 000 for site evaluation to
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
consider two design options right not
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
architect not go do detailed engineering
 
02:30:54.349 --> 02:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
drawings but two conceptual right
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
and have those as information to present
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature because
 
02:31:00.590 --> 02:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday we spent a lot of time talking
 
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
about who's making the decision on where
 
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
this goes I don't think there was
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
agreement amongst the entire division
 
02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
that the legislature should be making
 
02:31:10.610 --> 02:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
the decision ultimately on where this is
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
so the site evaluation and the design
 
02:31:14.330 --> 02:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
options coming back to us is a good
 
02:31:17.389 --> 02:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
thing so so my disclaimer on this as we
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
go flying by is that I know that Mr
 
02:31:22.610 --> 02:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
Ripple is listening he's following the
 
02:31:23.889 --> 02:31:23.899 align:start position:0%
antenna he's following the
 
02:31:26.210 --> 02:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
strikethroughs and when he gets to
 
02:31:28.130 --> 02:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
writing an amendment to the amendment
 
02:31:30.530 --> 02:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
he'll he'll he he's probably going to
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
have a tweak in there that makes it
 
02:31:36.730 --> 02:31:36.740 align:start position:0%
smooth without killing the intent so
 
02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
you do that all the time so that that's
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
where the member of your intent as
 
02:31:43.849 --> 02:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
discussed okay so uh representative
 
02:31:46.849 --> 02:31:46.859 align:start position:0%
Stringham modified language would you be
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
open to that yes or no
 
02:31:48.780 --> 02:31:49.550 align:start position:0%
open to that yes or no
um

02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:52.510 --> 02:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh subject to seeing it yes okay
 
02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
02:31:58.130 --> 02:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
yes with the caveat though that I think
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
by taking out the original language we
 
02:32:05.690 --> 02:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
move further away from Senate bill one
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
but the answer to your question is yes
 
02:32:10.429 --> 02:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
okay I think that was a true statement
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler yes representative
 
02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:15.290 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler yes representative
walner

02:32:15.290 --> 02:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
walner
 
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
I think I want to see the language but
 
02:32:19.730 --> 02:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
yes I think I can go with that thank you
 
02:32:22.370 --> 02:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
for that representative yes upon
 
02:32:24.410 --> 02:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
reviewing it representative Morgan yes
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so good uh that part's
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
unanimous let's let's skinny up the
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
section on appropriation to to put 400
 
02:32:37.130 --> 02:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
000 for begin the side evaluation
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay then paragraph four line 25 through
 
02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:42.950 align:start position:0%
okay then paragraph four line 25 through
31

02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
31
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
the key thing that this does the most
 
02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
powerful aspect of this whole section
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
from my point of view is that final
 
02:32:53.570 --> 02:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
sentence the sysc shall immediately be
 
02:32:55.969 --> 02:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
closed for detention or admission of any
 
02:32:58.130 --> 02:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
child when a replacement facility is
 
02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
sufficiently completed the children can
 
02:33:02.330 --> 02:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
be legal and safely housed there that
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
way we're not facing the guillotine of
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
an of an of another date we're just
 
02:33:09.170 --> 02:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
saying let's let's do the replacement
 
02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh is there any other part of lines 25
 
02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
through 31
 
02:33:17.809 --> 02:33:17.819 align:start position:0%
that that anyone wants to discuss
 
02:33:21.050 --> 02:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairs as I pointed out earlier and
 
02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
words matter and yeah versus
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
um some sort of proposal right are very
 
02:33:29.230 --> 02:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
different to me so so
 
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not disagreeing I just need words on
 
02:33:35.290 --> 02:33:35.300 align:start position:0%
line 28 the return request
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
a change procure to proposal yes please
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
okay and and the in the and the only
 
02:33:46.490 --> 02:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
disclaimer there is we don't know the
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
words that our state uses but the term
 
02:33:52.250 --> 02:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
request for proposal makes
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
02:33:57.770 --> 02:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
so hopefully our state has a similar
 
02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:59.809 align:start position:0%
so hopefully our state has a similar
word

02:33:59.809 --> 02:33:59.819 align:start position:0%
word
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you're okay with that with that
 
02:34:04.849 --> 02:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
change in that word I am representative
 
02:34:04.859 --> 02:34:06.349 align:start position:0%
change in that word I am representative
Stringham

02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
Stringham
 
02:34:09.889 --> 02:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Mooney yes
 
02:34:09.899 --> 02:34:11.889 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Mooney yes
Weiler

02:34:11.889 --> 02:34:11.899 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
I'd want to read it but I think with the
 
02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
word change yeah okay Yep this is all
 
02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
content contingent upon reading it yes
 
02:34:26.210 --> 02:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative yes okay again we
 
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
got some unanimity with the one word
 
02:34:32.330 --> 02:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
change on line 28 for requests for to
 
02:34:36.290 --> 02:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
procure to request for proposal
 
02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
then on line 32 this is the commission
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
I recommend we just keep the whole
 
02:34:45.290 --> 02:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
commission I mean you know we we're
 
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and start the
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation process I think this
 
02:34:50.570 --> 02:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
commission is a vital part of it this
 
02:34:52.429 --> 02:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
commission is limited in its Authority
 
02:34:54.650 --> 02:34:54.660 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any decisions it's going
 
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to write report lines 1
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
through 33.
 
02:35:05.210 --> 02:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
just a small Point yes sir
 
02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:08.570 align:start position:0%
just a small Point yes sir
um

02:35:08.570 --> 02:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:12.410 --> 02:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh just to comply with 1449 can we just
 
02:35:15.530 --> 02:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:18.410 --> 02:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
G and H representative
 
02:35:21.050 --> 02:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
rather than representatives and and
 
02:35:23.690 --> 02:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
perhaps add one House member make it
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
four and three or something oh okay
 
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
let's do one at a time on line 15 and I
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
think the same thing is going to be true
 
02:35:34.010 --> 02:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
on line 17. the the word is currently
 
02:35:38.990 --> 02:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
plural Representatives right so so in in
 
02:35:40.730 --> 02:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
the way that I've written things that
 
02:35:42.650 --> 02:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
has been accepted I don't know if my
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
fifth grade English teacher would agree
 
02:35:47.510 --> 02:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
but I would put the S of Representatives
 
02:35:49.969 --> 02:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
in parentheses so it could be a
 
02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative or Representatives
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
without specifying a number and the
 
02:35:57.469 --> 02:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
reason for not specifying a number is is
 
02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
just so that we can do things rationally
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
if they really get fixated on Hampstead
 
02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
they can bother the Hampstead people
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
without trying to get a conquered person
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
to show up
 
02:36:12.590 --> 02:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
so so what does that work Mr Ripple if
 
02:36:14.809 --> 02:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
we just put the S of Representatives in
 
02:36:19.010 --> 02:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:20.090 align:start position:0%
 
could

02:36:20.090 --> 02:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
as representative Stringham points out
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
so RSA 1449 caps the number of members
 
02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the commission at 15 and contains
 
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
various other requirements
 
02:36:30.889 --> 02:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one
 
02:36:32.270 --> 02:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
actually had language saying
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 1449 that I noticed
 
02:36:36.530 --> 02:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
is missing from this so I would add that
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
to this language as well tell me what
 
02:36:41.809 --> 02:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
line item you would put notwithstanding
 
02:36:41.819 --> 02:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
line item you would put notwithstanding
um

02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the sentence that's
 
02:36:48.170 --> 02:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
at the end of line five the commission
 
02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
shall consist of the following members I
 
02:36:53.150 --> 02:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
would say notwithstanding RSA 1449 the
 
02:36:54.410 --> 02:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
commission shall consist of the
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
following members okay I'm I'm okay with
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure what it means but
 
02:37:05.690 --> 02:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh I like saying yes so so so lines 30
 
02:37:10.849 --> 02:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
if excuse me one through 33 on page two
 
02:37:15.170 --> 02:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
we've suggested tweaks to add the RSA on
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
line five and to change representatives
 
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
to the parenthetical so that we can get
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
the right number is there any any
 
02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:25.870 align:start position:0%
the right number is there any any
discussion

02:37:25.870 --> 02:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative Mooney
 
02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
fine and I would just point out on line
 
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
five fire safety has been added for our
 
02:37:44.210 --> 02:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
well yes we'd added uh other relevant
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
factors too so yeah right yes yes ma'am
 
02:37:53.450 --> 02:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
um representative Weiler yes or no
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes question Mr chair um yes what's
 
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
three what's the relationship of the
 
02:38:07.429 --> 02:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
department to this Commission
 
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
commission do you have any ex official
 
02:38:11.330 --> 02:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
role or what
 
02:38:14.990 --> 02:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
what's their relationship
 
02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
well if I read line 10 properly C the
 
02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Health
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
and Human Services or designee is is on
 
02:38:27.610 --> 02:38:27.620 align:start position:0%
this and I imagine the designee would be
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
something that looks like a Mr ribson
 
02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
but yeah
 
02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
do you have another question do you want
 
02:38:37.490 --> 02:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's the chairman yes
 
02:38:43.130 --> 02:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
a full committee so we're getting very
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
close I'm so sorry I I know you're a
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
fighter pilot
 
02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.250 align:start position:0%
fighter pilot
right

02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:58.429 --> 02:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
you would have a decision yes sir I
 
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
thought I'd have a
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I haven't do I thought I'd have a
 
02:39:05.090 --> 02:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
decision two years ago so uh okay so
 
02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:07.140 align:start position:0%
you're okay with that I think we're all
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
okay with lines one through thirty three
 
02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it gets into
 
02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
repeals and effective dates and and uh I
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
I think we're okay with those
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:39:23.469 --> 02:39:23.479 align:start position:0%
representative hole Stringham
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
Wyler Waller okay
 
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
all right so we have a proposal uh if we
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
come back and it's exactly like this
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
can I expect you to vote Yes on this yes
 
02:39:38.929 --> 02:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
or no
 
02:39:38.939 --> 02:39:42.349 align:start position:0%
or no
yes

02:39:42.349 --> 02:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:49.130 --> 02:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
so that's a yes could you speak into the
 
02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:53.650 align:start position:0%
so that's a yes could you speak into the
microphone

02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tolerski I just
 
02:39:58.670 --> 02:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify go ahead on reviewing
 
02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
it yes I would be able to support it
 
02:40:02.630 --> 02:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
upon reviewing it all right thank you
 
02:40:04.730 --> 02:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
representative norgren yes thank you all
 
02:40:06.889 --> 02:40:06.899 align:start position:0%
right and that's that's always implied
 
02:40:09.950 --> 02:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know you have to be able to read it
 
02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay so so uh I think with that uh I'm
 
02:40:16.670 --> 02:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
ready to to to to to to to recommend to
 
02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
the whole house or excuse me the full
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
committee that we adopt uh what will be
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
the modification to zero four five four
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed and have Mr Ripple go
 
02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
02:40:35.090 --> 02:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh and then the rest of the idea options
 
02:40:40.849 --> 02:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
49 and uh two uh or 527 I'm gonna I'm
 
02:40:42.349 --> 02:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
gonna recess that to the next work
 
02:40:42.359 --> 02:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
gonna recess that to the next work
session

02:40:44.150 --> 02:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
any comments if you're going to have
 
02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
another work session then I have to
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
dismiss the rest of the committee no no
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
next week we're not going to do that
 
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're SB we're we're acting on sb1
 
02:40:57.290 --> 02:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
sir we're not we're gonna we're gonna
 
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
postpone 49 and 527 until a future work
 
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
session that's already being calendared
 
02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
all right so my point is I've had the
 
02:41:07.490 --> 02:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
rest of this committee waiting around
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
this is a result of this
 
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing to report I I I
 
02:41:15.889 --> 02:41:15.899 align:start position:0%
believe there is I believe that we're
 
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
working on a fresh Amendment it'll be
 
02:41:20.809 --> 02:41:20.819 align:start position:0%
coming back as soon as it can and and I
 
02:41:22.849 --> 02:41:22.859 align:start position:0%
think we have as long as there's no
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
typographical error in there or uh we're
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna recommend to the
 
02:41:31.490 --> 02:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
the committee acceptance I hope we have
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
a quorum
 
02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
okay the way we've been delaying all
 
02:41:38.330 --> 02:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
this all right so I'd like to adjourn
 
02:41:40.750 --> 02:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
02:41:43.969 --> 02:41:43.979 align:start position:0%
division three is now adjourned how much
 
02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.010 --> 02:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
I have to inform the rest of the finance
 
02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:02.330 align:start position:0%
I have to inform the rest of the finance
committee

02:42:02.330 --> 02:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we'll meet in an hour
 
02:42:06.110 --> 02:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
or sooner
 
02:42:08.570 --> 02:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
if there's enough of them here to
 
02:42:11.929 --> 02:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.730 --> 02:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
how many are there any out people out in
 
02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:22.939 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
