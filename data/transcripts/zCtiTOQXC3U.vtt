that also has to do with actually
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
potentially a couple bills that have to
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
do with this section
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
and so what we thought we would do
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
is um put them together and basically i
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
tl this one
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%

represent luna thank you very much mr
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
chair um i think that sounds like a a
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
very good plan and um and i think one of
 
01:12:24.709 --> 01:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
those bills might be um
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
hospital uh 1263 that is correct
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
specifically in the area of studies and
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and and i i think
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be great for the
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
community to work with the the advocates
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
on that on that language that um that
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
moves that forward so thanks so we'll
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
we'll support there's a number of areas
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
within health which
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
we could improve that area studies with
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
physical education as well with exercise
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
and nutrition etc
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
so let's let's take a healthy look at
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
that healthy look
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:57.990 align:start position:0%
at that
yeah

01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
area of statute and we're going to move

01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to represent cardelli
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.149 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
this is my bill um i'm the prime sponsor
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
so uh i
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
do not agree with the itl motion i had a
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment ready
 
01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
amendment ready
um

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
that i think addressed some concerns
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
including uh
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
more definition as to activities which
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
would not require activity notice
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
assemblies and guest lectures and so
 
01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.590 align:start position:0%
assemblies and guest lectures and so
forth

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
i think that in my view this
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
goes to putting parents
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
in control of their children's education
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
which is a large issue around the
 
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.550 align:start position:0%
which is a large issue around the
country

01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think that parents
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
should have the right
 
01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:19.189 align:start position:0%
should have the right
to

01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
both know what's going on in the
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
classroom and to um remove their
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
children from
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
areas or lessons that
 
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
they do not believe
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
comply with their
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
family values
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i think it is
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
needed legislation
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to speak in regard to this
 
01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:45.030 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to speak in regard to this
bill

01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes i agree that parents need to know
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their classrooms and
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think there's processes in place where
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
that is that opportunity is afforded
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
my primary reason for
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
objecting to this bill
 
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
the teachable moment is critical in the
 
01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.950 align:start position:0%
the teachable moment is critical in the
classroom

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening in ukraine today
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
if we had to wait two weeks to discuss
 
01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
if we had to wait two weeks to discuss
this

01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
would be horrible
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
to have to hold off
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
and you can have teachable moments when
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
the the instructor asks we had that
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful teacher that was here that
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
taught social studies you don't have to
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
be imparting your opinion you can have
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
shared inquiry where the opinion is
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
bounced back and forth between the kids
 
01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
01:17:33.679 --> 01:17:35.189 align:start position:0%
in the room
and

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
the the end result is we have a open
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
situation in our schools but you look at
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
so many issues that are going on right
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
now you can't wait for the teachable
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
moment when 9 11 occurred
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
you've got to do it then you can't wait
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the teachable moment when i remember
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
what happened at kent state you can't
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
wait for the teachable moment
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
when martin luther king was shot and i
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
can remember that it's etched in my head
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
in in my life um you can't wait for a
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
teachable moment when the volcano where
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
i was in alaska went off on mount
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
augustine the day of it and kids wanted
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
to talk about that area of education you
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't have two weeks
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the law that we have right now is
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
very specific and saying you have to
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
have two weeks notice
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
for issues such as sexual education it
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
was clearly stated
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
now this is now changing it so that you
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
need two weeks notice for just about
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
teachable moment for me when i was a
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
principal and the kid was sent down the
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
office for discipline i didn't expel
 
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:42.950 align:start position:0%
office for discipline i didn't expel
them

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
i talked i took that moment as a
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
teachable moment to try to steer a new
 
01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:48.790 align:start position:0%
teachable moment to try to steer a new
path

01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
path
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
and without
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
throttling the child so that you know
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're destroying uh all interest in
 
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
you're destroying uh all interest in
school

01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
do the same thing with my three-year-old
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
grandchildren child right now there's
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
teachable moment one after another and
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
it comes every other minute
 
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.910 align:start position:0%
it comes every other minute
so

01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to do as teachers as
 
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to do as teachers as
well

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's where i am and that's why i am
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to vote in support of the motion
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%

education across the state

from representative cordelli and second
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
by representative mullen represent
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
cordelia do you care to speak to your
 
01:21:26.159 --> 01:21:27.189 align:start position:0%
cordelia do you care to speak to your
motion

01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh briefly mr chairman um
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree with
 
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:34.149 align:start position:0%
i certainly agree with
the

01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
basically i think
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
part of the intent of this bill in terms
 
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.590 align:start position:0%
part of the intent of this bill in terms
of

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
allowing the public
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
time to comment during board meetings i
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
think that that is an issue
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's an issue that public
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
comment often is held to the end of the
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
meeting so it's
 
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
meeting so it's
after

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
issues that the public might want to
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
comment on has have already been
 
01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.910 align:start position:0%
comment on has have already been
addressed

01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
but i think this bill
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
takes it a step or two too far in terms
 
01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:07.189 align:start position:0%
takes it a step or two too far in terms
of

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:07.199 --> 01:22:09.430 align:start position:0%
of
requiring

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
references to statutes or rules
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
when there is a question from the public
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
i i think it goes to
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
too far
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
generally and
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
might be better addressed in other
 
01:22:24.159 --> 01:22:25.750 align:start position:0%
might be better addressed in other
legislation

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative cordelli
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
that there are sections of the bill that
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
goes too far and also that there's never
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion from members of the
 
01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.910 align:start position:0%

take your time thank you sometimes
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative shaw would tell us to
 
01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.229 align:start position:0%
representative shaw would tell us to
stop

01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
stop

okay so we're going to jump over uh 1137

as uh representative cordelli does have
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment and it's waiting for us
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
upstairs so he'll bring that down
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
and so we'll jump past that right now
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
and go to
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh hb 1295 requiring reports concerning
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
school policies and classroom recordings
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
and in classroom
 
01:24:38.719 --> 01:24:40.229 align:start position:0%
and in classroom
observers

01:24:40.229 --> 01:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
observers
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
and or on and in classroom observers
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh moffat do you have
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh sure mr chair i'd like to move otp
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
representation hi second thank you uh
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
to your motion please
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr you'll recall
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
when i introduced the spell explained
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's a very uh as i said very short very
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
simple and hopefully very sweet
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
there's no policy mandate there's no
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
spending requirement
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then it's modeled on
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
what many of us think is a very
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
successful gifted student
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
bill which we passed last year which is
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
not a lot
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
from the gifted bill um i'm already
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
hearing we're already hearing that all
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
over the state there are conversations
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
and discussions about uh
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
how to better identify and serve gifted
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
students and that was the intent of that
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
bill was to just
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
have districts required to have a
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
discussion and submit a report on what
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
they do or don't do
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
so this is the same thing
 
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
so this is the same thing
in

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
we see especially post covert a need to
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
have some local discussion on audio
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
visual recording policies
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
because during covert when covert is
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
still going on there is uh
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
a lot there was a lot of remote learning
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
there was hybrid learning and
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
which was a new world i don't know if it
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
was a brave new world but
 
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:11.669 align:start position:0%
was a brave new world but
uh

01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of uh questions that
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
did come up around the state about you
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
know who could watch a hybrid class or a
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
remote class could it be recorded
 
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh obviously so from our own experiences
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
this committee had remote hearings last
 
01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:26.229 align:start position:0%
this committee had remote hearings last
year

01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh we had policies about uh who could be
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
there who could listen uh you know
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
we had dogs that were there which we
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
became rather fond of as as uh as time
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
went on
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
those uncharted waters so the focus is
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
of this measure is simply to
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
and several of us have talked to several
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
people at doe about this
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
saw her interest in merit and doing the
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
same thing here as they did with gifted
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
which would be to have a
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
best practices folder so to speak
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
some definition could be achieved in
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
recording policies for example we're
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
being youtube now i think when i
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill i pointed that out
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
my words in the words
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
of all of us
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
are recorded
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
forever i guess i don't know how long
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
youtube lasts
 
01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.189 align:start position:0%
youtube lasts
so

01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh and for youngsters um
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
when we were in a covid hybrid remote
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
situation and i think representative
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
during the hearing represent nelson
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
expressed concern about you know
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
possible special ed
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
situations where where there might be
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
some unique
 
01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.830 align:start position:0%
some unique
um

01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances so um
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's it uh you know some privacy
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
issues that are part of this as well
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the second part of this the smaller
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
part had to do with classroom recordings
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh and again if you recall i talked
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
about that uh again having been in the
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
college classrooms you know most
 
01:28:05.110 --> 01:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
professors have syllabi that talk about
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
recording procedures you know i know we
 
01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.030 align:start position:0%
recording procedures you know i know we
uh

01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
some class especially like in the
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
medical field with his lectures i know
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
students like to record the lectures
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
now in the high school level uh
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
again most a lot of us have been in the
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
classroom when i was in the classroom
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
these things weren't
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous but they are now and i think
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of teachers have policies that you
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
can't you you pull out a cell phone uh
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
again this is not about any specific
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
policy we don't want to get in the weeds
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
but uh these are areas that
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh some schools i think are have
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
wonderful police policies uh developed
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
be value in sharing those
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
and you know transparency issues um the
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
the classroom visitation piece uh i i
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
think i want to thank almost every if
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
not every school already has a policy in
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
terms of who can visit a classroom even
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know during covert that was
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
during hybrid classes that was an issue
 
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.030 align:start position:0%
during hybrid classes that was an issue
because

01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
because
uh

01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
you know some parents
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know help their youngster out by
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
especially the youngster was sick if it
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
was an option to go in and get material
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
or record classes anyway these these are
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:29:17.679 --> 01:29:19.030 align:start position:0%
things that
uh

01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
i i think some of us think just need
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
attention so
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a best practices folder submit
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
a report
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
you can just send an email and uh we've
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
talked to doe about it so anyway thank
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much uh represent
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
like us do you have uh
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
anything to add um it it doesn't cost
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
anything just like the other didn't cost
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
anything it doesn't force them to do
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
anything other than file a report but
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
what it hopefully will do will cause
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
them to think about do we have a policy
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
and maybe should we have a policy it
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't even force them to have one
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
just to state what if any it is but the
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
hope is that they will develop one if
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
they don't just because it draws it to
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
their attention
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'm going to take a
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
moment here and um
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
ask that the school boards is willing to
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
come up and and take a couple questions
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
for myself
 
01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:16.709 align:start position:0%
for myself
um

01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
technical support
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
we oftentimes do this with specialists
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
that come to our exec sessions
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh becky thank you for coming
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what's the process that
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
the school boards association has in
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
policies in regard to matters which are
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
in this bill as far as
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
getting this information out to various
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
school districts and boards
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
thanks so much for the question for the
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
record becky wilson director of
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
governmental relations for new hampshire
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
school boards association
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
short short girl problems over here
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
we have about a dozen policies sample
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
policies that our member districts have
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
access to that reference
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
videoing recording surveillance
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
the difference between
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
student recordings
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
and recordings that are being used for
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
school purposes such as teacher
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation potentially
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars like drama
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
clubs or performances recordings of
 
01:31:19.990 --> 01:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
speakers so there are a number of
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
policies that districts have access to
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
that school boards can then put into
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
place some are recommended policies some
 
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
are required policies
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the visitor
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
policy we also do have a recommended
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
visitor policy sample policy that
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
districts can adopt um that all of the
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
policies we ask districts to take their
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
own lens and look at those policies and
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
really adapt them to meet the needs of
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
their individual school boards but we do
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
have a number of different policies
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
around both
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
video and audio recordings as well as
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
visitation thank you very much and i'll
 
01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:56.629 align:start position:0%
visitation thank you very much and i'll
ask

01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
one more question here and then opening
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
up if others have same
 
01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:02.310 align:start position:0%
up if others have same
requests

01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the school boards
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
association site the other evening i
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
noticed that there's three categories of
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
of how you identify them as required or
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know might be nice to have or and
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
another category statutory requirement
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
are any of the uh policies which you
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
in respect to this particular bill
 
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
there are some that are required under
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
student privacy specifically when house
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill 1558 passed a number of years ago
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
student data privacy and technology
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
privacy a lot of the surveillance
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
that school districts are using for
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
safety for student safety
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
would kind of overcross with that
 
01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
would kind of overcross with that
particular

01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
policy in terms of required student
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
privacy data privacy so there are some
 
01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
privacy data privacy so there are some
surveillance

01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
policies that districts must have in
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
terms of how they're keeping their
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
surveillance video and recordings
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
how they are being used how they cannot
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
be used in those types of issues
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
can i i just said one more in regard to
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
that statutory is there anything
 
01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.430 align:start position:0%
that statutory is there anything
statutorily

01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
established i could look through statute
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
i guess but maybe you have better handle
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
on than i
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not video is required for
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
security yeah anything that's that
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
choice says you you need to have cameras
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the playgrounds play yards in the
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
hallways etc
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's not required for you to have
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
surveillance video
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
on school district grounds
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
however is recommended and those
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
policies are recommended there is a
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
different set of policies for
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
transportation that are required in
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
terms of how the surveillance on buses
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
and things like that can be used and
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
what those pieces are required in fact i
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe that school buses are the only
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
place that video and audio
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
are required as opposed to just the
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
video surveillance is that required and
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
statutory required or just plain
 
01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
statutory required or just plain
required

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
from your policy perspective i would
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
double check on that but i believe
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're just recommended i don't believe
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
they are required
 
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
maybe the doe would have some answers in
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
that one as well the doe was here
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%

01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.189 align:start position:0%
earlier i'm not sure where they've

01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you you'll have to find

01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
are required by statute and which are
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
just recommended
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any questions
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%

thanks for having me on the policies
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
that um that that the chair was just
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
asking you about particularly the the
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
policies that are required under statute
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
um with respect to um video and audio
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh capture
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
are any of those do any of those
 
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.550 align:start position:0%
are any of those do any of those
policies

01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:02.229 align:start position:0%
policies
also

01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
also apply to
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
non-public schools that provide
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
education services to public school to
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
school districts for example a school
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
like pinkerton
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for asking it i
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
would have to double check because
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
school boards association really doesn't
 
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.229 align:start position:0%
school boards association really doesn't
represent

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:35:24.239 --> 01:35:25.669 align:start position:0%
represent
non-public

01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
school boards or any i would have to
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
double check and see which ones are
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
applicable i would imagine if the school
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
district is contracting with another
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
non-public program or another public
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
academy for example that those would
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
need to meet the same requirements as
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
the local school district
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome yes represent woodcock
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
and then represent lakes
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning good
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
morning uh
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
just a quick question about uh
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
your record-keeping association you
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
folks uh track
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
each school system and what which
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
particular policies they
 
01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:02.790 align:start position:0%
particular policies they
have

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
from you or have used or have
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
like a catalog
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
so a good man would be confused if i
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
asked you about apop
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
hello audrey if i asked if i asked you
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
about a policy uh on x you could tell me
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
these 400 schools have it thank you for
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
the question um because not every school
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
board is a member of our association we
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
don't track specifically which boards
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
have adopted which sample policies from
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
our policy manual or suggested sample
 
01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
our policy manual or suggested sample
policies

01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
because we offer them as sample policies
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
and we are hoping that each district is
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
really modifying them to meet their
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
individual district need we're not
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
keeping track of how many people uh how
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
many boards for example have adopted x
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
policy we do offer a service to
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
districts where we will do a policy
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
review of all of a district's policies
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
or school boards policies to see if that
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
up to date if they're meeting all the
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
required policies
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
how many recommended policies they've
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
taken so we have a sort of a
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know bird's eye view of what
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
districts have but we are not keeping
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
track of individual policies for each
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
district thank you so much thank you
 
01:37:11.830 --> 01:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
chairman you're welcome further question
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
i have a couple related i just had one
 
01:37:18.629 --> 01:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
but you made me think of another one
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
um the one is
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
so if a
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill were to realize that oh we don't
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
have a policy on x
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
they would easily be able to then
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
get if they said oh maybe we should do
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
that it would be an easy thing to
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
download a sample policy from you guys
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.070 align:start position:0%
is that
true

01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah policy policy services are
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
available to all of our member districts
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
so as if they were a member of our
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
association then yes they could work
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
with us to develop a policy or use our
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
sample policy and adapt it to what's
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their district
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay and if they weren't they would just
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
maybe ask another school district or
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
would it okay yes i mean it's
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
most district policies are available
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
online for school districts to community
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
members or parents or whoever wants to
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
look at policies so it's pretty
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
accessible to most people at this point
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
for people for districts to get their
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
hands on policies yes thank you very
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
much thank you are there further
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions from yes representative tanner
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um would you consider that the
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
policies that you provide
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be best practices policies because
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
they have been legally
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
perused and
 
01:38:34.239 --> 01:38:35.430 align:start position:0%
perused and
present

01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
the best opportunity for school
 
01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.709 align:start position:0%
the best opportunity for school
districts

01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we do have a
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
policy attorney specifically who looks
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
at all of our sample policies and
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
develops those in accordance with
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatever is the current statute and the
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
current requirements we do ask every
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
member district to work with their own
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
legal counsel
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
when they're looking at policies because
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
not every district is the same and we
 
01:38:58.149 --> 01:38:58.159 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that they're really
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
making a policy that's going to be
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable and appropriate for their
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
individual district but yes we work very
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
hard to make sure that all of our sample
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
policies are up to date and they get
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
updated every year after the legislative
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
session is done
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on that yes
 
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.709 align:start position:0%
follow up on that yes
so

01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
they would also be available to the
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:17.109 align:start position:0%
department of education
to

01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
publish and send out to schools if they
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
so wish right rather than perhaps having
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
each district report to the department
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
of education thank you for the question
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
i would leave that up to the department
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
of whether or not that's something that
 
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
they would want to
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
partake in in terms of working with the
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
school board's association on individual
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
policies that's really something the
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
department would have to weigh in on
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome further question
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
you very much for uh for taking another
 
01:39:50.149 --> 01:39:50.159 align:start position:0%
question becky um what um what your
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
your answer to representative tanner's
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
sort of piqued
 
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
an interest
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
in what this bill is all about and and
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative moffat refers to this
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill as being about the department
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
collecting of having a folder of best
 
01:40:10.159 --> 01:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
collecting of having a folder of best
practices

01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
to observer policies and audio video
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
streaming and recording policies
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
and given what you just said about how
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
the school board association develops
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
model policies that are that are
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
that are developed with them
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
by an attorney
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
but then recommend
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
each school district to consult with
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
their own attorney
 
01:40:40.870 --> 01:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
on um on the unique needs
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics and and obviously
 
01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:44.950 align:start position:0%
characteristics and and obviously
um

01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
you know their own their own school
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
board attorney is the one that
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
represents the school board uh if uh if
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
this is ever ever put to a challenge
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
that um would would would this folder
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
really truly be a best practices folder
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
or would it really be a collection of
 
01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
policies that uh that have now been
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
passed by various school boards may
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
differ by school board depending upon
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
what their unique circumstances are and
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
what their own school board attorney
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
may recommend
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
collecting any kind of copies of
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
policies or things like that i
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know who would vet what is
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
considered a best practice policy versus
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
what is collecting the policies that
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
currently exist um you know there's
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly ways to make sure that every
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
policy meets whatever is the
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
requirements if there is a particular
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
requirement for a certain policy to
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that your policy aligns with
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
what's required
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's considered best
 
01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.830 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's considered best
practice

01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:41:45.270 --> 01:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who would be making that
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
determination or what the definition of
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
that would be specific to surveillance
 
01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
and video
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
policies or classroom visitation
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up mr chair yes um so would
 
01:41:56.639 --> 01:41:57.350 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up mr chair yes um so would
a

01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
what a what a policy for um
 
01:42:00.639 --> 01:42:02.229 align:start position:0%
what a what a policy for um
for

01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:42:04.550 --> 01:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
observer policies audio video streaming
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
recording policies that are adopted in
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
let's say salem
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
the um the ideal
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
um for um
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
for let's say newport
 
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i every
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
district is individual and i believe
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
that it's really up to the district to
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that whatever policies they're
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
putting in place are going to work for
 
01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:25.750 align:start position:0%
putting in place are going to work for
their

01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
particular district and their particular
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
needs um
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
what's best for one district is not
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be best for every
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
district it's quite different if you
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
have you know 10 buildings in your
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
district versus a one k to two school or
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
something i mean there's very different
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh reasons to have
 
01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
different policies for different
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
districts and that's why we do not
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
just hand out cookie cutter policies and
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
say you know just fill in these blanks
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're expecting that districts are
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
working with their own school boards to
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
develop policies that are going to work
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thanks for taking
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
my question uh ms wilson
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
so in these policies that you have this
 
01:43:09.669 --> 01:43:09.679 align:start position:0%
this particular bill deals with
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
classroom recordings and in classroom
 
01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
classroom recordings and in classroom
observers

01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
observers
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
do any of the policies that you have
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
take into consideration in classroom
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
observers or
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
do you have separate policies for those
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
two aspects of eyes in the classroom
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we have
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
separate policies
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
in fact even the videoing and the
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
recording policies are dif there's a
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
number of different ones there's one
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
surveillance for safety purposes there's
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
a separate
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
aspect of that that is for if teachers
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
are using recordings in the classroom
 
01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
for their own professional development
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
there's aspects of recording by students
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's in the student handbook that's
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
recommended to go into student handbooks
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
about what students can
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
cannot record or what purposes they can
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
and cannot record
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know district policy speaks
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
specifically about using district
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
equipment to record versus using
 
01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
personal equipment
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
those are all very separate from
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
visitation or observation
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
and again i think there is also a
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
difference between visiting a classroom
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
and having someone come in to observe a
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
classroom with a particular purpose
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
there's a there are also very different
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
reasons for those kinds of visitations
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
and those are spelled out in different
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
policies it's
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know school visitors is quite
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
different than an outside person who's
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
coming in to observe for a particular
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
purpose perhaps for a teacher who's
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
going through a higher ed program and
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
they need to be observed etc those are
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question um do you encourage
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
school districts to um
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
disclose those policies in the
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate cases in other words if
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
someone comes in and they're videotaping
 
01:45:00.719 --> 01:45:02.229 align:start position:0%
someone comes in and they're videotaping
or

01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
you know just like here it's announced
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
when the videotaping is begin so
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware that they're being
 
01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:09.830 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware that they're being
videotaped

01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
videotaped
 
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
do you encourage those
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
policies to be
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know either written or spoken to
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
the people that they affect thank you
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
depending on the purpose of the
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
observation or the visit those policies
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
would absolutely be disclosed to the
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
person that's coming in um you know
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
certainly classroom visitors there's a
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
procedure that needs to be in place in
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
every building or in every classroom and
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
every school that that is made aware to
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
people who are coming in to visit the
 
01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:37.430 align:start position:0%
people who are coming in to visit the
school

01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
if people are coming in to observe then
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
yes they would need to
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
be given that policy or at least be made
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
aware of whatever the policy is in terms
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
of recordings
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
there are references to specific
 
01:45:48.719 --> 01:45:50.149 align:start position:0%
there are references to specific
recording

01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
recording
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
policies in the student handbook excuse
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
me that students and parents sign off on
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's also a video release that
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
parents sign every single year either
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
they allow their child to be videoed or
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
not and released that happens every
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
single year so those are all part of
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
making sure that people are aware of the
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of why things are
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
recorded or videotaped and how they will
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
be used and parents have the right to
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
do you know if um and i'm it's not
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily your purview so you may not
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
know but
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
do do the charter schools um
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
that are also public schools uh do you
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
know if they
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
also have policies written and and um
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
encouraged to you know have in student
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
handbooks and that sort of thing
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i don't know
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
specifically what charter schools are
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
required to have in terms of their
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
student handbooks or things like that
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you becky
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
for taking this
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
this bill requires um
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
school districts to
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
submit a report to the department of
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
education concerning the policy are
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
there other policies that you know of
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
that are requi it's a requirement that
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
school districts submit them to the
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i do know
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
last year when they passed the bill in
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
this committee in terms of required
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
they're not required policies but that
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
if you had a policy regarding your
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
programming for gifted students that
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
that would be sent to the department and
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
the department would hold those in a
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
folder at the department
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
there aren't safety policies and safety
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
plans and things like that that need to
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
be filed with the department but they
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
are not specific policies to my
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge but again that would be a
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
further questions representative wood
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you it's for
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's not for ms wilson for
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative wafflet i'll
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
um just a question of representative
 
01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
um just a question of representative
moffat

01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
moffat
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
looking back on the notes of january
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
27th when you made the initial
 
01:48:05.119 --> 01:48:06.629 align:start position:0%
27th when you made the initial
presentation

01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
and you described it then as you did
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
today mike that this is a best practice
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
similar to the gift and talented one
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that you passed before but as i listen
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
to the discussion today
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear to be any best
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
practice scenario this is just a
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
seminar policy which could be
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
it has no value it doesn't have it
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the same
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
incentive for schools to go look at this
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
where they
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate public schools because they
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
can already get the policies through the
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
school board or they already have one
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand the the
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
connection between best practice and
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
just submitting a policy to a file where
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's they're all pretty much
 
01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
there's they're all pretty much
standardized

01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
standardized
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure that's a great question and uh
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative asked a good question too
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh best practices i use that term on the
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
27th i guess and today uh use it with a
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
gifted bill but as becky pointed out uh
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
in response to uh representative luna's
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
question it's it's
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the term best practices maybe i
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't use that today it's a just a
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
centralized policy
 
01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.990 align:start position:0%
centralized policy
uh

01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
folder if you will for people to
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
see what other districts are doing and
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
what's what might work for them so yeah
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
best practices uh
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
is not part of the language of the
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
statute and
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know it probably doesn't
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
i probably
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
didn't need to use best practices if it
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
confused anybody yeah it's a policy
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh having worked for the department of
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
education for 41 years
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
i i have yet to see
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
a best practice
 
01:49:50.229 --> 01:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
folder or policy folder which had any
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
significant impact on education in the
 
01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:54.390 align:start position:0%
significant impact on education in the
state

01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
i think as a committee we need to be
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
very very careful and this comes up from
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
time to time
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
that well let's go ahead and try this
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
this won't hurt so let's see if it will
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
work and i think we we add those things
 
01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
in to the department of ed it's just
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
another thing there which in it
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately doesn't work so i'll be
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're okay here
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.629 align:start position:0%
we're here
testing

01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
this one seems to be working
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
so i have two observations one is
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative lycus uh lucas i'm going
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
to get this right said that this doesn't
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
cost anything that's just wrong it costs
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
every school district money to produce
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
these reports and to say it doesn't cost
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
anything just because it's not a line
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
item thing it is costing districts money
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
and we need to be aware that every time
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
we do one of these from on high kind of
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
policies the second observation i have
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
is that i can't understand why we're
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
doing this it's not like people are
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to be coming and pulling those
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
folders and looking at them other than
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps the department of education
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
which is trying to play big brother from
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
my point of view they want to know what
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
people are doing so they can try and
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
regulate it we are all about local
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
control if we're about local control why
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
are we doing this why are we collecting
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
these policies why are we playing big
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
brother and frankly why this may be
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
slightly intimidating about what is our
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
policy what do we want to tell the state
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think we should be
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
playing local control i don't think we
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
should be putting these kinds of
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
requirements on a district just for the
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
sake of having these requirements i
 
01:52:46.229 --> 01:52:46.239 align:start position:0%
think we ought to think long and hard
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
things it sure does
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr uh sure uh just on the
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
on the money issue i do agree with
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative leckus uh
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the in terms of
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
reports or policies i think most schools
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
already have a wait till representative
 
01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:22.310 align:start position:0%
already have a wait till representative
wales

01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative i want to make
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
sure episodes could hear me trying to
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
answer her question um
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
yes uh the the part of this about
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
classroom visitations for example i
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
think most if not all districts have
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
something in place if there's some that
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't then this is a chance for them to
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
pay some attention to it in terms of
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
money i agree with representative lekkis
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think this would most cases involve
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
an administrative assistant sending an
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
email and an attachment to doe uh it
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
would take a minute i think in most
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
cases as i as many of us see that and i
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
also wanted to just respond a little bit
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
to representative allison um becky in
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
terms of policies going to doa becky
 
01:54:15.199 --> 01:54:16.629 align:start position:0%
terms of policies going to doa becky
wilson

01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
wilson
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
cited a couple other examples for
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
example safety protocols you know does
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
asking for reports on a number of things
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
for followers if you will she cited
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
safety protocols i think there's value
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
to those you know like you're saying
 
01:54:32.790 --> 01:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
that you didn't see the value in
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
in collecting such things you know
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
obviously i i do
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to respond to that
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
as well thank you representative
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
taking my questions and comments uh
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
01:54:52.629 --> 01:54:52.639 align:start position:0%
so were you surprised as i was surprised
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
to listen to the
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
list of subcategories of recordings and
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
just how many aspects of recording
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
sure in fact um
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's if i can say this uh
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
some of you that's the beauty of the
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
measure like this
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
is that uh just this taken a little bit
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
longer than maybe we thought it would
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
but all the
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
discus the points and discussion that's
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
flowing from this
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh proposed measure
 
01:55:30.550 --> 01:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what you just mentioned
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh being surprised
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
being surprised at what's out there
 
01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.189 align:start position:0%
being surprised at what's out there
again

01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
please this is not a policy mandate
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's what kind of slowed down the
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
gifted bill for a while because people
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
were saying what about this or about
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
that what about this one about that what
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
about surveillance about that that's not
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill again uh the
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to collect data and
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
encourage districts to have in some
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
cases overdue discussions particularly
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
post covent again very simple and so i i
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
get down in the weeds that's not the
 
01:56:04.719 --> 01:56:05.910 align:start position:0%
get down in the weeds that's not the
intent

01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yeah i was just as i
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
listened to
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
ms wilson discuss it it in my own mind
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
went from one report to two
 
01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
one report being on recordings and a
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
second report
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
on ins in classroom observers
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
and it went from what was being
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
described as
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know a super easy 30-second thing
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
to a report out on
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
eight different aspects of recording in
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
a classroom whether it's students
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
recording teachers recording
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
the teacher being recorded student
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
privacy issues uh
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
so i mean obviously miss wilson had the
 
01:56:51.599 --> 01:56:52.709 align:start position:0%
so i mean obviously miss wilson had the
list

01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
of things so i was surprised at that it
 
01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
seems that it's much more involved
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
than i had
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
initially read into the bill and in your
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented uh bill i'm looking
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
at it there's a section uh three that
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
says that the department shall develop a
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
standardized format for submission
 
01:57:14.719 --> 01:57:15.990 align:start position:0%
standardized format for submission
uh

01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
that and reassess it each year and and
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
whatever was it your intention that the
 
01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:22.629 align:start position:0%
whatever was it your intention that the
department

01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
developed some sort of a format for this
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
report as well
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
if i may respond mr chair yeah sure
 
01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
if i may respond mr chair yeah sure
uh

01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
yes uh the department you mentioned the
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
gift of bill the department uh we met
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
with them they actually did
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
develop a format
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
the d.o.e dead which they promulgated
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
and sent out so that the districts would
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
have a way to respond
 
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
and you make a good point
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
in that as i said i think with the
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
visitation perceive policies that those
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
probably in place and fairly easy to
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
respond to but you're right uh
 
01:58:00.639 --> 01:58:01.830 align:start position:0%
respond to but you're right uh
because

01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the audio visual recording domain
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's a new and i think a needed area
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
that needs
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and attention
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh that could take a
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
considerable time depends on the
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
district and whoever is there at the
 
01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:16.950 align:start position:0%
district and whoever is there at the
district

01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
if if they end up spending um
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know various amounts of time on it
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
that it's good obviously it shows us a
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
need to spend some time uh and get some
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
definition uh locally on uh what their
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
policies are and to and to be asked or
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
required to submit a report to doe
 
01:58:38.070 --> 01:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
provides the impetus for this discussion
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
locally that yeah i
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
think needs to happen
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
one one more follow-up okay just one
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
more go ahead i promise um so
 
01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:50.470 align:start position:0%
more go ahead i promise um so
representative

01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
the doe involvement in
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
in uh developing the report format is
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
not in this bill it was in the gifted
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
and talented bill but it's not in this
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill was that your intention is there a
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
reason why it's not in the bill
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
sure good question and uh
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
several of us did meet with several
 
01:59:13.990 --> 01:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
folks at doe and they like the idea of
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
this and i guess it's implied that doe
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
would without getting too detailed and
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and how they respond to the
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
statute i i'm sure they would
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
similarly to the gifted bill
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide some guidance in in terms of how
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
to submit the
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
data or the report well it's in statute
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the gifted
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill correct
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a few moments to just
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
give a couple options i got to go on at
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
a teleconference meeting at 11 o'clock
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh regarding higher ed
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh i i i asked a question that
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
why is this specific to in classroom
 
01:59:58.870 --> 01:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh when in fact
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
the whole school is a classroom
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
from the cafeteria to the
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
pe area the multi-purpose room to the
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
music room to the art facilities it's
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
all classroom including
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
small conference rooms which are used
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
for supplemental education or remedial
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
education what have you we use every
 
02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:19.669 align:start position:0%
education what have you we use every
space

02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
space
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
but my concern that you know
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
i could understand gathering this
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
information if it were for a specific
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and the specific purpose would
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'd love to see
 
02:00:34.229 --> 02:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
deals with emergency management planning
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
which we now know we have to submit this
 
02:00:38.070 --> 02:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
information directly to homeland
 
02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:39.270 align:start position:0%
information directly to homeland
security

02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
security
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
then over to the department of education
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
we dealt with that already this year
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
i'd love to know if i'd really not love
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
to know but i appreciate knowing if the
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
we have that streaming capability
 
02:00:53.599 --> 02:00:55.189 align:start position:0%
we have that streaming capability
available

02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:00:55.199 --> 02:00:56.149 align:start position:0%
available
in

02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:57.910 --> 02:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
throughout our schools
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
which then it can be also seen on the
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
responder on their screen in their
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle whether it be the sheriff the
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
police state troopers police etc what's
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
going on in the school in case of
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of an issue within the school
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
i see a real positive behind that and
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
the rationale for that
 
02:01:17.119 --> 02:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
the rationale for that
um

02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
so but as far as in classroom itself
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
i know we need to have policies and how
 
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
everything in regard to education it's
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's just the way we live
 
02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:31.990 align:start position:0%
it's just the way we live
but

02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
but
it's

02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
to me curriculum and instruction becomes
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
a local responsibility
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't see why this can't be
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
handled on the local level that's where
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
where i am
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i got to leave right now i'm going to
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
hand this over to represent cordelia
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
i've got to get on the phone in the
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
other room i'll be right back
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to any voting or et
 
02:01:54.159 --> 02:01:58.950 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to any voting or et
cetera

02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair and um
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
and you know i think that obviously
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
we're having uh i think quite an
 
02:02:11.109 --> 02:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
in-depth discussion and uh with with
 
02:02:11.119 --> 02:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
in-depth discussion and uh with with
with

02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:13.589 --> 02:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
also with technical support from school
 
02:02:13.599 --> 02:02:14.470 align:start position:0%
also with technical support from school
board

02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
association and maybe from the
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
department of ed but oh yeah um
 
02:02:21.669 --> 02:02:21.679 align:start position:0%
so i think there's i think there's a lot
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
of questions um with respect to
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
to to this
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
i know i would like to learn um maybe
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
more about
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
from the department how
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
how school districts would uh would
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
would be able to access this um this
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
best practices folder so that they could
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the information there
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
and and and how the department is going
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
to make that available that data
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
available to um to school districts um
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
in a useful productive um
 
02:02:54.639 --> 02:02:55.589 align:start position:0%
in a useful productive um
manner

02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:02:55.599 --> 02:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
manner
that

02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
that that also identifies maybe why
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
certain school districts do it one way
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
and other school districts do another
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
way for some of the reasons why
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
that that ms wilson um brought up
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:03:13.830 --> 02:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i'd also like to
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
maybe understand a little bit more from
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
the department's perspective
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh what their costs of of doing this
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
operation you know
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
to make that data available
 
02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's obviously local costs of
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
compiling um uh data and sending it to
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
the uh to the department then there's
 
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
the department's data in collecting this
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
i mean the department's costs and
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
collecting this data from
 
02:03:39.599 --> 02:03:40.830 align:start position:0%
collecting this data from
what

02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
220 um
 
02:03:43.199 --> 02:03:44.550 align:start position:0%
220 um
schools

02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
and um and and and processing that
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then and then finally i think from
 
02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:50.550 align:start position:0%
and then and then finally i think from
the

02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
from a
 
02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
school's you know perspective
 
02:03:55.510 --> 02:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
the um uh
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
and this gets to i think to chair lad's
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
recent comment that that schools have
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
policies for everything well they don't
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily need policies for everything
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
they need policies they require policies
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we require in statute those are the
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
required uh policies
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh policies that they adopt beyond that
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
are are because they're
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
the school board and the members of the
 
02:04:22.159 --> 02:04:23.669 align:start position:0%
the school board and the members of the
community

02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
want to be able to hold the school
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
district uh accountable to making sure
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
that they follow those policies and
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
and that's very likely why uh while a
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
lot of policies that ms wilson was
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
talking about and especially the
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
policies with respect to audio video
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
streaming and recording
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
and in classroom
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
where they're not required have been
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
adopted by
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
by school districts so um
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
so i i guess i you know would it be
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
possible to hear from the the department
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
with respect to what their plans are
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh and would be with this and how this
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be valuable to
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
schools would attorney fenton
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
care to provide any technical support on
 
02:05:11.599 --> 02:05:12.709 align:start position:0%
care to provide any technical support on
this

02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:12.719 --> 02:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
this
legislation

02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
well you could you could get a promotion
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
hope springs
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
field a field field promotion there you
 
02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:34.229 align:start position:0%
field a field field promotion there you
go

02:05:34.229 --> 02:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
from the department's perspective and my
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of the testimony and the
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
intent from the sponsor
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
what is before this committee is very
 
02:05:49.750 --> 02:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
similar to the legislation that was
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
brought forward last session
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to gifted and talented
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
policies and my understanding is that
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
the department has implemented that
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
legislation um by creating it was an
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
electronic folder i know last session
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of debate as to whether
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
or not it would be an actual
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
paper folder or it would be electronic
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i think there was an amendment in
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
the senate to make um
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i know in speaking with
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner the intent and the
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
thought was
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
we'll have it
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
on our website available for
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
for public inspection and consumption to
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
just go and look at those policies and
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
that was the discussion and the intent
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and to facilitate that my understanding
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
is that the department i know met with
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt to create a form
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
to streamline that so that there would
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
be that consistency across the board
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
because i know some of the discussion
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
was you will have some discrepancies or
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies from one district to
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
another and so i think to just
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
facilitate ease of readership
 
02:06:51.119 --> 02:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
facilitate ease of readership
um

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
a form was developed and i would
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate the department would take a
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
similar approach if this bill were were
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
to be passed by this legislative body
 
02:07:04.390 --> 02:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of the cost
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
as this
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
as this committee well knows there are
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
some bills that come forward which would
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
add a considerable cost
 
02:07:15.990 --> 02:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the department we need new staff
 
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.149 align:start position:0%
to the department we need new staff
etc

02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
etc
 
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
based on the plane reading of this this
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
is a bill that similar to last year's
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill can be incorporated with the state
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
we can create that form as we did last
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
time and put it up on our website for
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
public consumption and so we do not
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there would be a
 
02:07:35.840 --> 02:07:37.109 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there would be a
significant

02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
cost associated with it but again that's
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
from the department's perspective i am
 
02:07:43.669 --> 02:07:43.679 align:start position:0%
not speaking on behalf of the districts
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
which you also alluded to we're not in a
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
position to talk about that particular
 
02:07:48.159 --> 02:07:50.069 align:start position:0%
position to talk about that particular
cost

02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative tanner
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know as i'm i'm thinking about this
 
02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and particularly with what uh
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative lad chair lad spoke about
 
02:07:59.599 --> 02:08:00.390 align:start position:0%
representative lad chair lad spoke about
how

02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
the whole school's a classroom and then
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
we talked about the different types of
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
of video that's been taken
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we want
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
streaming video of schools
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
for security purposes i'm sure homeland
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps the policies but once you
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
establish the policies it may give
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to use
 
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.629 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to use
videotapes

02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
videotapes
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
for not particularly great reasons
 
02:08:37.599 --> 02:08:39.270 align:start position:0%
for not particularly great reasons
um

02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
access uh to information that they
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
um i see
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know when i asked the school boards
 
02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
association about um
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
do they post the the policies
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh certainly here we hear you know okay
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're being recorded now um we don't
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
know the policies other than it's going
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
to be on youtube uh representative
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
moffat doesn't even know how long
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
the youtube lasts neither do i right um
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how those
 
02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:12.709 align:start position:0%
and we don't know how those
uh

02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
videotapes can be used um
 
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
for against us i guess is is probably
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
um or even to come in and
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
take over this building for that matter
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
so um i think it's this although this
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
sounds really simple you know really
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
easy really like this is a good thing
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going to spark good things i
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
think it already has sparked good things
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
probably from people listening in and
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
and and that sort of thing i don't i
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
think we need to take a step back i
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
really do i think we need to
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
think about the ramifications and
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
security purposes
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
in schools um
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're videotapes you know and security
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
tapes and
 
02:09:58.950 --> 02:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
all kinds of tapes have been you know
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
video has been taken so
 
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:03.350 align:start position:0%
video has been taken so
um

02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's a question to you
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
or just it's a comment in my mind about
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
do you see
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
probably from your legal standpoint
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
how this might
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
mushroom into something more than what
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
we really want it to be and maybe needs
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.280 --> 02:10:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of your question opened
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
up my book to 194b uh
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
charter schools and i am disappointed
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
that it has nothing to do with charter
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
schools so i i was trying to be there
 
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
with you and i i
 
02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:42.870 align:start position:0%
with you and i i
[Laughter]

02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:45.109 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
so

02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think any bill that is passed any bill
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
that is reviewed and this committee
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
knows this better than i do could have
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
potential um
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.669 --> 02:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is obviously an area of of great
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
concern as to whether or not
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill should be studied further
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's not for me to decide that's for
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
this body to decide um
 
02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
on on its face
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
the way it is currently written
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:20.790 align:start position:0%
it is
it

02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
it is a bill
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the department can easily implement
 
02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
the implications of that
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
discuss previously
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
the law 194b explicitly states
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
that and i forget the provision that i
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
sent you the other day but it does say
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
in here in two places
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
that unless stated in other areas of the
 
02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
that unless stated in other areas of the
law

02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
that the charter school bill uh charter
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
school law rather the chapter is very
 
02:11:55.990 --> 02:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
so the way i read this
 
02:11:58.639 --> 02:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
so the way i read this
in

02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
in context with 194b
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
is that unless it explicitly states this
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
is to apply to charter schools
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
it would not just
 
02:12:12.390 --> 02:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
so happens i have an amendment for that
 
02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to make a motion on an
 
02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.149 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to make a motion on an
amendment

02:12:16.149 --> 02:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay we have
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
an emotion on the floor we have
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
additional questions of the department
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
if we could take care of that first you
 
02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:23.669 align:start position:0%
if we could take care of that first you
may

02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'm not exactly sure
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
if this is for you
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
or if it's for representative moffat
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but i'm i'm questioning why i and i i
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
apologize because i was not here the day
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the hearing on this bill so i didn't
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of hearing everything
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
that was said then
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering why we are doing this
 
02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:47.589 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering why we are doing this
and

02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
school districts shall develop a policy
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
02:12:57.840 --> 02:12:59.589 align:start position:0%
dealing with
this

02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
and let it happen the way it had all the
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
other policies happened by the school
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
boards association and that sort of
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
thing why are we getting
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
this the department of education
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
to collect these policies i
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
and would we be starting a process where
 
02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
and would we be starting a process where
um

02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education now has to
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
start collecting the policies of
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
playground use or bus
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
procedures or all these other ish areas
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
where schools have policies
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
i guess am i making sense why are we
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
making the department of education even
 
02:13:43.350 --> 02:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
be a conduit for this
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if that's
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
probably not for you representative
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
moffat's not listening so maybe you're
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
the one that's going to need to answer
 
02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:53.030 align:start position:0%
the one that's going to need to answer
it

02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know represent
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a response attorney fenton
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
um i i do and i understand your question
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
in large part i will refer to the
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill but my
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
understanding and i don't want to speak
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
for you obviously but my understanding
 
02:14:08.550 --> 02:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
was there was a thought in in the bill
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year is related to
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
gifted and talented students was to have
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
not a clearing house but a centralized
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
location is probably the better term a
 
02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
centralized location where districts
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
could access
 
02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
information as to how other districts
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
are handling the situation and i think
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
that was the intent
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
on this bill as well same idea same
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
concept different topic but again i will
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
i will refer to representative moffat on
 
02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:36.390 align:start position:0%
i will refer to representative moffat on
that

02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh if i may
 
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes attorney fenton uh described that
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
very well and and your question about
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know playground policies i mean that
 
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question too
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
um the reason
 
02:14:50.079 --> 02:14:51.030 align:start position:0%
um the reason
that

02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
i or the folks at sport are gifted or
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
wanted it to come through this process
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
is that the imprimatur of legislative
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
action of statutory action matter
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
matters uh we think
 
02:15:07.830 --> 02:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
the commission can send a memo out
 
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
and ask for
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh policies and that's
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
just not it doesn't have the gravitas or
 
02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
the import that that uh
 
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
the imprimatur of legislative action has
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
because this is i obviously think this
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
is really important and uh and this
 
02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:26.149 align:start position:0%
is really important and uh and this
legislative

02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
action uh underscores the importance of
 
02:15:28.719 --> 02:15:31.109 align:start position:0%
action uh underscores the importance of
it

02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.229 --> 02:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah i understand that but
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we're not you
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
should be awesome
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
is this attorney fenton i would like to
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
finish up with the questions to attorney
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
fenton first
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative mullen
 
02:15:46.149 --> 02:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelian thank
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question diana
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
so 189 29b
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
which is the gifted and talented statute
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
that was added last year
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
has three distinct sections
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
the first is a definition of gifted and
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
talented should this bill be identical
 
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
to that bill perhaps a a definition of
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
what in classroom
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
recordings or observers are
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
might have appeared there the second is
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
the second session roman two is the
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
requirement to file the report
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
and then roman three is the uh
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
directive to the department of education
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
that says that they will develop the
 
02:16:31.679 --> 02:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
that says that they will develop the
format

02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
format
 
02:16:35.910 --> 02:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
my question to you is this
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
is that gifted and talented bill as a
 
02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.150 align:start position:0%
is that gifted and talented bill as a
model

02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
more

02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.230 align:start position:0%
more
directive

02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
directive
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
than the bill that we have in front of
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
us there is no definition there is no
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
directive to the department of ed to
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
develop the format we keep comparing the
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
two bills but when i look at 189 29b
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
i see something very different than
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
what's in front of us in house bill 1295
 
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
what's in front of us in house bill 1295
and

02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what your take is on that
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's thank you for the
 
02:17:16.230 --> 02:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
question it's a very astute observation
 
02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
question it's a very astute observation
and

02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:18.230 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
the department will respond to what is
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
passed and what is printed and so if
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
that is the intent of this body to have
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
it be similar um in the ways that we
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
have described then it would certainly
 
02:17:32.709 --> 02:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
behoove this committee to structure it
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
in a similar manner
 
02:17:34.559 --> 02:17:35.990 align:start position:0%
in a similar manner
um

02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
so yes i think that would be that would
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
be helpful in terms of the directive to
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
the department as to what the
 
02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
expectation is
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton um representative nelson
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm curious as to
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
how much data
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
your department collects it seems like
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
in this whole place everybody's
 
02:17:57.589 --> 02:17:57.599 align:start position:0%
collecting something and they got a book
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
this thing
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
how much types of data do they collect
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
and you know this is this just a drop of
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
the department
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
the department does collect
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of of information
 
02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:17.470 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of of information
um

02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.030 align:start position:0%
um

[Music]
 
02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
i joked recently with commissioner
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
edelblut and he said sometimes it's just
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats being bureaucrats
 
02:18:26.070 --> 02:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
acting bureaucratically i think was his
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
term and collecting information and so i
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
think you know when we looked at the
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill that representative moffat brought
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
up uh last session
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and we appreciate his openness to
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
modifying his bill last session there
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
was a concern that it would just become
 
02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:44.070 align:start position:0%
was a concern that it would just become
another

02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
paper and a folder um and so i think
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
when we pivoted a little bit
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
and revamped it to put it in a set
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
format working closely with the
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
department to create this form and put
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
it on the on the website so that it
 
02:19:03.509 --> 02:19:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
it became more accessible for people and
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
it and it was less about the department
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
just collecting
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
more information in more paper um that
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
is always a concern of the departments
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
we successfully i think last year's
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
session taught certainly me in the
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
department that we were able to work and
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
to achieve the representatives goals and
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
to cut back on that
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
collection piece just for collecting
 
02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:29.270 align:start position:0%
collection piece just for collecting
purposes

02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
but yes
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
in a short answer yes the department
 
02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:33.190 align:start position:0%
in a short answer yes the department
collects

02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
collects
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of information
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
and it's all passed statutorily
 
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
were there any further questions i
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
thought i saw another hand
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh not seen any thank you
 
02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:46.389 align:start position:0%
uh not seen any thank you
um

02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
miss fenton it's hard to know what to
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you as a former prosecutor i
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
have been called a lot worse so i i
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if we called her
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
ambassador we might have to send her
 
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative hopson
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
i believe i might have been out the week
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill was presented and
 
02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:18.150 align:start position:0%
that this bill was presented and
i

02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going back and forth on this bill
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
but i
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
something has
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
i wanted to present to the committee
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's kind of made its way to my head
 
02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:28.950 align:start position:0%
it's kind of made its way to my head
today

02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
in this air in this era of uh
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
recordings and remote
 
02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
recordings and remote
um

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
i have really benefited from
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
the house education committee receptacle
 
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.830 align:start position:0%
the house education committee receptacle
for

02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
videos and you know in preparing
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
testimony for bills
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
going back you know i could look at a
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill today and say oh my gosh i don't
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
remember anything about that bill i go
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
back to the recording
 
02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i and i listen to it and i am
 
02:21:00.309 --> 02:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
brought right back to that day and my
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
feelings and my thoughts on the bill
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
i don't think we've talked about that
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
here today and the difference between
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
watching a recording in a classroom as a
 
02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:11.190 align:start position:0%
watching a recording in a classroom as a
student

02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
and being in a zoom class
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
to me those are completely different um
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
i can watch the recording when it when
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for me when i can hear it
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
and absorb it versus being in a zoom
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
and worrying about what you know susie
 
02:21:28.309 --> 02:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
is saying and you know the phone's
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
ringing and my kids need food or
 
02:21:30.319 --> 02:21:31.429 align:start position:0%
ringing and my kids need food or
whatever

02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
um so i that's
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
as a as a just a receptacle and again
 
02:21:36.319 --> 02:21:37.270 align:start position:0%
as a as a just a receptacle and again
i'm

02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
i don't want to profess to know all the
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
things that this bill covers but i think
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's important to
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
think about it from that aspect and some
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the bills that we're listening to
 
02:21:48.790 --> 02:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
for remote
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
um that's all i wanted to say thank you
 
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:51.830 align:start position:0%
um that's all i wanted to say thank you
um

02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative lagas excuse me
 
02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative porter you i think you
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
had a question that you wanted to uh
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
submit to
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
representative moffat
 
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for remembering mr chair
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
and guess what the question that i had
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
was why is this going to the department
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
of education why are we setting
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
school districts up for being watched
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
over so carefully by the department of
 
02:22:17.590 --> 02:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
education when we could just
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
put in statute that
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
districts shall develop a policy having
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
to do with these things and then allow
 
02:22:27.030 --> 02:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
them to do it
 
02:22:29.830 --> 02:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's in statute um the school boards
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
association has their lawyers that would
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
help them it would get done because it
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
would be required by statute but it
 
02:22:39.030 --> 02:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't force the school districts to
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
submit these
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
reports to the department of education
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
to be overlooked and what's the next
 
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
thing they're going to have to send into
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
the department of education and the next
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
thing and the next thing and pretty soon
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the department becomes the overseer of
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
all these individual policies from
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
individual districts
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
it feels
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
pardon my usage but it feels a little
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
bit like big brother to me we're setting
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
the department up to be watching over
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
very carefully every aspect of what goes
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
on in the local districts and maybe you
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
know maybe we want to do that but i
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
sure thanks for the comment i mentioned
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
earlier that uh the reason for
 
02:23:26.070 --> 02:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
going this route through doe in the
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislative process as i said before um
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
is a way to uh
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of this
 
02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:36.150 align:start position:0%
underscore the importance of this
evolving

02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
evolving
 
02:23:39.670 --> 02:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
issue with with technology and yeah i am
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
not big on reports uh unless unless
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
ones that that you know uh
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
i think or we think make a difference i
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
think gifted definitely has made a
 
02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:49.990 align:start position:0%
think gifted definitely has made a
difference

02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
difference
every

02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:23:52.630 --> 02:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
all of us say no people are talking
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
about districts are talking about uh you
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
know developing gifted policies which is
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
the intent of that
 
02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:00.230 align:start position:0%
the intent of that
um

02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
i hear your point and i i would not want
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
to overburden them but i think there are
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
some things that are reasonable to
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
expect uh from the doe and from
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
districts and
 
02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
districts and
uh

02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
do um and this is this is really a
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
question to you um mr chair do we know
 
02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
if homeland security is weighed in on
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
on the framework and development of
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
audio video capture and dissemination
 
02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:34.950 align:start position:0%
audio video capture and dissemination
policies

02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
and what sort of impact that could have
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
not just
 
02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
on student safety
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
but uh but beyond that in terms of um um
 
02:24:47.349 --> 02:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm forgetting the term that uh that
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
the homeland security
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh that the representative from homeland
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
security used here recently but um but
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh situational situational management
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and things like that well on in regard
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
to the emergency response plans when we
 
02:25:04.070 --> 02:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
had the 30 million dollars which we are
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
distributing the schools for security
 
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:06.870 align:start position:0%
distributing the schools for security
measures

02:25:06.870 --> 02:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
measures
 
02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:08.630 align:start position:0%
measures
upgrading

02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
upgrading
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
we do know that we do have the streaming
 
02:25:14.230 --> 02:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
available in some schools it's not all
 
02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
available in some schools it's not all
schools

02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
and cameras was one of the issues which
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
we were purchasing
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then of course looking at the
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
placement of cameras and in the entry
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
areas in the access and egress areas
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
but we do not have any policy that
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
requires these to be in place
 
02:25:31.830 --> 02:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
um or for schools to have them so and we
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
don't have this information that's why i
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
was keenly interested if this was
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
applying to the whole school and whether
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
we could get information as a result of
 
02:25:39.750 --> 02:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
something like this but i don't think
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to provide that to us in
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
that regard
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so emergency management response
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
emergency response planning
 
02:25:50.790 --> 02:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
is important and uh i feel that an issue
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we as need to be starting to talk
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
with the director over there homeland
 
02:25:58.230 --> 02:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
with her over homeland security and with
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
and just because we have these plans
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
identified in stash doesn't mean we have
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
it totally worked out yet we did do the
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
task forces and i i saw represent tanner
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
looking at that booklet the other day i
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
was doing the same thing
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
and uh it doesn't mention you know in
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
the recommendations to the back for
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislative improvements and
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations i have not seen one that
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
recommends that we have the that
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
streaming video capability uh in all our
 
02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:29.670 align:start position:0%
streaming video capability uh in all our
schools

02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
something we may want to pursue so my my
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
concern mr chair is that if schools if
 
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
some schools um therefore need to make
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh make it publicly known
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
beyond the mere absence of a um that
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
would be a mistake if we did that navy
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
policy yeah that they made it known that
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have any recordings or
 
02:26:52.309 --> 02:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
recording capabilities one of the
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why we've had difficulty at the
 
02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
very start of this program
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
when director plummer at that time was
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
doing all the digitizing over there at
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
homeland security on the other side of
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
concord here is that school districts
 
02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the confidentiality
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
of those plans which would be submitted
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
from the high school or the elementary
 
02:27:12.150 --> 02:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
schools because it's all schools
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
what happens in the interim is this
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
going to be confidential by the time it
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
gets to homeland security so they were
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
questioning whether we should even do
 
02:27:20.479 --> 02:27:21.670 align:start position:0%
questioning whether we should even do
that

02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
it was after resolving some of those
 
02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
things with the director and with the
 
02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner at doe we were able to set
 
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
up a process in which that works and
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
right now the legislation which we just
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
addressed earlier this session we go
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
directly down to homeland security
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then they communicate with doe and
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
the oversight of the program this does
 
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility if you haven't done it mr
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
luno in your school then doe is going to
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
get on you get it into homeland security
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
we found that when we initially were
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
handing out that 30 million dollars a
 
02:27:53.830 --> 02:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
number schools had not complied
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
because of the security issues that you
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah representative moffatt
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you miss sharon once again uh you
 
02:28:05.349 --> 02:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
were out of the room uh attorney finn
 
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
did a great job i thought uh tying in
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and the president
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill that's my first point second
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
one is uh i i'm seeing us getting down
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
into the weeds again and this is what
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
slowed down the gifted bill which was
 
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
introduced a long time ago you know
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
folks are getting into what about this
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
or about that and that's not the intent
 
02:28:25.110 --> 02:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
of that bill it was slowed down longer
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
than it needed to be i think
 
02:28:28.469 --> 02:28:28.479 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's not the intent of this
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
spell i'm hearing you know uh you know
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
what about homeland security about all
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
these that's that's what should come out
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
of this if or when this moves forward
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
we don't i'm not looking to get into
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
those details now and finally
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
a procedural question mr chair i'm
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
looking at representative tanner's
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that she passed out which i i
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
think makes a lot of sense and
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
i like it and
 
02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
i do want to say because this i'm sure
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
will come up
 
02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:56.790 align:start position:0%
will come up
um

02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
the wording of the present uh proposed
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
measure simply asked superintendents of
 
02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
districts to to respond with the report
 
02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
districts to to respond with the report
um

02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
and i was kind of waiting for the
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
question what about broadening that and
 
02:29:11.349 --> 02:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
the reason my answer would have been to
 
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
again to keep it uh simple
 
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:14.950 align:start position:0%
again to keep it uh simple
uh

02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
because there are some ephemeral
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions about homeschoolers or some of
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
the new situations but i i really
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
like him and could and would support
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's amendment if we
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
get to that but procedurally to get to
 
02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
get to that but procedurally to get to
that

02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
that
we

02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
we would need to
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.389 --> 02:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh that's my question
 
02:29:42.389 --> 02:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
procedurally i i i could support her
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
amendment i i you know
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
i i've got a lot of questions on on
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
process we're talking about here if
 
02:29:51.190 --> 02:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to find out
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
and try to alert school districts that
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
we should have policies in place and i'm
 
02:29:58.469 --> 02:29:58.479 align:start position:0%
sure they all do we've heard from the
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school boards association
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are boilerplate policies available
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
if we're trying to make get a collection
 
02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
together here
 
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes i feel the legislature starts
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
stepping out of our territory into the
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
territory of the executive branch
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
and the departments an administrative
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
bulletin could easily go out to all the
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
schools addressing the issue of of this
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
issue of policy
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
make sure you have policy in place
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
i see this very narrow it's it's only in
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
classroom it's not the whole school i
 
02:30:34.870 --> 02:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
see this i i just briefly read the
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
amendment here for the first time when i
 
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
see education service providers while
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're going well beyond the schoolhouse
 
02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:41.910 align:start position:0%
we're going well beyond the schoolhouse
now

02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:43.510 align:start position:0%
now
and

02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get in my head what is the
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of the whole thing here um
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
so represent like us you have a question
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
i have some more comments discussion
 
02:31:00.479 --> 02:31:01.750 align:start position:0%
i have some more comments discussion
um

02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
the re i believe the reason it is just
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
classroom recordings is so that we don't
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
get into all of those issues of security
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
and homeland security and if we let the
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
public know what our policies are
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
regarding observing hallways and
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
everything we don't want to make those
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
public so this doesn't cover that this
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
is specifically about in classroom
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
recordings because some schools have
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
talked about putting out recordings in
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
all classrooms and some schools have
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
said they aren't going to do that and
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
and as far as money and that kind of
 
02:31:36.479 --> 02:31:37.910 align:start position:0%
and as far as money and that kind of
stuff

02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
superintendents and the
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know whoever would assistance and
 
02:31:46.550 --> 02:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
whatever who would be filling this out
 
02:31:48.630 --> 02:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
um they're salaried
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
this is par this would be part of their
 
02:31:52.070 --> 02:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
job and
 
02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're only putting in if they have
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
policies so if they have a policy it's
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably in a file it's probably pretty
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
easy to take that file and send it off
 
02:32:05.429 --> 02:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
so it's only if they don't have policies
 
02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
then you get into all the time and the
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
money and all that other stuff but we're
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
not asking them to create policies
 
02:32:14.550 --> 02:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're just saying if the policy is there
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
send it off and so if the policy is
 
02:32:19.349 --> 02:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
there it really should be just a few
 
02:32:22.309 --> 02:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
minutes to click and paste and send off
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
right because the policies are there and
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
so that shouldn't be that hard you're
 
02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
so that shouldn't be that hard you're
not

02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
because they're there right and schools
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
publish those and have those available
 
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's part of the point
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's just if they're not there
 
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
all of that time that money all those
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
issues we're talking about that's up to
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
the school to decide whether they want
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
to do that they could say we don't have
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
a policy and we don't want to have a
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
policy end of story they could say we
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
don't have a policy we didn't even think
 
02:32:54.790 --> 02:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
about it maybe we should have a policy
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
then they can spend all the time money
 
02:32:59.190 --> 02:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
effort etc that they want to develop a
 
02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
effort etc that they want to develop a
policy

02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:33:00.399 --> 02:33:01.510 align:start position:0%
policy
but

02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's the local aspect we're just we're
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
just trying to get them to think about
 
02:33:09.190 --> 02:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
that you know do they have a policy and
 
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
just sending a bulletin
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
which was a suggestion a lot of times
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
bulletins oh yeah but if you actually
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
have to take an action
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
and say we don't have a policy we do
 
02:33:21.190 --> 02:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
have a policy
 
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
that action in and of itself stirs
 
02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
further action and so that's the you
 
02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually have to interact with that
 
02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
question as opposed to just reading and
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
setting aside so at any rate those are
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you this is my final comment um
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
i've never i was i'm extremely surprised
 
02:33:46.630 --> 02:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
mike the six lines have taken almost an
 
02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:48.230 align:start position:0%
mike the six lines have taken almost an
hour

02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
hour
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
as you would be
 
02:33:51.270 --> 02:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
and when i first started this i thought
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know this has no value this is a
 
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
local educational option
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
the nsp if they have an option they give
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
you legislation template you bring it to
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
your lawyer and the thing um so i still
 
02:34:04.150 --> 02:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a local education option i
 
02:34:06.150 --> 02:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
think it doesn't have any value as it is
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
i do think however she struck a very
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
important chord in those three areas i
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
see them as three distinct areas because
 
02:34:14.070 --> 02:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
they have the conjunctions and um so
 
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
those three distinct areas that you
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it should be in statute
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
to that i would agree
 
02:34:22.230 --> 02:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
that if if we think it's that important
 
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
that these three policies should which
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
this does not require but these three
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
policies should be if you want the local
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
school boards to have them
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
then they should be and they have the
 
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
process between the superintendents
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
association or the school board and then
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
miss wilson said the school board
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
typically says here's what you suggest
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
take it to your lawyer
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
i do agree that you that this has value
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
you brought up something not as is
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
framed but i think your intent now after
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
listening after an hour has been
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
illuminated and i would support not this
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
bill as presented but the concept and
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
the future of the statute outlining
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
those three for school boards thank you
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:03.439 --> 02:35:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know i haven't had a chance
 
02:35:09.439 --> 02:35:10.469 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know i haven't had a chance
really

02:35:10.469 --> 02:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
you must have discussed this amendment
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
to some degree i didn't have a chance
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
really or you didn't
 
02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:20.469 align:start position:0%
really or you didn't
ok

02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
that's after lunch
 
02:35:25.030 --> 02:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair the amendment hasn't been
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
proposed yet
 
02:35:29.190 --> 02:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's been no militia made
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
so right now our motion is ought to pass
 
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
on on this particular bill um my
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i'll just reiterate where i'm coming
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
from that there are certain things which
 
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see us further study and
 
02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
look at in terms of
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
videoing within schools but it my
 
02:35:50.469 --> 02:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
concerns are not really what's going on
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the classroom my my my concerns are
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the playground what's
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
going on in the hallways and entry areas
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
and all that
 
02:36:00.309 --> 02:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
and and tying that in with the emergency
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
management response planning
 
02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:05.349 align:start position:0%
management response planning
if

02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
if that's an important aspect of
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
streaming and communicating
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
outside of our building to authorities
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
then i'm all in all in for some kind of
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
a study to look at how we can ensure
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
that that we're going to make our
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
buildings a safer place for kids to be
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
and staff
 
02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
and staff
to

02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
stream just for the sake of of uh having
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
some kind of a recording
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
like we do it's our select board
 
02:36:37.590 --> 02:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
meetings which are all those we do
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
stream and we destroy the records after
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.550 --> 02:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose this this is just
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
as perfect said to collect the policies
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
as a billing principle i used to really
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
get upset over this type of action and
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you 100 moffitt that i knew
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
where this stuff went
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
when it went up to our central office
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
and went in somebody's desk stacked up
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
the pile papers got larger and larger
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
and there was never a result back to us
 
02:37:08.230 --> 02:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
as far as what was the purpose of it at
 
02:37:09.830 --> 02:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
d.o.e i know
 
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
i've seen it over there they have an
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
attic full of stuff up there and
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
they'll be just it'd just be like
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
a bottomless pit um i
 
02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
unlike what we got for the best
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
practices in in gifted and talented i
 
02:37:25.030 --> 02:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
think there's some good things which are
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
going to come out of that process where
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
we we're going to be able to pursue
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the need perhaps
 
02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps not for gifted education be you
 
02:37:34.479 --> 02:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
perhaps not for gifted education be you
know

02:37:35.270 --> 02:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
go beyond just competencies maybe go
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
through some actual curriculum for those
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
which are gifted i don't know
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
but there's there's a lot of good stuff
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from that so um
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know i'm willing to look at an
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
interim study if that's where we think
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
we need to go and and do this thing more
 
02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
justice in terms of a wider scope
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
but if we're not going to go on a wider
 
02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
scope i have a hard time getting on
 
02:38:00.309 --> 02:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
board with it
 
02:38:00.319 --> 02:38:02.389 align:start position:0%
board with it
perhaps

02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
02:38:04.870 --> 02:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
famous chair uh again i i've said this
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
several times um what is happening here
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
is uh what slowed down gifted before and
 
02:38:12.479 --> 02:38:13.349 align:start position:0%
is uh what slowed down gifted before and
what

02:38:13.349 --> 02:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing from you mr chair is
 
02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:16.630 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing from you mr chair is
that

02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:18.870 --> 02:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know all these uh
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
procedural issues and getting down in
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
the weeds
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh and that is
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's good and that's what would come
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
out of this bill if it moved forward uh
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
but what what's happening
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat here is uh
 
02:38:34.950 --> 02:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
not jermaine to the intended bill the
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
the intended bit the proposed measure is
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
simply to
 
02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh do the report you were out of the
 
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
room when attorney fenton uh addressed
 
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
a bunch of questions related to this i
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
wish you could have been here to hear
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
what she had to say but
 
02:38:47.760 --> 02:38:48.630 align:start position:0%
what she had to say but
um

02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
and again i'll finish i know because i'm
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor so i
 
02:38:55.270 --> 02:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
have to speak to some of these things
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier looking at the
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment um i i like it a lot
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
it exp you know it has more people
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
reporting and i explain why we try to
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
keep it simple i would support the
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
amendment but uh we would need i guess
 
02:39:10.469 --> 02:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
there's a motion on the floor
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
and to get to the amendment uh we have
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
to go through the motion
 
02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
to go through the motion
so

02:39:15.910 --> 02:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:16.710 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:21.110 --> 02:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay is there any further discussion on
 
02:39:23.429 --> 02:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:39:25.750 --> 02:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's i'll call the call the uh
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:36.319 --> 02:39:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
can i clarify just as a as a board
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
member not as a clerk um we're voting on
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and then if octopass does
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
not pass then an amendment would come
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
forward i well
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
a new motion excuse me possibly with an
 
02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
a new motion excuse me possibly with an
amendment

02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i haven't heard anybody put forth an
 
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
emotion a motion here at the table today
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:02.479 align:start position:0%
vote down the ought to pass
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
then then we'll take another motion
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
and the motion could be
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
several motions
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:15.510 --> 02:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
you could yes you could
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
so would we withdraw this motion i do
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
not wish as the sponsor i do not wish to
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
make the motion the sponsor does not
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
so basically the motion that we have on
 
02:40:32.830 --> 02:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
the tables ought to pass on this bill
 
02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay so this is bill 1295 requiring
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
reports on excuse me requiring reports
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
concerning policies on classroom
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
recordings and in classroom observers
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli yes
 
02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:54.880 align:start position:0%

bill so there needs to be another motion
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
that comes forward right do you want me
 
02:42:18.550 --> 02:42:18.560 align:start position:0%

02:44:15.750 --> 02:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's that's a good one we
 
02:44:18.150 --> 02:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
can do we can do from yesterday remember
 
02:44:19.429 --> 02:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
we had the
 
02:44:19.439 --> 02:44:20.950 align:start position:0%
we had the
1373

02:44:20.950 --> 02:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
1373
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
that was a bill that had the three
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
categories in the fourth category was
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
that you know it dealt with the the
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
amesbury situation
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
we can park this bill real quickly i
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
think because we do have some
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
information back from the department
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
which uh representative cordelli like to
 
02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
present to us so
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to open up the hearing now
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
on that bill that was what was the
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
number again on that 13 13 13 what
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
i might it's relative to the best
 
02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
interest of the student for a change of
 
02:44:56.960 --> 02:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
interest of the student for a change of
school

02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
or assignment
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
so 1373 um
 
02:45:05.190 --> 02:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh we asked that further information
 
02:45:07.750 --> 02:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
being uh gathered uh represent cordelia
 
02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
has gathered that so before we you know
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
i have a motion put on on the floor here
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
why don't you impart to us what you
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
found out
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes this was the situation
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
where a parent in southampton
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
are caught in the situation where their
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
school has a tuition agreement with
 
02:45:30.630 --> 02:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
amesbury massachusetts and their high
 
02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:31.349 align:start position:0%
amesbury massachusetts and their high
school

02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:45:34.070 --> 02:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
students are sent to amesbury
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
some of them are unhappy
 
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
both with the fact that they're
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
being forced to send their kids out of
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
state and they don't think the education
 
02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:43.510 align:start position:0%
state and they don't think the education
is

02:45:43.510 --> 02:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
really the quality that they want
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
so they asked about
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
being able to go before the board and
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
put forward the idea of tuitioning
 
02:45:57.910 --> 02:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
instead to
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
the local
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
i was able to find some contact
 
02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
i was able to find some contact
information

02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:07.670 align:start position:0%
information
and

02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually talked on the phone last
 
02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:10.870 align:start position:0%
actually talked on the phone last
evening

02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
evening
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
with the parent in southampton
 
02:46:13.439 --> 02:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
with the parent in southampton
and

02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
there have been developments
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
in that the
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
board has agreed
 
02:46:22.319 --> 02:46:23.349 align:start position:0%
board has agreed
to

02:46:23.349 --> 02:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:24.870 --> 02:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
provide an option
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
to tuition students to the
 
02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:30.550 align:start position:0%
to tuition students to the
local

02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire high school
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
the issue that has
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
still caused a situation there
 
02:46:41.830 --> 02:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
is that the parents will have to
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
pay the difference in tuition to go to
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school and as i recall
 
02:46:49.269 --> 02:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
it's about eight thousand dollars
 
02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
the parents would have to pay
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
to go to a new hampshire school
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
we discussed my legislation
 
02:47:03.359 --> 02:47:04.230 align:start position:0%
we discussed my legislation
and

02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reasonable way for us to
 
02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reasonable way for us to
address

02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:47:11.349 --> 02:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
the cost in this legislation and where
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
it is in statute
 
02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:15.990 align:start position:0%
i know that
the

02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
the
parents

02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
state senators
 
02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
senator sherman was interested in
 
02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.550 align:start position:0%
senator sherman was interested in
pursuing

02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
pursuing
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
implications and
 
02:47:29.910 --> 02:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
how that might be addressed and
 
02:47:31.349 --> 02:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know if it should be addressed in
 
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:47:35.269 --> 02:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
what the parent has to pay
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to uh put forward a motion
 
02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
of interim study
 
02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:44.309 align:start position:0%
of interim study
um

02:47:44.309 --> 02:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:46.630 --> 02:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
just to keep alive the idea of you know
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
looking at the tuition costs when a
 
02:47:49.359 --> 02:47:50.550 align:start position:0%
looking at the tuition costs when a
parent

02:47:50.550 --> 02:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
parent
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
is choosing and has been afforded the
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
ability to go to a new hampshire school
 
02:47:57.510 --> 02:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
having to pay thousands of dollars like
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
that i think is something that we should
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
look at
 
02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:03.990 align:start position:0%
look at
yes

02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
so you're are you putting forth a motion
 
02:48:07.269 --> 02:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
right now yes
 
02:48:11.750 --> 02:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
is octopass on the table
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we already have one on the table
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
so we're in discussion mode right now so
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's ought to pass
 
02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:21.750 align:start position:0%
it's ought to pass
so

02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
i could withdraw the motion yeah you
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
could withdraw the motion who was the
 
02:48:28.309 --> 02:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
second in that hey for me me okay would
 
02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
you withdraw the motion also so then we
 
02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
have no motion on the table so yes
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia you can put a
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
motion forward
 
02:48:38.389 --> 02:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
um i will do so a motion of uh interim
 
02:48:38.399 --> 02:48:39.349 align:start position:0%
um i will do so a motion of uh interim
study

02:48:39.349 --> 02:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
second okay so we have that uh represent
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
cordell you want to further discuss that
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
bill or
 
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think further discussion is
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
could i ask a question uh thank you mr
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
chair may i ask a question about the
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
discussion you had with the constituent
 
02:48:57.670 --> 02:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday rep cordelie
 
02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh so i'm i'm confused i wanted to
 
02:49:02.710 --> 02:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
confirm that the
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh southampton resident had the option
 
02:49:07.269 --> 02:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
between winneconnet
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:14.070 --> 02:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
from my conversation previously that was
 
02:49:16.630 --> 02:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
not an option it was not okay and at
 
02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:17.990 align:start position:0%
not an option it was not okay and at
follow-up

02:49:17.990 --> 02:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
the um amesbury school district would
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
not agree
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
to transfer the student
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
if i might the issue was that there was
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
a tuition agreement a five-year tuition
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
agreement in place with amesbury
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh and so it was a matter of um would
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
the school board uh provide uh a local
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire option uh for tuitioning
 
02:49:48.399 --> 02:49:50.710 align:start position:0%
new hampshire option uh for tuitioning
students

02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:49:52.309 --> 02:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
i i'd just like to interject one thing
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
then we'll go around this issue of
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
tuitioning to
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
let's say you're a k-8 and you're going
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
to tuition out to high school
 
02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
some districts have multiple tuition
 
02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:05.429 align:start position:0%
some districts have multiple tuition
agreements

02:50:05.429 --> 02:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh some of those schools and i don't
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
know if it's practice now but it has
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
been a practice in the past
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
where it's been an attorney's
 
02:50:14.319 --> 02:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
where it's been an attorney's
delight

02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
delight
 
02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:16.469 align:start position:0%
delight
where

02:50:16.469 --> 02:50:16.479 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:50:18.710 --> 02:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
the difference in the tuition costs
 
02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
you're up to a colonel now
 
02:50:20.479 --> 02:50:23.349 align:start position:0%
you're up to a colonel now
diane

02:50:23.349 --> 02:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:26.309 --> 02:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
the the difference in tuition
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
had to be paid by the family
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
and when the family came from a
 
02:50:33.750 --> 02:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
situation that did not have the
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to pay that difference they
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford the
 
02:50:40.150 --> 02:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
that that school they had to go over
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
here to another tuition
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
i've heard from some attorneys in fact i
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
heard from our district attorney
 
02:50:51.110 --> 02:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that was discriminatory
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't if you had a tuition
 
02:50:56.550 --> 02:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
agreement as a district
 
02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
with all these different four or five
 
02:50:58.640 --> 02:50:59.990 align:start position:0%
with all these different four or five
schools

02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
then it should be available to all
 
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
students regardless of their means
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and so um that that's the issue we
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
know it's a practice that you know and
 
02:51:11.830 --> 02:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure barrett may have some you know
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
confirmation if it's still going on or
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
not but i believe it is going on in the
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
state in multiple locations so we're
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
touching upon something that's been
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
blistering for years
 
02:51:27.510 --> 02:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
when we start talking about this tuition
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
stuff with an interim study of some kind
 
02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:31.590 align:start position:0%
stuff with an interim study of some kind
it's

02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you we didn't have our high
 
02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
school we would twist wing to wish we
 
02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
school we would twist wing to wish we
tuitioning

02:51:41.030 --> 02:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.469 --> 02:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:47.110 --> 02:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
two hudson and manchester but in the
 
02:51:49.670 --> 02:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
agreement with both was
 
02:51:51.030 --> 02:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
a percentage
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
no more than 25
 
02:51:56.230 --> 02:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
to manchester i got water right now and
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
no less than 75
 
02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:52:04.389 --> 02:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
to hudson but there was always a gap
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
that no you know that agreed on both
 
02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
sides so it was never an issue about
 
02:52:11.910 --> 02:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
that but yeah there is a an issue and
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised that much i think it was a
 
02:52:17.190 --> 02:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school to an after school
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be eight thousand dollars
 
02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
different than tuition
 
02:52:23.670 --> 02:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
i mean that's surprising with me with
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
ainsbury 8 000 different than sending a
 
02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
kid to a new hampshire school
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
i please don't hold me to that number
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
but that was my recollection of
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
our telephone conversation this was just
 
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion on
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is not a snarky question at all
 
02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
this is not a snarky question at all
okay

02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
but isn't it it's my understanding that
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
that family could they have applied for
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
an efa
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
and gotten that tuition money to help
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
them pay going over to a another public
 
02:52:56.389 --> 02:52:56.399 align:start position:0%
school i i
 
02:52:59.190 --> 02:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
asked him about that and
 
02:53:01.110 --> 02:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
he did not think he would qualify under
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
the income limits
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
all right we're gonna get a
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know be called american airlines
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
here never starting on time or never
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
arriving on time
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
but we're pretty close so what we need
 
04:06:20.469 --> 04:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
to do now is continue um
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
the executing exact sessions here and we
 
04:06:26.070 --> 04:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
did uh hop over one of the bills here
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
earlier today i'd like to go back
 
04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
and cover that bill that is 11 37
 
04:06:34.870 --> 04:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
relative to the duty of school boards to
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
provide education
 
04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
so if we go
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
switch you know and cover 11 30 sec look
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
at find 1137 in our
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.000 --> 04:06:49.189 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
11 37 i'm i'm gonna look to um
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i'll second it
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh rip some boom do you have any
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.680 --> 04:07:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
just that it's uh very broad and covers
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
a lot so i think we really need to look
 
04:07:16.000 --> 04:07:17.110 align:start position:0%
a lot so i think we really need to look
at

04:07:17.110 --> 04:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
what really school boards should be
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
doing uh for example superintendent and
 
04:07:25.110 --> 04:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
all that so i i think it really
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the second on the motion i
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
will also echo a little bit of what
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
ralph just said uh it's a it's a very
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
broad bill
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and it covers uh everything from
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
structure content
 
04:07:42.790 --> 04:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
accountability advocacy delivery of
 
04:07:42.800 --> 04:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
accountability advocacy delivery of
instruction

04:07:43.990 --> 04:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
and then gets onto some
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
some of the duties of
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh got a lot in it and it's
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
probably got a lot it's missing as well
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason i also support
 
04:07:58.630 --> 04:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:07:58.640 --> 04:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
interim study
uh

04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:01.110 --> 04:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion representative
 
04:08:03.040 --> 04:08:04.389 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion representative
cordelli

04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:07.199 --> 04:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
the motion is defeated i will
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
the intent is
 
04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to address
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
a number of things that have been going
 
04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
on in school boards
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
04:08:33.110 --> 04:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
problems um
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
i'll start with i was go down a list of
 
04:08:37.910 --> 04:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
a few of the things that i wanted to
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
address i believe that there are many
 
04:08:43.189 --> 04:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
school boards who think that they report
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent as
 
04:08:48.309 --> 04:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to the other way around
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think that there have been problems
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
with parental engagement
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
people not being listened to people
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.229 --> 04:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
i think this needs to be
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
remedied and
 
04:09:03.590 --> 04:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
should be developing policies to promote
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
school board members
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
being silenced being muzzled
 
04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
just as we represent people and
 
04:09:21.670 --> 04:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
have a free reign for discussion i think
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
school board members should as well
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
the public should be encouraged to
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
attend board meetings
 
04:09:32.149 --> 04:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
very often public comment is held at the
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
it could be a late hour uh it
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
agenda items that they might want to
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
address have already been
 
04:09:50.149 --> 04:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
decided with no input from them at the
 
04:09:50.159 --> 04:09:52.630 align:start position:0%
decided with no input from them at the
meeting

04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
it discourages
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
parental engagement um and i think that
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
that needs to be remedy and i tried to
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
also transparency um is another major
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
area i tried to address in here
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
in that um information um
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
should be eva made available on
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instructional materials
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
all should be made made available and be
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
available to parents
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
in my local district
 
04:10:24.479 --> 04:10:26.630 align:start position:0%
in my local district
um

04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
a group of parents were contacted by the
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
town prosecutor and told um if you don't
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
stop with 91a requests for curriculum
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
materials we're going to refer you to
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
it goes on
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
there should be information on each
 
04:10:53.520 --> 04:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
there should be information on each
um

04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
district's website about
 
04:11:01.110 --> 04:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
a number of areas we had a bill um to uh
 
04:11:01.120 --> 04:11:02.149 align:start position:0%
a number of areas we had a bill um to uh
provide

04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh was it um
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
cost per student on
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
ballot measures
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
i think that all district websites
 
04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
should have a link to the department
 
04:11:17.600 --> 04:11:18.469 align:start position:0%
should have a link to the department
web

04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
web
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
site the i platform
 
04:11:22.950 --> 04:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
series there was a demonstration last
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
night it's
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
been greatly enhanced and there's
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
phenomenal information available there
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
that should be available to parents on
 
04:11:32.149 --> 04:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
each district website
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
we have to do more
 
04:11:39.279 --> 04:11:41.110 align:start position:0%
we have to do more
parents

04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
parents
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
definitely have a role in their
 
04:11:46.149 --> 04:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
children's education and those who
 
04:11:46.159 --> 04:11:47.189 align:start position:0%
children's education and those who
believe

04:11:47.189 --> 04:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise i think are
 
04:11:49.199 --> 04:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
otherwise i think are
hurting

04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
hurting
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
public education in this state and in
 
04:11:55.590 --> 04:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
this nation and i was trying to address
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
some of those things
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:11:58.319 --> 04:12:00.309 align:start position:0%
in this
legislation

04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
is there further discussion on the bill
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent litchfield
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
i would just like to echo what
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has said um i
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
could not agree more i just feel that
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
what's out there right now for school
 
04:12:19.349 --> 04:12:19.359 align:start position:0%
board members is extremely vague
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
i've been on the board a couple of
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
boards for many many years and
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's still very difficult for me to
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
truly navigate
 
04:12:28.149 --> 04:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
what my role is i know we hear budget
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
and policy all the time but you know if
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
i had a dollar for every time i heard
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
the superintendent say
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's my decision with regard to any
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
other staff and administrator you know
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
you employ me and nobody else it's a
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
very frustrating and confusing place to
 
04:12:43.920 --> 04:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
very frustrating and confusing place to
be

04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
and i just want to point out the other
 
04:12:48.149 --> 04:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
side too
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's difficult for board members
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
and parents from the standpoint of
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
parents can get very frustrated with
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
different situations and oftentimes they
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
will go directly to the board members
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
they won't necessarily start with the
 
04:13:01.680 --> 04:13:02.630 align:start position:0%
they won't necessarily start with the
teacher

04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
go to the principal and the
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent they just look at it like
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
you're bored why aren't you handling
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
this and it's not even part of the
 
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
board's purview so i just think for all
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
involved at some point we really should
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
nail this down thank you
 
04:13:18.229 --> 04:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
just for reference here i'd like to
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
quote a couple areas within statutory
 
04:13:23.279 --> 04:13:24.229 align:start position:0%

in fact if you have your yellow books
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
you look on page one of that book
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
and look at rsa 21 n colon one

hampshire
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
or a lot of groups that are involved in
 
04:14:08.950 --> 04:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
this responsibility and in this system
 
04:14:11.590 --> 04:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
we call education in the state
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
then if we turn to some of the duties
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
that are the responsibility of the
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.269 --> 04:14:27.279 align:start position:0%

04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
a school district shall make curriculum
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
course materials available to parents or
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
legal guardians for review upon request
 
04:14:36.870 --> 04:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's already in law
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about
 
04:14:39.439 --> 04:14:40.149 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about
us

04:14:40.149 --> 04:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
as a legislative branch of government
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
getting involved more so in the
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
governance of local school districts
 
04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
which are controlled by local elected
 
04:14:50.239 --> 04:14:51.830 align:start position:0%
which are controlled by local elected
officials

04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
officials
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
because we may see something that is not
 
04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
what we think is appropriate or not
 
04:14:56.159 --> 04:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
what we think is appropriate or not
working

04:14:57.189 --> 04:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
working
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
or is it the job of the
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
the electorate out there
 
04:15:04.389 --> 04:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
the legislative body of the town to make
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
that choice and that decision that's the
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
questions i put out
 
04:15:11.990 --> 04:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
for us maybe in while we're discussing
 
04:15:12.000 --> 04:15:14.070 align:start position:0%
for us maybe in while we're discussing
this

04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:15:18.070 --> 04:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
where's it starting where's it stop
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
so that yes represent boom
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up on that and what
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative litfield
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
said i remember when i was on the school
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
board our policy to the superintendent
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
is yes you can hire but we have to agree
 
04:15:34.469 --> 04:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
with it and we took votes on
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
who the hire
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the school school board
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
tells the superintendent what their job
 
04:15:39.600 --> 04:15:40.550 align:start position:0%
tells the superintendent what their job
is

04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
not the superintendent telling the
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
school i think that's really needs to do
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
need to really look at and make sure
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's being done
 
04:15:49.349 --> 04:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
and yeah another thing too following up
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
on what rick said but
 
04:15:53.359 --> 04:15:54.389 align:start position:0%
on what rick said but
it's

04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of stuff in law already and that's
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
what i think we need to really look at
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
what's already in law and what really
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
04:16:06.550 --> 04:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:09.030 --> 04:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the point of this
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's not to change the law
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
as much it as it is to itemize because a
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
lot of school board members don't know
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to be doing and
 
04:16:22.149 --> 04:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
don't realize that yes they're the ones
 
04:16:23.910 --> 04:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
in charge of the superintendent i have
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
from school board members in communities
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
and so this lays it out and says and so
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
and a bunch of it
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
is in law that's the whole point it's
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
laying it out in an organized form that
 
04:16:42.870 --> 04:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.269 --> 04:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
and i believe there was a question to
 
04:16:47.110 --> 04:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
have barrett christina up
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
well let's get a couple more things out
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
here first i see a couple hands up first
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative cornell
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
i i think that in manchester when you're
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
elected to the school board they go to a
 
04:16:59.269 --> 04:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
school board orientation
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
and and it's
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
they they learn what
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
the role is of all the school board
 
04:17:08.229 --> 04:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
members and actually i think the
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittees too and they make the
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
decisions there of what to do and i also
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
think we have a school charter in
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
manchester so any changes to anything
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
that happens on our school board would
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
have to first everybody would have to
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
vote that they wanted to have a charter
 
04:17:23.920 --> 04:17:24.950 align:start position:0%
vote that they wanted to have a charter
amendment

04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
a charter committee and then they'd have
 
04:17:29.910 --> 04:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
to put forth the changes and then
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
everybody votes on the charter so
 
04:17:32.800 --> 04:17:33.830 align:start position:0%
everybody votes on the charter so
i

04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know that this legislation would
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
change anything uh or even overrule that
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure but i know they all go
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
to an uh an orientation where they learn
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
all of the um the rules
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
or they try to learn they try to learn
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're told
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%

04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
went through a legislative orientation
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%

thank you are there technical questions
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
that might come from the uh committee
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the school boards association yes
 
04:18:46.950 --> 04:18:46.960 align:start position:0%

thank you barry i know manchester does
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
go to an orientation do is that typical
 
04:18:54.790 --> 04:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
of all school boards that they are our
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
new school board members learned things
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
like that thank you very much for the
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
question uh representative yes
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
manchester has mandatory training within
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
local rules
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
as i believe it was representative
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
woodcock asked the question
 
04:19:10.469 --> 04:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
when the bill was being heard about our
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
trainings and our orientations
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
two statewide orientation trainings
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
every year
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing them via zoom now
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
usually the beginning of may
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
between the two sessions we get about
 
04:19:26.790 --> 04:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
maybe 100 120 new school board members
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
that tune into that
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to the two webinars
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
we do orientation we call them our sort
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
of orientation slash roles and
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities training
 
04:19:39.269 --> 04:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
um where we you know identify the duties
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities of school boards
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
compare and contrast those to the duties
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities of superintendents
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully if we're doing our
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
job right we're able to help school
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
board members find that sort of middle
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
ground which is sort of best practices
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you will in addition to the two
 
04:19:54.149 --> 04:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
webinars um that we do for the
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
orientations we often go out and do
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
individual trainings on
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
roles and responsibilities
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
to individual
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
to look to local communities where we'll
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
do it in person
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
that request is often made by either the
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
board chair or the superintendent some
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
boards have us out every year
 
04:20:13.439 --> 04:20:14.229 align:start position:0%
boards have us out every year
um

04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
following march elections even if they
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
have one new school board member or four
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
new school board members part and parcel
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
they ask us to come out every year and
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
other school boards do it on sort of a
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
rotating basis and we do anywhere
 
04:20:24.840 --> 04:20:26.550 align:start position:0%
rotating basis and we do anywhere
between

04:20:26.550 --> 04:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
in any given year i think i said 50 to
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
80 during my initial testimony some
 
04:20:33.110 --> 04:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
years it's 40 some years it's 60 that we
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
do of those
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much either for the
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
question representative mullen
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
christina for taking my question does
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the school boards association provide
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
professional development to school board
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
members and what i'm thinking about
 
04:20:52.870 --> 04:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
specifically is
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
as a classroom teacher i had to
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
literally take
 
04:20:58.080 --> 04:20:59.349 align:start position:0%
literally take
coursework

04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
coursework
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
in something known as how to deal with
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
difficult people
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
does is there's literally is there
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
something like that for school board
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
members uh
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
and or is there a manual trying not to
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
make a joke ladies and gentlemen i'll go
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
ahead respectfully respectfully you know
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
my humor by now thank you for the
 
04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
question representative there is no
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory training in new hampshire law
 
04:21:27.429 --> 04:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
for school board members some states do
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
have mandatory training for school board
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
members you have to take x number of
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
hours within your first year or two
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
years of being on the board that has
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
come up
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
before in this body not in the last i
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
want to say
 
04:21:41.910 --> 04:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 years or so
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.910 --> 04:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's funny that you ask that about how
 
04:21:49.830 --> 04:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
to getting along with difficult people
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
because there are times nhsb is
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
called out to do a training
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
and there may be conflict between
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
a board member and the superintendent or
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
the board and the superintendent or
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's between two board members
 
04:22:04.720 --> 04:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's between two board members
um

04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
and you know some
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
there there are times you know my staff
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
attorney and i will leave a training and
 
04:22:12.710 --> 04:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
it goes well and there are times that we
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
leave and say
 
04:22:15.429 --> 04:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
you know they need therapy they don't
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
need an attorney so
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:22.309 --> 04:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know if that answers your
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
question but a follow-up thing yes um
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
in your experience are there school
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
boards that work well
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
most school boards i think
 
04:22:35.670 --> 04:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
work well i mean as as i mentioned in
 
04:22:37.110 --> 04:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
some of my other testimony i believe it
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
was on this bill
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know everybody's that have
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
challenges um either getting along or
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
moving through their work absolutely but
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know there are 176 school boards in
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
you know on average if they meet twice a
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
month how many meetings is that
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know the ones you hear about are are
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
the outliers you know the ones that are
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
on channel 9 or
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
at front page of the union leader
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
those are outliers you never hear about
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
the dozens and dozens and dozens of
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
school board meetings that are running
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
efficiently where the board's getting
 
04:23:09.429 --> 04:23:09.439 align:start position:0%
their work done that doesn't make the
 
04:23:09.439 --> 04:23:10.389 align:start position:0%
their work done that doesn't make the
news

04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
news
 
04:23:10.399 --> 04:23:11.590 align:start position:0%
news
so

04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further

04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
barrett for being here today and for
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
comments and questions um first of all i
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
want to say i have attended some of the
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
workshops uh with this that the school
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
board association used to offer where
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
you would go to the hotel and you go
 
04:23:37.110 --> 04:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
into the different workshops and i found
 
04:23:39.030 --> 04:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that to be extremely helpful
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
um i i don't know if that's happening
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
now because of covid it's probably not
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
um but i was just wondering
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh many times at these hearings we hear
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
from the school board association and
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
and um they're they're sort of on the
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
side of the school
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
if parents have issues with this with
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
in their local community how do you
 
04:24:06.149 --> 04:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
suggest they bridge the gaps thank you
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um and to your first
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
part that i believe you're talking about
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
the kid or law conference
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
that we have at the graponi um yep um
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we did have to do that virtually um
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh in 2021 i guess it was but no we're
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
back doing those those in person so um
 
04:24:23.040 --> 04:24:23.830 align:start position:0%
back doing those those in person so um
so

04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
to the second question um how can
 
04:24:28.389 --> 04:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
parents or the community bridge the gap
 
04:24:30.389 --> 04:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
if they're having challenges with their
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
own local school board
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i mean i i think
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
raising your concerns initially i think
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
with usually the board chair is going to
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
be your first point of contact
 
04:24:44.790 --> 04:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
a letter or an email
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
or a phone call my experience is that
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
many if not most school boards have
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
their contact information online some
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
are just an email address and you gotta
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
hope that email gets responded to
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes the phone number is on there
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
depending on depending on the district
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'd say call your board chair initially
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
and say i have a concern about this if
 
04:25:05.760 --> 04:25:06.550 align:start position:0%
and say i have a concern about this if
it's

04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know the potholes in the in the in
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
the driveway if it's about a you know
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps a particular program or course
 
04:25:15.269 --> 04:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
of study or curriculum
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
um or you know you don't have a public
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
comment period or you're doing it at the
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
end we would ask that you move it to the
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
beginning or perhaps start with a
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
conversation with your board chair um
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know raise your concerns
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
at a public comment portion um during
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
the meeting um presuming your board
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
offers that um you know
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
if need be follow up with a subsequent
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
um email or letter to the full board
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
copying the superintendent um
 
04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:25:44.720 --> 04:25:45.429 align:start position:0%
you know
we

04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
you have to you know parents have to
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
engage with school boards and reciprocal
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
in in reciprocation of that school
 
04:25:53.349 --> 04:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
boards have an obligation to be
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
responsive to the parents and their
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
constituents um you know talking helps
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know yelling and screaming like what
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
we saw at some of the meetings last
 
04:26:04.550 --> 04:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
summer is not helpful um you know but
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
dialogue can't hurt so i think that
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be the first step and you know if
 
04:26:11.110 --> 04:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
your board is responsive great if
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
they're not responsive i would hope that
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
the board would at least give reasons
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
why what you're asking for is contrary
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
to either this particular law
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
or it's contrary to
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it might be the ba
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
says it's not possible in this year's
 
04:26:24.080 --> 04:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
says it's not possible in this year's
budget

04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:26:25.040 --> 04:26:25.910 align:start position:0%
budget
um

04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
04:26:29.349 --> 04:26:29.359 align:start position:0%
engage with people
 
04:26:31.429 --> 04:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
try and be respectful obviously and
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
again that goes both ways as well too i
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
mean i think that's the the
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
the simplest way is is to do it you know
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
yelling and screaming at a school board
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and getting belligerent at a
 
04:26:42.070 --> 04:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
school board meeting for your three
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
minutes often doesn't help anything but
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you can have a phone call and have a
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
cup of coffee as i mentioned before
 
04:26:49.110 --> 04:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
against some of these hearings these are
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
your neighbors you know you know
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative i i presume when you got
 
04:26:55.110 --> 04:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
on your school board it was because you
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
knew the parents and you knew the
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
teachers and you knew the kids and they
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
knew you in the community so they
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
trusted you and they wanted you to be
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
their voice that's why they elected you
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
and you know so you talked to parents
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
when you were on the school board and
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
you engaged with parents when you were
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
on the school board um
 
04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not crazy about using
 
04:27:12.870 --> 04:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
social media to engage with constituents
 
04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
just because that can turn south real
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
real quick um so but you know i
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
hope that helps
 
04:27:22.229 --> 04:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:24.790 --> 04:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you represent litchfield
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
can you help me just so i can direct
 
04:27:32.309 --> 04:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
other board members or even even myself
 
04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
where exactly are things if they are
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
spelled out
 
04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
and defined exactly what the roles are
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
of i feel like so i feel like it's very
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
vague and if i could just if you humor
 
04:27:47.110 --> 04:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
me for a minute um with an example
 
04:27:49.510 --> 04:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
so i've annually pretty much sat through
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
your training i very much appreciate it
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to say that when i've
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
gone to your offices and you've taught
 
04:27:57.189 --> 04:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
let's say on default budgets etc changes
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
in the laws
 
04:28:00.070 --> 04:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful i've gone back and
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
taught constituents budget committee
 
04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
members everything so i want to first
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
say thank you for that
 
04:28:05.760 --> 04:28:06.710 align:start position:0%
say thank you for that
but

04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to initially being elected
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
um you know you're you're brought in
 
04:28:13.750 --> 04:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of who the superintendent is
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
event there were a few where you they
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
have that talk you that you handle
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
things behind close right
 
04:28:22.710 --> 04:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
it i'm just keeping it real i know what
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
people don't like to hear but no
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
surprises you handle things behind
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
closed doors um only the board chair
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
responds to things which is difficult
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
especially in a co-op right because it
 
04:28:34.870 --> 04:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
makes it look like you're unresponsive
 
04:28:36.469 --> 04:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
if you don't and these are all things
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about before
 
04:28:40.399 --> 04:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
that you've heard about before
so

04:28:41.110 --> 04:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
for me personally
 
04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
i just want to know
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
where can i look if i had a dollar for
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
every time i have heard you i you just
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
work you know i just you just do my
 
04:28:55.110 --> 04:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
review or i just work for you whatever
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
but you have no say about any
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
administrators or what they're doing or
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going on um if i had a
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
dollar for every time i heard that i
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
could take you guys to a street lunch
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
right now so i just want to understand
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
where where can i get that information
 
04:29:09.110 --> 04:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
so i stop asking you every time you sit
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
in that seat
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
most of the statutes and the rsas and
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
189 are going to be pretty
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
broad and and vague if i don't want to
 
04:29:24.389 --> 04:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
say vague but pretty broad
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
a a list of
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
school boards do this
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
a b c d so on and so forth and you're
 
04:29:35.590 --> 04:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
not going to find a list that says
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
superintendents do this a b c d the more
 
04:29:41.429 --> 04:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
directive i guess the i think the first
 
04:29:43.110 --> 04:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
place to look would be the department of
 
04:29:45.750 --> 04:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
education rules in the 300 series
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
302 is the duties and responsibilities
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
of the superintendent there's 302.01 and
 
04:29:51.439 --> 04:29:53.510 align:start position:0%
of the superintendent there's 302.01 and
302.02

04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
302.02
 
04:29:53.520 --> 04:29:54.429 align:start position:0%
302.02
ed

04:29:54.429 --> 04:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
ed
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
303.01 is roles and responsibility or
 
04:29:59.269 --> 04:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
duties and responsibilities of school
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
boards okay
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
also look at the department of education
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
rule 306 the minimum standards
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning aspect of that and you
 
04:30:10.870 --> 04:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
know this represents because you've been
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
to our trainings you're always the
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
a-plus student at each of those
 
04:30:15.199 --> 04:30:16.229 align:start position:0%
a-plus student at each of those
um

04:30:16.229 --> 04:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know we talk about all the policies
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
that are required by law and you know we
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
talk about policy work being you know
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
the the first aspect of good school
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
board governance that's because the
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
minimum standards ed 306.04
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
talk about the school board shall adopt
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
the following policies and there's a
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
list of
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
25 policies that are required by law and
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
if you were to go to 306 and do a word
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
search of board you're gonna get a 500
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
hits so just be mindful of that
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
it will say the board shall develop a
 
04:30:51.349 --> 04:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
a policy if you will
 
04:30:53.680 --> 04:30:54.469 align:start position:0%
a policy if you will
so

04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know on
 
04:30:57.189 --> 04:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
so you're not going to find a
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list of boards do this
 
04:31:02.389 --> 04:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
administrators do this
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
we also have to be mindful that we have
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 194
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
dash c colon 4.
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
duties and responsibilities of
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
superintendents we've got the doe rules
 
04:31:15.030 --> 04:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
that i've talked about we also have um a
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
provisioning statute and again that's
 
04:31:20.950 --> 04:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
probably got 20 paragraphs a through
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
qrr that talks about the superintendent
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
payroll cash flow payroll you know
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
payroll um
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
management of federal grants you know
 
04:31:34.149 --> 04:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
duty and supervision of employees and
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
students um
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
a whole whole list of things that are
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
within the duty of the responsible
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the superintendent
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that hsba advocates
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
so strongly that policy work is the
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
basis of good governance is because by
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
policy work you are directing your
 
04:31:50.479 --> 04:31:51.990 align:start position:0%
policy work you are directing your
superintendent

04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
how you want him or her to do the job in
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
what manner you want them to do the job
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
because no law is going to be complete
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
no department of education here's the
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
way i look at it we have statutes right
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
we have the rsas
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards and the department
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
of education rules fill in a lot of gaps
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
for the statutes they help clarify right
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
but then your local policies then help
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of those department of
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
education rules at the local level and
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
to some degree that's where one of the
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
last vestiges of local control is
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
through those school board policies
 
04:32:26.790 --> 04:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
where the department of education may
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
have a rule that says school boards you
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
have to adopt a policy on homework this
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
is just one example it doesn't say what
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
that policy has to include so local
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
boards are then free to determine is
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
their homework policy going to count
 
04:32:41.189 --> 04:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
towards grades how much is going to be
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
given every night are there guidelines
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
10 minutes per classroom or per per
 
04:32:46.870 --> 04:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
grade level is sort of i think a
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
standard that educators use from time to
 
04:32:48.800 --> 04:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
standard that educators use from time to
time

04:32:49.590 --> 04:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:32:49.600 --> 04:32:50.389 align:start position:0%
time
so

04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:32:54.149 --> 04:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
there isn't going to be a comprehensive
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
list representative about again as i
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
said about
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
whose territory this is and whose
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
territory this is um to some degree some
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
of these department of education rules
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
and the 194 c4
 
04:33:09.189 --> 04:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's some level of contradiction from
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
time to time you know within the
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
statutes and within the rules so policy
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
can help clarify that but you know
 
04:33:15.520 --> 04:33:16.869 align:start position:0%
can help clarify that but you know
nothing

04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:33:18.150 --> 04:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know nothing is
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
nothing can help better than i think
 
04:33:19.920 --> 04:33:21.029 align:start position:0%
nothing can help better than i think
positive

04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
positive
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
board superintendent relationships
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
ascertaining how things are going to get
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
done what things are going to get done
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know how the board wants to see them
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
to see them done i mean you know if you
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
look at some of those department of
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
education rules and and the statutes um
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
relative to the superintendent's duties
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
you know it talks about the
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
superintendent is responsible for
 
04:33:44.470 --> 04:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating staff so to some degree
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's not a board's issue
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
if you know if if there's a problem in
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
the second grade classroom and you're
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
getting those calls from your
 
04:33:50.000 --> 04:33:51.429 align:start position:0%
getting those calls from your
constituents

04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
the board has
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
one as an individual board member you
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
have no legal authority to do anything
 
04:33:58.390 --> 04:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
you understand that but two the board
 
04:34:00.070 --> 04:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any legal authority to do
 
04:34:01.990 --> 04:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do any to do that either the
 
04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
recommendation to hire or to non-renew
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
has to come from the superintendent
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
i mean that's not
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
that's not me that's not nhsba saying
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that's what the statute says and it
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
seems to have worked that way for a
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
number of years superintendent nominates
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
right and the board elects you know that
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
language um
 
04:34:24.070 --> 04:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
so you know so so that's if if if the
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
parent is upset with something is it is
 
04:34:30.150 --> 04:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
it pertinent for them to to to to
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
contact the board and let the board know
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the complaints well yeah for i mean
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
so the board has an idea of what's going
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
on but that doesn't mean the board has
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
any legal authority to resolve the issue
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know you've got to talk to the
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
parent to the teacher you've got to talk
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
to the principal you've got to talk to
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and are you going to
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
go into a non-public session with one
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
parent to talk about their particular
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
issue maybe maybe not but if you want to
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
do that to let them have their say you
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
can but if you're doing that to
 
04:34:59.670 --> 04:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
potentially resolve an issue again you
 
04:35:01.510 --> 04:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't have you meaning the board doesn't
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
have any authority to do that it's just
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way the law is set up and you
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately sometimes the answer
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
is no sometimes the answer's got to be
 
04:35:09.359 --> 04:35:10.230 align:start position:0%
is no sometimes the answer's got to be
no

04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:35:10.240 --> 04:35:10.949 align:start position:0%
no
so

04:35:10.949 --> 04:35:10.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
i i was a i was a long way to get to
 
04:35:16.551 --> 04:35:16.561 align:start position:0%
your question representative i hope i
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
answered and i hope i provided some info
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
you gave me an aha moment so i want to
 
04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
say thank you for that we're giving away
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
our power through policy
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
at times
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
not always that would that would be your
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
board's decision yeah thank you you're
 
04:35:30.561 --> 04:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
board's decision yeah thank you you're
welcome

04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
just just a point of clarification which
 
04:35:36.789 --> 04:35:36.799 align:start position:0%
i think supports where you are a select
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
board's in the same domain the town
 
04:35:39.199 --> 04:35:40.551 align:start position:0%
board's in the same domain the town
manager

04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
manager
 
04:35:40.561 --> 04:35:41.670 align:start position:0%
manager
hires

04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
hires
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
and fires it's not the select board
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
and unless you have a town administrator
 
04:35:50.150 --> 04:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
which have different capacities and
 
04:35:52.230 --> 04:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
different roles from each other
 
04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
so it's not too different than what we
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
see on the municipal side as well sure
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh can i i'm sorry representative can i
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
follow up just to represent litchfield's
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
last comment um
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
you said that boards are exceeding their
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
power and authority via policy that that
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
may be one way of looking at it
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of one school school board
 
04:36:15.119 --> 04:36:16.629 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of one school school board
that

04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
felt that the board should be in charge
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
of everything and that the
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
superintendent should be subservient
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
went through sample policies or not not
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
sample policies their policies their
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
their school boards policies everywhere
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
in policy where it says the
 
04:36:34.150 --> 04:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent shall
 
04:36:37.269 --> 04:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
they struck that out and wrote the board
 
04:36:37.279 --> 04:36:37.990 align:start position:0%
they struck that out and wrote the board
so

04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
the board was involved and you know to
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
some point where it became unmanageable
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
all i won't say how many school board
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
members there were because that may give
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
away what board but that board would
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
have been working
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
24 7 quote unquote managing the school
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
district which is not the board's
 
04:36:54.080 --> 04:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
district which is not the board's
responsibility

04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
so and there's there's a there's got to
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
be a balance in there i recognize that
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
and that balance is going to be
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
i've always had this concern even when i
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
was on the school board later about the
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
school board also having
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
your judicial responsibility which means
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
the school board can't know that's right
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
what is going on in a lot of cases
 
04:37:24.070 --> 04:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
because they might have to act as a
 
04:37:24.080 --> 04:37:25.750 align:start position:0%
because they might have to act as a
judge

04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
for a situation which i always found to
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
be a problem because you know what's
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
going on especially in small school
 
04:37:33.429 --> 04:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
districts right yet you can't do
 
04:37:35.830 --> 04:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
anything about it because you've got to
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
i mean my concern was
 
04:37:39.910 --> 04:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
maybe something better than something
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
like the selectmen do is
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
have somebody you appointing former
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
members yeah to act as a judiciary i've
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:37:52.470 --> 04:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative i
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
just just so
 
04:37:56.390 --> 04:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
the non-school board members that are on
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
this committee from time to time a
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
school board has to serve as an
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicative body where you have a
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
student hearing or a staff hearing where
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
you're impacting somebody's rights
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
you're either suspending a kid
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
um from school or or firing a a teacher
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
or terminating a teacher or non-renewing
 
04:38:14.390 --> 04:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
a teacher so the board is serving as
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
judge and jury if you will and there's a
 
04:38:15.920 --> 04:38:16.869 align:start position:0%
judge and jury if you will and there's a
hearing

04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
the teacher the student is there almost
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
the defendant if you will and they've
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
got their attorney
 
04:38:24.150 --> 04:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the the superintendent and the
 
04:38:25.910 --> 04:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
principal are sitting there as the
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
prosecutor with their attorney and then
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
the board is sitting up as us as a judge
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
with their attorney
 
04:38:32.320 --> 04:38:33.670 align:start position:0%
with their attorney
um

04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:35.109 --> 04:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
if you got three attorneys in the room
 
04:38:36.310 --> 04:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
you probably should have done some
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
things to not get to that point in the
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
first place
 
04:38:38.959 --> 04:38:40.150 align:start position:0%
first place
um

04:38:40.150 --> 04:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:41.910 --> 04:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and exactly which is you know
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
another reason that we have to caution
 
04:38:45.910 --> 04:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
our our members about you how to be
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
mindful when you're when you're taking
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
these complaints and these concerns from
 
04:38:51.029 --> 04:38:51.039 align:start position:0%
these parents because
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
they may be biasing you or prejudicing
 
04:38:54.390 --> 04:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
you and if it's something that may get
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
to a hearing
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
you've got to serve as judge and judy
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
you've gotta you know you've gotta be
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
mindful that you don't bias yourself and
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
i've never run into it myself but i know
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
some of my um uh colleagues that
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
represent school districts have run into
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
that time and time where the board
 
04:39:21.510 --> 04:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
members have posted something on
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
facebook where they were clearly buy
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
some prejudice and they had to run
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
around town trying to find i think they
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
found a couple former board members i
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
think they found an attorney in town but
 
04:39:32.551 --> 04:39:32.561 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a pain in the butt you
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
know it was difficult so yeah i mean you
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
know do we create some sort of tribunal
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's not associated with the
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
the district to hear this sort of thing
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know it's
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
but it's it's and it's small the smaller
 
04:39:46.390 --> 04:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
the district the harder it is because
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know the kids and you know the
 
04:39:49.110 --> 04:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
families and you know the teachers and
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's why you ran for school board
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
because you know the kids because you
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
know the parents and you know the
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
teachers right
 
04:39:55.430 --> 04:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
right right representative that's why
 
04:39:57.350 --> 04:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
you run for school board i know i know
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
how this works
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
04:40:05.280 --> 04:40:06.310 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
um

04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:06.320 --> 04:40:09.110 align:start position:0%
um
given

04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the right word
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
acrimony maybe that we've seen
 
04:40:17.200 --> 04:40:20.230 align:start position:0%
acrimony maybe that we've seen
in

04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
some school districts
 
04:40:23.520 --> 04:40:26.070 align:start position:0%
some school districts
and

04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
04:40:32.150 --> 04:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
that having something like this
 
04:40:35.590 --> 04:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
preemptively diffuse that
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative i mean i haven't i didn't
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
i haven't contemplated in that angle i
 
04:40:47.510 --> 04:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
believe when rep when the bill was first
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
being heard i think representative baum
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
asked something similar wouldn't this
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
help us develop the policies and the
 
04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
trainings and um again i think it was
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield asked you know
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
do you know we opposed a bill was there
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
anything in here that we did support and
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think i went through and i highlighted
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
a couple that we didn't necessarily have
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
specific objections to
 
04:41:05.920 --> 04:41:06.788 align:start position:0%
specific objections to
um

04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:06.798 --> 04:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know i i i think my previous
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
testimony you know indicated um
 
04:41:14.948 --> 04:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know school boards are already doing
 
04:41:16.150 --> 04:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of these things and we have
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
policies you know on all these things
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
could there be better methods of perhaps
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
broadcasting that to parents and the
 
04:41:24.390 --> 04:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
public that we have a policy on
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
community engagement
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
fine that that's that that may be a
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
legitimate legitimate concern within
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
within a particular community so um
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
again specifically that angle i hadn't i
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
hadn't considered representative but
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's a good question
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then a follow-up yes
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're working with just your member
 
04:41:50.948 --> 04:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
districts right
 
04:41:50.958 --> 04:41:51.830 align:start position:0%
districts right
um

04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
by and large yes i mean we have most
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
school boards in the state and we don't
 
04:41:58.510 --> 04:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
work you know we we work with we have
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
161 members that are members of the
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
nhsba new hampshire school boards
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
association we work with them and we
 
04:42:07.030 --> 04:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
also work very closely with the
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
superintendents as well too
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay because i was thinking about how
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
this might help
 
04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
the other school boards yeah well
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
the ones that are not members of nhsba
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
are typically either districts that do
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
not have schools there are some small
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
schools up on the mountain there's
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
districts in the mountains that they
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't have they don't have a facility
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
they got 20 kids so they put them on a
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
bus and ship them over the mountain
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
right um and then some of the other
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
really small like a k through two k
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
through three where the school board
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
meets once a month and it's you know
 
04:42:41.430 --> 04:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
again maybe 15 20 kids in the district
 
04:42:41.440 --> 04:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
again maybe 15 20 kids in the district
so

04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:42:43.270 --> 04:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
they don't i guess they don't feel the
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
need to utilize our services which is
 
04:42:46.560 --> 04:42:48.390 align:start position:0%
need to utilize our services which is
understandable

04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%

04:44:33.270 --> 04:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay there i'm sure is there a
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
minority report
 
04:44:35.920 --> 04:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
minority report
from

04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%

i can find my location here
 
04:45:04.150 --> 04:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
jumping down to
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
i think 1381 was the next bill which we
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
had relative to student school board
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
this bill allows for at least one
 
04:45:26.070 --> 04:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
student member on the school board from
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
each public high school in the district
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
or those people are wondering what the
 
04:45:33.030 --> 04:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
bill is all about
 
04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking to um for a motion from
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i'd like to move uh itl
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
is there a second i'll second
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:50.230 --> 04:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli do you have
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh just that i i don't think this is
 
04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
necessary um
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
local boards can uh have student
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
representatives or not
 
04:46:02.480 --> 04:46:04.310 align:start position:0%
representatives or not
um

04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i just don't see the need for this
 
04:46:05.920 --> 04:46:07.750 align:start position:0%
i i just don't see the need for this
legislation

04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:46:09.430 --> 04:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
and representative moffat
 
04:46:10.868 --> 04:46:10.878 align:start position:0%

further discussion yes representative
woodcock

04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i would disagree with the other two
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
gentlemen i just previously spoke having
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
served on a school board for 20 years
 
04:46:26.708 --> 04:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
um i found it very effective to have the
 
04:46:28.230 --> 04:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
student voice right there particularly
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
with questions about what's going on in
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
the schools i understand it's not a
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
voting delegate but than this data
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
provider put in and that that
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
recognition that students are
 
04:46:41.270 --> 04:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
the clients here they are the people who
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
are servicing and have their input in a
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
school board meeting particularly people
 
04:46:46.708 --> 04:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
who may not have been in school for 20
 
04:46:48.310 --> 04:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
or 30 years i think it's very very
 
04:46:49.830 --> 04:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
critical so i think it's making a
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
mistake not allowing this this access to
 
04:46:53.830 --> 04:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
have young young men and women at a high
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
school level these are young adults
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
these are what a great opportunity for
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
leadership for the future
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
discussion represent cordelia
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes i just add that this is making it
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
mandatory to have a student
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
member but also specifying
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
the number
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
of student representatives because it
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
requires one from each high school at
 
04:47:18.878 --> 04:47:21.030 align:start position:0%
requires one from each high school at
least

04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
least
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative luno
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
04:47:24.638 --> 04:47:26.150 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
and

04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think i think maybe a couple of years
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
ago i may have introduced a bill
 
04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
similar to this or along the same lines
 
04:47:34.070 --> 04:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
as this
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
i served on a school board for 12 years
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
every one of those years we had
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
at least one
 
04:47:42.628 --> 04:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
usually two
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
high school uh students as um as as
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
student members of the board non-voting
 
04:47:50.550 --> 04:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
certainly follows along the lines
 
04:47:55.510 --> 04:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
of this and uh and and really i agree
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
with what um with what representative
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
woodcock was saying in terms of a
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
leadership opportunity but also what
 
04:48:04.788 --> 04:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
what an education in civics uh to be on
 
04:48:07.270 --> 04:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
a governance board and uh and play a
 
04:48:08.948 --> 04:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
role in
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
in governance working with
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
the administration and then working with
 
04:48:17.190 --> 04:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
the the legislative body at uh at school
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
district meetings and it's just a
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunity and i think every
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
high school should uh should provide
 
04:48:25.990 --> 04:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to uh to their students
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
i think students see some parts of
 
04:48:34.080 --> 04:48:35.350 align:start position:0%
i think students see some parts of
schools

04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
and experience some parts of schools
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
that maybe others aren't seeing or
 
04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
aren't as aware of and having that
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
student perspective
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
just as a bringing up issues and i have
 
04:48:49.360 --> 04:48:50.310 align:start position:0%
just as a bringing up issues and i have
heard

04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:48:50.320 --> 04:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
heard
um

04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:56.070 --> 04:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
stories from some people who were
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
this position
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh in their town because and they
 
04:49:01.440 --> 04:49:02.230 align:start position:0%
uh in their town because and they
uh

04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
brought up things to the school board
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
the school board had no idea and which
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
and boy would i have liked to have been
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:49:15.830 --> 04:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
do something like this when i was in
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
my high school
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
because we certainly there were a number
 
04:49:22.470 --> 04:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
of us students who saw things
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
and we were just students and nobody
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
paid any attention to it but i think it
 
04:49:29.190 --> 04:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
would have saved a lot of grief on some
 
04:49:31.270 --> 04:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
on a bunch of students had we been able
 
04:49:34.230 --> 04:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
to have a voice at least to be heard
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
about some of the things that we saw
 
04:49:37.750 --> 04:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative boom
 
04:49:42.470 --> 04:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chad just to bring up uh
 
04:49:44.470 --> 04:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
back in the first year i was on the
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
house education committee
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
i brought the first bill i brought up on
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
this committee was to allow more than
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
one member of the school board because
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
we were having two members
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
and found out that it was illegal but
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
you can't have two but anyway we so
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was my first bill and i think it's
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
a great idea and if some school board
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
does not have it they're missing a lot
 
04:50:12.550 --> 04:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
but one per school high school i think
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that might be a lot best like in
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
manchester or five
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
but and they
 
04:50:19.360 --> 04:50:20.550 align:start position:0%
but and they
rotate

04:50:20.550 --> 04:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
rotate
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's nice to find out what's
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
actually going on in the school
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
but i think the current law is really
 
04:50:27.280 --> 04:50:28.470 align:start position:0%
but i think the current law is really
sufficient

04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
04:50:28.480 --> 04:50:29.350 align:start position:0%
sufficient
um

04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
and for example when i brought up when i
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
did my
 
04:50:32.638 --> 04:50:34.470 align:start position:0%
did my
yrbs

04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
yrbs
 
04:50:35.830 --> 04:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
thing uh
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
the principal when the principal came in
 
04:50:37.760 --> 04:50:38.470 align:start position:0%
the principal when the principal came in
with

04:50:38.470 --> 04:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:50:40.708 --> 04:50:40.718 align:start position:0%
the disastrous results and i mentioned
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
to them no nil the kids all took this as
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
a joke and the school board the student
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative agreed with me so yes you
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
you need that
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
and it'd be nice but you can't do it to
 
04:50:55.030 --> 04:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
have a a private and private thing with
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
your school board to find out what's
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
really going on in the school but you
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
can't do that but yeah i think it's
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
definitely needed but
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
it i think the current law
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
is sufficient thank you
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair one of the joys of my
 
04:51:14.310 --> 04:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
time serving in the legislature were the
 
04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
years that i was the educ legislative
 
04:51:18.628 --> 04:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the new hampshire
 
04:51:21.190 --> 04:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council
 
04:51:23.430 --> 04:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're a group of young people who are
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
appointed to
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
advise the legislature on issues that
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
are important to young people in the
 
04:51:31.750 --> 04:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
state and i'm very proud of the work
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
that they have done in the past and i'm
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
very proud of them this term too
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
although i'm no longer heading them up
 
04:51:40.948 --> 04:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
but i do have here a list of
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
bills that they have been
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
meeting and discussing and deciding what
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
position they would like to take and one
 
04:51:50.948 --> 04:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
of them is this bill
 
04:51:53.030 --> 04:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
i want you to know that they have a
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or an interest group
 
04:51:57.830 --> 04:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
that works on education issues and that
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
group has
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
recommended that this bill ought to pass
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i want you to know that from them
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
that that's where they stand on on this
 
04:52:07.830 --> 04:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
issue and um
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
they're really special kids they're good
 
04:52:12.628 --> 04:52:12.638 align:start position:0%
it's good a good organization thank you

should be i have a question how does
 
04:52:20.230 --> 04:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
confidential confidentiality fit into
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
this if
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh something comes up to the school
 
04:52:26.948 --> 04:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.990 --> 04:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the one of the questions i
 
04:52:33.600 --> 04:52:34.550 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the one of the questions i
have

04:52:34.550 --> 04:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
represented muffin in a second please
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
i have is the legislation states that we
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
have on the books right now
 
04:52:43.750 --> 04:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
may choose by a simple majority to to
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
add one or more
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
so currently
 
04:52:51.830 --> 04:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
you can have one represented from each
 
04:52:53.990 --> 04:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
high school if that's uh individual
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
board so deems it necessary so i'm
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
trying to find determine my own mind
 
04:53:00.550 --> 04:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
here how has this really changed what
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative moffitt
 
04:53:10.470 --> 04:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:53:12.948 --> 04:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
i agree with uh the sentiments that
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
several of you said about the
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
nice thing about having involvement
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
civic involvement by students i i get
 
04:53:22.470 --> 04:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
that and i
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
my little concern of this a couple of
 
04:53:28.070 --> 04:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
them uh you know would they
 
04:53:28.080 --> 04:53:28.948 align:start position:0%
them uh you know would they
as

04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
members of the school board they be
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
expected or allowed to attend or not
 
04:53:35.510 --> 04:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
attend non-public sessions
 
04:53:37.510 --> 04:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
would probably be a local uh
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
call on that probably not
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
but but beyond that uh a hallmark of how
 
04:53:44.788 --> 04:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
we do business in new hampshire is
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
school board local control so here's
 
04:53:50.310 --> 04:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
here's a bill uh philosophically that we
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
have the state coming in and saying you
 
04:53:54.550 --> 04:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
shall have a student i think it's great
 
04:53:56.550 --> 04:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
that they do they should just the notion
 
04:53:58.470 --> 04:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
of the state saying you shall have at
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
least one student that's just something
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
04:54:04.310 --> 04:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
was you know bought me just a little bit
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
which is why i seconded the uh
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
further discussion represented woodcock
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
thank you just very brief thank you
 
04:54:12.638 --> 04:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
thank you just very brief thank you
chairman

04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:54:16.470 --> 04:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
194 223 tell you exactly what the school
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
in school school young says kenny can't
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
do uh in section five deals with
 
04:54:22.310 --> 04:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
nelson's question
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
what it is now is enabling it's enabling
 
04:54:24.400 --> 04:54:25.990 align:start position:0%
what it is now is enabling it's enabling
legislation

04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:54:28.230 --> 04:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
they have laid out whoever wrote this it
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
could have been
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative obama's group way back
 
04:54:30.958 --> 04:54:32.550 align:start position:0%
representative obama's group way back
then

04:54:32.550 --> 04:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
but in either case it tells you exactly
 
04:54:35.590 --> 04:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
what they do and they're good at it this
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
just says it gives the opportunity
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
because some schools don't want them
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't have them don't know they should
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is just it's just a powerful piece
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
to have in your schools to have a
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
youngster there who's in the high school
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
as we said who knows what's going on
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
and anne is the conduit from the high
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
school students to the board
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
it provides another opportunity for
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
their input
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:56.958 --> 04:54:58.470 align:start position:0%
thank you
represent

04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:55:00.310 --> 04:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it's been my experience in uh
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
windham uh that if kids have grievances
 
04:55:05.190 --> 04:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
they come in and testify themselves
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
representative litchfield
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:13.830 --> 04:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
if i could throw this out to all of you
 
04:55:15.750 --> 04:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that have spoken up on this or have
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
a thought
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
here's my concern my concern is just
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
as an elected official and as a board
 
04:55:22.000 --> 04:55:22.948 align:start position:0%
as an elected official and as a board
member

04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
member
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
whenever i've spoken up about something
 
04:55:26.948 --> 04:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
that's not very popular
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
i get the email the next day that says
 
04:55:30.550 --> 04:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
come into my office
 
04:55:31.910 --> 04:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
or call me
 
04:55:35.430 --> 04:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
as an adult board member so my concern
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about let's say
 
04:55:38.390 --> 04:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
students and i respect what you're
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
saying i don't disagree but students
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
will bring things to light i worry for
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
those students especially in any
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
district or the larger district but if
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're bringing things
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
to light that may not be comfortable for
 
04:55:51.990 --> 04:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
all involved
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
how is that for the students that night
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
or the next day when it comes to the
 
04:55:57.990 --> 04:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
board when it comes to the staff members
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
04:56:01.350 --> 04:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
the other students and parents in the
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
district um
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
i just i worry for them i guess is my
 
04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
point um and
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
they can already do this anyway but i
 
04:56:11.430 --> 04:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
just want you to know that's this is
 
04:56:12.948 --> 04:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
where my thought process is coming from
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
if we mandate it
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
04:56:19.270 --> 04:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then represent cornell yeah i just
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to that in that if
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
students have these concerns and try to
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
bring them to a board and are just
 
04:56:28.948 --> 04:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
ignored because they're just students
 
04:56:30.948 --> 04:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
and have to see and feel the
 
04:56:34.310 --> 04:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
consequences of that that is also
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
disturbing and troubling
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
represent cornell
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
well in manchester you know we do have
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
the four high schools and there are
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
student representatives now from it and
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see it as airing grievances or
 
04:56:49.750 --> 04:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
bringing bad things forward to the
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
committee as i think i said when this
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill first came up
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
one student who's a representative
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
rewrote the school dress code which i
 
04:57:00.628 --> 04:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
think hadn't been done since the 80s so
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
it was time to redo and now reflects you
 
04:57:06.230 --> 04:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
know what students within reason and
 
04:57:08.550 --> 04:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
they were very responsible about writing
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
this i mean nothing inappropriate isn't
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
it so i see it as a positive thing and
 
04:57:14.070 --> 04:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
when i've watched and seen what they've
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
reported they talk about what's going on
 
04:57:18.390 --> 04:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
in their schools things they
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
legitimately have concerns about they
 
04:57:23.030 --> 04:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
report good things and they and they add
 
04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the discussion and they're there to
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
answer questions if the school board is
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
discussing something and they want to
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
find out something so i think this is a
 
04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
great idea
 
04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
mr christina
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
if he had any idea how many school
 
04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
boards in the state of new hampshire
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
actually have student representation on
 
04:57:46.718 --> 04:57:52.788 align:start position:0%
actually have student representation on
it

04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%

thank you for the question
 
04:57:55.590 --> 04:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative i don't know we don't
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.190 --> 04:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh in response to
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative tanner's question
 
04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh it was
 
04:58:07.760 --> 04:58:08.788 align:start position:0%
uh it was
with

04:58:08.788 --> 04:58:08.798 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
great surprise that i discovered as a
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
result of the legislative hearing on
 
04:58:15.030 --> 04:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:58:15.040 --> 04:58:16.070 align:start position:0%
this bill
that

04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:18.708 --> 04:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
my school district does not have any
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
student representation on the school
 
04:58:21.200 --> 04:58:22.070 align:start position:0%
student representation on the school
board

04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:58:24.868 --> 04:58:24.878 align:start position:0%
so in looking and digging into the
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
statutes i think some of the confusion
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
comes between 189 1c
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
and 194 23 f
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
because there are maze in 189
 
04:58:37.440 --> 04:58:39.030 align:start position:0%
because there are maze in 189
1c

04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
1c
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
and shells in
 
04:58:44.550 --> 04:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
194 23 f
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that um
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
yeah some i think the student voice is
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
inherently important in every school
 
04:58:53.920 --> 04:58:56.150 align:start position:0%
inherently important in every school
district

04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not we're happy
 
04:58:59.830 --> 04:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
with the message they're delivering we
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
need to listen to what they have to say
 
04:59:04.550 --> 04:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh to make room for them at the
 
04:59:04.560 --> 04:59:05.590 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity for the

05:00:56.550 --> 05:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:01:04.628 --> 05:01:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative hall i just asked the
 
05:01:07.830 --> 05:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
question so what if
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
the school board um
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
it says they must have one if they put
 
05:01:13.830 --> 05:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
it out there and ask for one so what
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
would happen if a student didn't come
 
05:01:15.600 --> 05:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
would happen if a student didn't come
forward

05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.150 --> 05:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
representing moan i think i have the
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
answer to that in 194 it says
 
05:01:33.270 --> 05:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
that the school must select one or more
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
so i think the responsibility goes back
 
05:01:39.670 --> 05:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
to the high school or uh whatever school
 
05:01:41.910 --> 05:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is that is selecting the student
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
great thanks
 
05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
but within the school there's also the
 
05:01:48.470 --> 05:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
student government or the student
 
05:01:48.480 --> 05:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
student government or the student
council

05:01:49.910 --> 05:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
council
 
05:01:51.750 --> 05:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
which you're going to have to have to
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
replace somebody that leaves at
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
mid-year or
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
already graduated something such as that
 
05:01:58.958 --> 05:01:59.750 align:start position:0%
already graduated something such as that
so

05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
it does imply that
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
at least state to me that you would have
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
to have a student government of some
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
kind in that high school
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
or student election for the position and
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have in conway the over election so i
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
mean there's it's not it hasn't been an
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
issue of students wanting to get there
 
05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
they all like the opportunity
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
and i i would think that most of them
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
have student councils too but you know
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
um you may not who knows okay uh we got
 
05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
a motion on the table
 
05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:37.670 --> 05:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
so the motion on the table is ought to

they've been on the table for quite a
while

05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:45.760 --> 05:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%

great
 
05:07:12.070 --> 05:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh chairman ladd okay uh was there a
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
second on the uh
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you um
 
05:07:19.910 --> 05:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment which i'm uh putting forth
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
changes the statutory number on the bill
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
from 189 10 a which was in
 
05:07:27.520 --> 05:07:28.310 align:start position:0%
from 189 10 a which was in
the

05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
bill as stated that comes under an area
 
05:07:33.430 --> 05:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
in legislation called studies which
 
05:07:35.830 --> 05:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're kind of using that for things like
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
health and physical education etc etc i
 
05:07:38.480 --> 05:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
health and physical education etc etc i
think

05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
it rather belongs under school board
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
duties under 189 colon 1a
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
which is specifically titled duties to
 
05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
provide education and what this
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
05:07:56.708 --> 05:07:56.718 align:start position:0%
upon a request of a parent a guardian
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
or a
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
a member of the public the school board
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
shall within 10 business days provide
 
05:08:05.910 --> 05:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
adopted curriculum and instructional
 
05:08:05.920 --> 05:08:06.948 align:start position:0%
adopted curriculum and instructional
goals

05:08:06.948 --> 05:08:06.958 align:start position:0%
goals
 
05:08:09.030 --> 05:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
used by for providing students learning
 
05:08:09.040 --> 05:08:10.470 align:start position:0%
used by for providing students learning
experiences

05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
05:08:12.070 --> 05:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the knowledge and skills
 
05:08:14.788 --> 05:08:14.798 align:start position:0%
taught in grade level course and program
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
at each school operated and governed in
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
the district
 
05:08:21.190 --> 05:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
the added language there to 189 one
 
05:08:23.270 --> 05:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's various terminology in there
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
that replicates what was already in law
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
which speaks to instructional goals as
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the school boards and
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
it also talks about
 
05:08:34.080 --> 05:08:35.030 align:start position:0%
it also talks about
the

05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:37.590 --> 05:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
the govern in its district
 
05:08:39.750 --> 05:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
which we talked about down below
 
05:08:39.760 --> 05:08:41.190 align:start position:0%
which we talked about down below
um

05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:08:45.270 --> 05:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
in online um
 
05:08:48.470 --> 05:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
seven it also says uh each school
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
operated and governed in its district
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
and so the language which is do have
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
placed in the amending language is
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
already in 189 but this specifically
 
05:09:01.590 --> 05:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
says that if a parent requests it
 
05:09:03.510 --> 05:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's available to them it should be
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
available to them within 10 business
 
05:09:09.830 --> 05:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
days of the request thank you
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
05:09:11.520 --> 05:09:12.708 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
cornell

05:09:12.708 --> 05:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
cornell
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
i i well it's a question um so this
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
takes out the part of that it's
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
accessible on the website and that
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a physical copy available
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
everything that's in the original bill
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
is how to accept this blackened area
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the amendment okay so how
 
05:09:31.510 --> 05:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
further yes how would it be made
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
available you can say um it's on the
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
website go to this link and
 
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
um it's available upon request so it
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
does not have to be posted on the
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
website it could be
 
05:09:47.270 --> 05:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the principal's office it could be
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
located in the library a parent would
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
come in and have access to or this dual
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
district office uh it doesn't say
 
05:09:56.310 --> 05:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
anything about having to post it or make
 
05:09:58.868 --> 05:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
copies or anything of that sort
 
05:10:00.868 --> 05:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative ellison uh thank you mr
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh rick just a question on on
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
language or interpretation language
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
lines 10 and 11
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
specifically adopted curriculum and
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
instructional goals
 
05:10:13.840 --> 05:10:14.708 align:start position:0%
instructional goals
i

05:10:14.708 --> 05:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i'm trying to
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
in my own mind figure out whether in
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
adopted curriculum
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
is is one category and instructional
 
05:10:27.030 --> 05:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
goals are is a second category are those
 
05:10:28.788 --> 05:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
two things tied together and i would
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
only i would only raise the question in
 
05:10:33.190 --> 05:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
terms of if it's a book
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
that a
 
05:10:36.470 --> 05:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
a parent objects to
 
05:10:39.190 --> 05:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
is that are we talking about part of the
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
curriculum the book is part of the
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
curriculum so therefore it comes under
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
or more general adopted curriculum
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
instructional goals which would not
 
05:10:50.708 --> 05:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
include that sort of question
 
05:10:50.718 --> 05:10:51.670 align:start position:0%
include that sort of question
the

05:10:51.670 --> 05:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
the definition which we have for the
 
05:10:55.030 --> 05:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
word curriculum
 
05:10:56.948 --> 05:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
if you look in statute
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm reading it from it's inadequacy
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
in in the content of adequacy it says
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum means the lessons in academic
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
content taught in school or in a
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
specific course or program
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay um so we're talking about that
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
academic content i.e the knowledge and
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
skills which are taught
 
05:11:19.030 --> 05:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh and but this is specific of the
 
05:11:20.550 --> 05:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
approved stuff
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
by the
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
by the board
 
05:11:26.550 --> 05:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
05:11:29.750 --> 05:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
or it's not adopted adopted
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
05:11:33.270 --> 05:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
represent luna thank you very much mr
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
05:11:37.590 --> 05:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
so so to the um
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
looking at this paragraph um
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's being amended here uh it appears
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:11:48.150 --> 05:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
all about instruction
 
05:11:49.350 --> 05:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
establishing the structure
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
accountability advocacy and delivery of
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
instruction and that's what school board
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for establishing
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
the structure accountability averaging
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
delivery of instruction and then it goes
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
goes down through that diverse
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
instructional policies that establish
 
05:12:12.788 --> 05:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
instructional goals
 
05:12:15.430 --> 05:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
and so in the bold
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're referencing and this this sort of
 
05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
goes to what representative allison was
 
05:12:21.510 --> 05:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
was i think inquiring about you're
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
referencing two things you're
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
representing you're you're referencing
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
adopted curriculum and you're
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
referencing instructional goals but this
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph only talks about instructional
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
goals being established by the board
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and and i could certainly understand
 
05:12:40.310 --> 05:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
that those instructional goals having
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
been established in roman two
 
05:12:44.948 --> 05:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
should be made available to parents upon
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
request but the adopted curriculum
 
05:12:50.868 --> 05:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
in the bold here doesn't tie into
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
anything that's in roman two however it
 
05:12:53.760 --> 05:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
anything that's in roman two however it
does

05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
186 colon 11
 
05:13:03.910 --> 05:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
roman 9
 
05:13:03.920 --> 05:13:05.270 align:start position:0%
roman 9
c

05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
c
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
which at the and this is on page 308
 
05:13:11.510 --> 05:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the yellow annotated
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
the rsas
 
05:13:12.958 --> 05:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
the rsas
um

05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
sort of sort of
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
a third of the way down the left-hand
 
05:13:18.240 --> 05:13:20.230 align:start position:0%
a third of the way down the left-hand
column

05:13:20.230 --> 05:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
column
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
so 186
 
05:13:25.430 --> 05:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
186 11. roman
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
would i say roman 9 c
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh quote to the extent practicable a
 
05:13:32.948 --> 05:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
school district shall make curriculum so
 
05:13:34.948 --> 05:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about curriculum make
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum course materials available to
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
parents or legal guardians for review
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
upon request
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
the name of the parent or guard or legal
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
guardian and any specific reason to
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
disclose to school officials for the
 
05:13:48.550 --> 05:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
objection of the material shall not be
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
public information shall be excluded
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
so so i guess
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would i would i would suggest that
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
maybe the
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
the adopted curriculum part is already
 
05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
being provided for
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
an existing law
 
05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
the instructional goals i think is a
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
good catch and and has not been
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
addressed as as sort of like a that that
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
that it can be requested and the
 
05:14:25.520 --> 05:14:26.868 align:start position:0%
that it can be requested and the
um

05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:28.788 --> 05:14:28.798 align:start position:0%
district shall provide
 
05:14:28.798 --> 05:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
district shall provide
so

05:14:31.750 --> 05:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
what what i'm trying to do is that
 
05:14:38.550 --> 05:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
within the adopted rules for this state
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at ed 306
 
05:14:41.520 --> 05:14:44.230 align:start position:0%
if you were to look at ed 306
0.14

05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
0.14
 
05:14:46.230 --> 05:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
which deals with the local school board
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
shall require that each school has an
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
instructional program which includes the
 
05:14:52.868 --> 05:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
following if you go down to item number
 
05:14:52.878 --> 05:14:53.750 align:start position:0%
following if you go down to item number
four

05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
it says instructional materials and
 
05:14:55.520 --> 05:14:57.910 align:start position:0%
it says instructional materials and
resources

05:14:57.910 --> 05:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
resources
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
match to the appropriate skill levels of
 
05:14:59.920 --> 05:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
match to the appropriate skill levels of
students

05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
students
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of this that we have that uh folks
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
are looking at i'm trying to write this
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
in such a way
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
that it's it's uh
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
providing to the
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
the person requesting the information
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
which is available
 
05:15:21.990 --> 05:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
and the the school board should have
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
available or the school district or the
 
05:15:24.000 --> 05:15:24.868 align:start position:0%
available or the school district or the
school

05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:15:27.830 --> 05:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
and and right now according to rule we
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
should all have instructional materials
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
and resources that match
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the outcomes were or the student
 
05:15:35.430 --> 05:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
learning that we're
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
working towards there's got to be some
 
05:15:40.868 --> 05:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
material in these schools instructional
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
goals instructional resources
 
05:15:44.948 --> 05:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
instructional materials because
 
05:15:46.230 --> 05:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know you write down i don't want to
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
get in a laundry list of things i don't
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
want to get into writing down the
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
textbooks and then we get all those
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
textbooks down there and we're putting
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
them on the web and let's say getting
 
05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
into the uh um
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
the materials used in your preschool
 
05:16:02.708 --> 05:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
program or your kindergarten program
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
where you're getting all or the mortons
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
in math blocks for teaching mathematics
 
05:16:09.590 --> 05:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
which are all kind you can't do that
 
05:16:11.910 --> 05:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't have to do that but
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
there should be some
 
05:16:16.948 --> 05:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
curriculum outlines or instructional
 
05:16:16.958 --> 05:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
curriculum outlines or instructional
goals

05:16:18.470 --> 05:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
goals
 
05:16:20.470 --> 05:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
materials resources
 
05:16:22.868 --> 05:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
available so a parent can come in and
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
see oh that's what's being taught my
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
child at this particular grade level or
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
in this course or in this program which
 
05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
is a combination of courses
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of this the intent is
 
05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
not is to get away from all the laundry
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
list to get away from the education
 
05:16:41.270 --> 05:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
alphabet soup and to just make it
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
complain and easily understood and there
 
05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
may be some room for interpretation i i
 
05:16:48.628 --> 05:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
don't mind that i what i think we need
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
to do is just
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
be open and have the materials which
 
05:16:54.550 --> 05:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
we're using available i in no way i'm
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
expecting to have lesson plans
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
read and reviewed by the parent um
 
05:17:02.070 --> 05:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's the only one that should be
 
05:17:03.270 --> 05:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
overseeing that is the building
 
05:17:07.270 --> 05:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
principle or the supervising teacher
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
so that's where it stops so what i'm
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do is get something in here
 
05:17:14.070 --> 05:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
which kind of responds to what some of
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
the parents are requested
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
but it's something that i think's being
 
05:17:18.000 --> 05:17:19.030 align:start position:0%
but it's something that i think's being
done

05:17:19.030 --> 05:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:17:21.670 --> 05:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think that's the stuff is available
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the first step is
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
you have to come ask talk to teacher i'm
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
sure you'll get it immediately
 
05:17:29.670 --> 05:17:29.680 align:start position:0%
or then you talk to the principal to
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
whomever and you'll be directed in the
 
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
right direction so that's what i'm
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
trying to emphasize and and mr chair i'm
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
on board with what you with what you
 
05:17:39.270 --> 05:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
just said
 
05:17:40.390 --> 05:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:17:40.400 --> 05:17:41.270 align:start position:0%
and and
and

05:17:41.270 --> 05:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:43.670 --> 05:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
and specifically where you just said
 
05:17:46.070 --> 05:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the the curriculum can be is
 
05:17:48.390 --> 05:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
available and may be requested
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh by a parent and shall be provided by
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
the school district because it's right
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
there in 18611
 
05:17:56.550 --> 05:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
what what isn't and i'm i'm saying it's
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
a good catch here is that as school
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
boards also establish instructional
 
05:18:01.920 --> 05:18:03.030 align:start position:0%
boards also establish instructional
goals

05:18:03.030 --> 05:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
goals
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
that that that school boards establish
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
the instructional goals and those
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
instructional goals um may be requested
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
and shall be provided
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know i would i would say this this
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
amendment so as not to duplicate what's
 
05:18:20.310 --> 05:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
already in 8611
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and so that it focus on on the the
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
the purpose of roman 2 in the amendment
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
which is instruction
 
05:18:28.638 --> 05:18:29.830 align:start position:0%
which is instruction
um

05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
and the school boards establishing
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
instructional goals that that the bold
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
focus on on
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
making the the instructional goals
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
available within the 10-day
 
05:18:41.760 --> 05:18:43.670 align:start position:0%
available within the 10-day
window

05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
window
 
05:18:45.270 --> 05:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
what about instructional materials and
 
05:18:48.550 --> 05:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
resources that's spoken in in ed 306
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find it there well
 
05:18:52.868 --> 05:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
you're not finding it here either so
 
05:18:55.350 --> 05:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm saying don't don't the parents want
 
05:18:57.510 --> 05:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
to know that
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
what's your what you're using as far as
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
so i can also have right now the
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
textbooks are not going home in my my
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
district we don't have textbooks anymore
 
05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be nice for a parent to
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
have something that they can
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
themselves update themselves and how to
 
05:19:16.390 --> 05:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
teach this particular lesson or provide
 
05:19:18.390 --> 05:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know some information for them and i
 
05:19:19.990 --> 05:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
think you were saying that that's
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
already available and i think it is
 
05:19:26.070 --> 05:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
available in 186.11. 186.
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
yeah roman 9
 
05:19:30.150 --> 05:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
page 308 okay about a third of the way
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
down the left-hand column okay
 
05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
i trust you
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah okay that's the one where
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know i read earlier today
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
right right yeah yeah that's why i had
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
it at my fingertips
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
so basically what this is that says when
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
practical and and uh
 
05:19:51.030 --> 05:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
they will be made available
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
um it says to the extent practicable
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think that's a very important
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
piece too because that means if it's if
 
05:20:00.230 --> 05:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's available electronically then it
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
may be provided electronically it's
 
05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
available in print then it may be
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:12.550 --> 05:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i i you know
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative hopson i kind of like the
 
05:20:16.390 --> 05:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
word review and you able to come in you
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
can look at the stuff uh i don't know
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
how you're ever going to get this all in
 
05:20:20.878 --> 05:20:22.230 align:start position:0%
how you're ever going to get this all in
online

05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
well if it's already possible yes you
 
05:20:26.868 --> 05:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
can't do it and it's constantly changing
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
that's why to the extent practicable
 
05:20:30.548 --> 05:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
isn't important yeah
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
okay and it's an existing statute
 
05:20:34.230 --> 05:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative hobson
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know which one of you is sharing
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
this at this point
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question i
 
05:20:43.590 --> 05:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
have a couple of questions uh first one
 
05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
is um
 
05:20:49.110 --> 05:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
the the three of you senior veterans
 
05:20:51.510 --> 05:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
are going through the rsas very quickly
 
05:20:55.430 --> 05:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm a little confused as to which
 
05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
rsas you're talking about i've heard
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
school districts mentioned michelle
 
05:21:04.150 --> 05:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
provide and i this particular
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
amendment references school boards
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
so um that is my first question which
 
05:21:11.520 --> 05:21:12.390 align:start position:0%
so um that is my first question which
if

05:21:12.390 --> 05:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
all i i think that the most recent
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
discussion was in relation to 186 roman
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
9 c
 
05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
on page 308 yes correct and that's
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's school district
 
05:21:28.230 --> 05:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
and the amendment here is school board
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
um attorney fenton might be able to
 
05:21:34.390 --> 05:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
clarify this but i think school board
 
05:21:35.910 --> 05:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
and school district are almost used
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
interchangeably throughout the statutes
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up question
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up so as a
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
as a prior school board member i don't
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
know that i was ever
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
i probably had the ability to request
 
05:21:54.788 --> 05:21:54.798 align:start position:0%
curriculum but it was not available at
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
my fingertips which uh and i don't know
 
05:21:59.670 --> 05:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
that it should be i'm not saying that
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
but if it's a duty um and the other
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
right but it's a duty because it's
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
because the school board's the governing
 
05:22:08.150 --> 05:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
body right so so it doesn't mean that
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the school board member would actually
 
05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
be providing the curriculum but but the
 
05:22:12.878 --> 05:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
be providing the curriculum but but the
gov

05:22:13.750 --> 05:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
gov
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
the governing body has the responsible
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
for making sure that the school that the
 
05:22:17.760 --> 05:22:18.868 align:start position:0%
for making sure that the school that the
district

05:22:18.868 --> 05:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
provides it so it would come through the
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
the the administration okay yeah it
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come from so it's this is kind
 
05:22:28.868 --> 05:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
when practicable
 
05:22:32.150 --> 05:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
um to me
 
05:22:32.160 --> 05:22:33.590 align:start position:0%
um to me
i

05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:22:36.070 --> 05:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
seems um
 
05:22:40.390 --> 05:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:22:41.830 --> 05:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
an interpretive
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
question so and i'd maybe you know
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is just me as a school board member
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
parent type of a representative
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
perspective right right yeah it doesn't
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
say when practical practicable it says
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the extent practicable and and that's
 
05:22:59.910 --> 05:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
an important distinction because because
 
05:23:02.230 --> 05:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
it means is it available this way is it
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
available this way
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
is it available that that you come in
 
05:23:08.310 --> 05:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
and review it in in
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
a classroom because they only have one
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
textbook left or something like that
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's what that means
 
05:23:16.868 --> 05:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
would you uh interpret that um your
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
comment to the extent practical if they
 
05:23:22.470 --> 05:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
have it available in hard copy form um a
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
parent coming in and wishing an
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
electronic form it would not be to the
 
05:23:29.270 --> 05:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
extent practical to then convert it to
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
electronic formatting yeah i i think
 
05:23:35.190 --> 05:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's a fair um interpretation of that
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a 400 page textbook
 
05:23:40.470 --> 05:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that if it's if it's
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't know yeah course outline or
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
something like that sure scan it in it's
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
probably on a word document somewhere so
 
05:23:52.830 --> 05:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
i i mean
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah uh further questions representative
 
05:23:55.440 --> 05:23:56.788 align:start position:0%
yeah uh further questions representative
tanner

05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
tanner
 
05:23:59.190 --> 05:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um you know i think a lot of
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is in course of studies i mean and
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
i i read this and as a teacher a former
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
teacher i have no idea
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
what i would have to provide i mean i
 
05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
really don't um
 
05:24:11.120 --> 05:24:12.628 align:start position:0%
really don't um
they

05:24:12.628 --> 05:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
the courses that i taught
 
05:24:16.470 --> 05:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have textbooks and most courses
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
don't anymore because textbooks are out
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
of sight expensive number one and within
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
a couple years they're outdated and so
 
05:24:25.750 --> 05:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
long ago the schools decided that was a
 
05:24:28.390 --> 05:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
good way to save money and so
 
05:24:32.470 --> 05:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of course material is is online
 
05:24:35.350 --> 05:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
but i i just turned to kearsarge's
 
05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
program of study and looked up
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
personal finance which is one of the
 
05:24:42.470 --> 05:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
things that we kind of pushed them to do
 
05:24:44.708 --> 05:24:44.718 align:start position:0%
and it says this semester-long course is
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
designed to introduce students to basic
 
05:24:49.350 --> 05:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
personal financial skills
 
05:24:51.030 --> 05:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
students will learn about investing
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
managing their money credit buying a
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
home vehicle risk management and
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
consumer rights to me that is their
 
05:25:01.590 --> 05:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
instructional goals students will learn
 
05:25:03.990 --> 05:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
the use of checking and savings accounts
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
and become knowledgeable in the process
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
of planning for retirement
 
05:25:07.760 --> 05:25:08.948 align:start position:0%
of planning for retirement
um

05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
to me
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh i've met the
 
05:25:14.070 --> 05:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's what i would
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
think that a parent would want to see
 
05:25:15.760 --> 05:25:16.548 align:start position:0%
think that a parent would want to see
now

05:25:16.548 --> 05:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
05:25:21.270 --> 05:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
it almost seems like
 
05:25:22.390 --> 05:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
05:25:24.310 --> 05:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
for providing students learning
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
experiences we're digging into
 
05:25:28.948 --> 05:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
what happens in the classroom which is
 
05:25:31.590 --> 05:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
instruction and and
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think we've talked about this before
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
but teaching is an art
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
it isn't something that
 
05:25:39.750 --> 05:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
maybe as a student teacher or first or
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
second year teacher you've got
 
05:25:44.150 --> 05:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
everything mapped out you might even map
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
it out by time blocks um
 
05:25:47.360 --> 05:25:48.310 align:start position:0%
it out by time blocks um
because

05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:25:49.990 --> 05:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're learning as you're going
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
what what goes over what doesn't
 
05:25:54.628 --> 05:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
you know how to work with kids you're
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
learning a lot of things as you're doing
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
it as you get more experienced you know
 
05:26:02.070 --> 05:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're able to flip a
 
05:26:02.080 --> 05:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
you're you're able to flip a
instruction

05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
on a dime because you realize right away
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
that you need to take a different avenue
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know i just
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh we have competencies that are kind of
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh what the expected knowledge and
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
skills are at grade level in each area
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
most i think every school has
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
competencies we now have these things
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
called rubrics
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
which are the ways students get to the
 
05:26:30.548 --> 05:26:30.558 align:start position:0%
competencies and those are you know
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
right out there for the students they're
 
05:26:33.590 --> 05:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
given to the students so the students
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
know what they have to accomplish
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what it is in elementary
 
05:26:38.240 --> 05:26:39.190 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what it is in elementary
school

05:26:39.190 --> 05:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming middle school is pretty
 
05:26:42.628 --> 05:26:42.638 align:start position:0%
close to high school on a lot of these
 
05:26:44.390 --> 05:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
things but
 
05:26:44.400 --> 05:26:45.830 align:start position:0%
things but
again

05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know i realize what you're trying to
 
05:26:47.760 --> 05:26:48.628 align:start position:0%
you know i realize what you're trying to
do

05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:26:51.510 --> 05:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
but as a teacher
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
what i would have to provide and that's
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why i i have difficulty with
 
05:26:58.480 --> 05:26:59.430 align:start position:0%
and that's why i i have difficulty with
this

05:26:59.430 --> 05:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
my recollection from the uh introduction
 
05:27:06.548 --> 05:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
by the chair is that um instructional
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
goals is referred to in line eight
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
where the chair was coming from in
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
his drafting here
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
are there further comments uh
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
representative lacus
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the the thing i like about this
 
05:27:25.910 --> 05:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
that i objected to on all the other ones
 
05:27:29.990 --> 05:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.000 --> 05:27:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
making

05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:27:35.910 --> 05:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum etc available to
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
parents is that the other ones all had
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
you do it beforehand
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
and as rep tanner was saying as a
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
teacher you switch on a dime you know
 
05:27:46.548 --> 05:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
you're planning you're changing and all
 
05:27:48.708 --> 05:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
of that stuff but this doesn't have to
 
05:27:51.750 --> 05:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
do it beforehand it has to do it
 
05:27:54.310 --> 05:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
within 10 business days after they
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
request so in my mind this is
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
what i am doing what i have done
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
and so all those things you said most of
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
them are online and it would be easy for
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
me as a teacher to send those off
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
because i've done them already they're
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
already there i'm not saying what i will
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
be doing in the future other than my
 
05:28:17.830 --> 05:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
goals right my instructional goals but
 
05:28:19.670 --> 05:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
as far as the other stuff it doesn't
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
seem to be asking and maybe i'm reading
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
it wrong
 
05:28:23.840 --> 05:28:24.708 align:start position:0%
it wrong
um

05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
but that was what i like because it's
 
05:28:29.350 --> 05:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
not saying 10 days in advance i have to
 
05:28:31.670 --> 05:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
tell all the things i'm going to do
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
which the others did it just seems to be
 
05:28:35.270 --> 05:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
saying i have to let them know what i'm
 
05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
doing and so i'm doing it so i can put
 
05:28:38.160 --> 05:28:39.110 align:start position:0%
doing and so i'm doing it so i can put
in

05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:28:42.150 --> 05:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
what i'm doing right the things i've
 
05:28:45.030 --> 05:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
just done and and if i didn't give a
 
05:28:46.628 --> 05:28:46.638 align:start position:0%
parent enough i'm sure they're going to
 
05:28:46.638 --> 05:28:47.670 align:start position:0%
parent enough i'm sure they're going to
say

05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know i was really looking more for
 
05:28:49.760 --> 05:28:50.628 align:start position:0%
you know i was really looking more for
this

05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then i can accommodate them but
 
05:28:54.948 --> 05:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's why i'm supporting this
 
05:28:56.390 --> 05:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
one i didn't support any of the other
 
05:28:56.400 --> 05:28:57.270 align:start position:0%
one i didn't support any of the other
ones

05:28:57.270 --> 05:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
ones
 
05:28:59.670 --> 05:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
05:29:00.788 --> 05:29:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:02.548 --> 05:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
representative cordelia i just have a
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
question so i'm looking at the third
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
grade mathematics curriculum map that's
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
on our school district website
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
it starts off with a paragraph about in
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
grade three students continue to work on
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
numeration geometry measurement and
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
problem solving blah blah blah blah blah
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
student multiplication division graphing
 
05:29:25.910 --> 05:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
but okay so there's a a paragraph
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
narrative about what the kids are going
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
to do during the year
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
and then underneath that are the course
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
standards and that though that says by
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year a student
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
and then it says
 
05:29:42.390 --> 05:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
operations and algebraic thinking and it
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
lists what they should do numbers and
 
05:29:46.150 --> 05:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
operations in base 10
 
05:29:49.670 --> 05:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
fractions measurement data and there are
 
05:29:52.070 --> 05:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
instructional points there
 
05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
would that cover
 
05:29:56.310 --> 05:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
what it is that is being asked for in
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bill if there was a narrative about
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
what the kids would do during the year
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
and then course standards listed out
 
05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
i think you just identified the
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
instructional goals that are for the
 
05:30:09.830 --> 05:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
third grade
 
05:30:11.830 --> 05:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
right that's what we would like to have
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
communicated to the parent you know via
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
this method here the then
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
if the parent can review that somewhere
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
then say okay now i'm going to go down
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
the hallway and talk to mrs taylor here
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
and and find out how she's teaching
 
05:30:27.270 --> 05:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
fractions or how about how little
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
johnny's doing oh yeah and and uh to
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
follow that up and say
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
where my problem has been when i've been
 
05:30:38.310 --> 05:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
um an elementary principal
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
parents would get really torqued off
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
by the end of fourth grade kids still
 
05:30:43.990 --> 05:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
didn't know their multiplication tables
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
right and that was a commonly known fact
 
05:30:49.350 --> 05:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
that by the time you leave fourth grade
 
05:30:51.510 --> 05:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
you should know those times tables and
 
05:30:53.430 --> 05:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
be able to do some long division
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
and so they come in and say okay what
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
are the expectations the established
 
05:30:59.270 --> 05:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
goals for mathematics at the fourth
 
05:30:59.280 --> 05:31:00.230 align:start position:0%
goals for mathematics at the fourth
grade

05:31:00.230 --> 05:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
grade
 
05:31:02.230 --> 05:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
and we would let them know by christmas
 
05:31:04.150 --> 05:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
time we expect them to have this stuff
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
because we got to get under other things
 
05:31:08.948 --> 05:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
various principles of relationships
 
05:31:11.190 --> 05:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
between numbers associative cumulative
 
05:31:12.708 --> 05:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
principles and all that
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
so um but i'm correct you're right i'm
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct that they don't need to have the
 
05:31:19.670 --> 05:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
titles of the worksheet that they're
 
05:31:22.788 --> 05:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
using no no no and you know as a teacher
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
i'd follow up and say okay what kind of
 
05:31:26.548 --> 05:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
materials can i use at home to help my
 
05:31:28.150 --> 05:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
child i'm not to help
 
05:31:29.990 --> 05:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure the teacher would say
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
anything you can do will help
 
05:31:34.150 --> 05:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
so but you're right you're right and
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
saying what you i agree
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
any further representative hall
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you um
 
05:31:42.558 --> 05:31:43.350 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you um
is

05:31:43.350 --> 05:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:31:45.350 --> 05:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
now i'm more confused than i was when we
 
05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
started is the onus on this going to be
 
05:31:47.680 --> 05:31:48.788 align:start position:0%
started is the onus on this going to be
mostly

05:31:48.788 --> 05:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
the sau the school board or whatever is
 
05:31:53.830 --> 05:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
it going to be on the individual teacher
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
is this really about the teacher
 
05:31:56.948 --> 05:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
providing the materials they're using or
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
is this really about
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
as representative
 
05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
you've got the curriculum is up online
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
your competencies are up online
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
i mean how involved are the individual
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
teachers be teachers going to be in this
 
05:32:09.840 --> 05:32:10.868 align:start position:0%
teachers be teachers going to be in this
bill

05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
is this about individual teachers or is
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
it about
 
05:32:17.350 --> 05:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
the sau is it about the school board
 
05:32:18.948 --> 05:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
even though it says school board what is
 
05:32:20.708 --> 05:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about right i i
 
05:32:23.430 --> 05:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's uh uh necessarily the
 
05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
teacher upon request um
 
05:32:30.070 --> 05:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
the school board shall have available so
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know would be in the school
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
administrative office or the district
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
office uh this material i would expect
 
05:32:37.830 --> 05:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
or or online
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought to start with but
 
05:32:40.548 --> 05:32:40.558 align:start position:0%
then it sounded like it was getting to
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
be more of a teacher thing
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
following on on what representative um
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
paul just um
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
just asked about um what what does this
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
all mean i i think looking at the
 
05:32:56.480 --> 05:32:59.190 align:start position:0%
all mean i i think looking at the
existing

05:32:59.190 --> 05:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.430 --> 05:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph roman 2
 
05:33:03.910 --> 05:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
where where a school board shall
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
establish instructional policies
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
that establish instructional goals based
 
05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
upon available information about the
 
05:33:15.030 --> 05:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge and skills pupils will need in
 
05:33:16.070 --> 05:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
the future
 
05:33:19.750 --> 05:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that that i think has has
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
has has a
 
05:33:21.120 --> 05:33:22.310 align:start position:0%
has has a
a

05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
a grounded
 
05:33:23.760 --> 05:33:25.190 align:start position:0%
a grounded
definition

05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
definition
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh because it talks about the knowledge
 
05:33:29.350 --> 05:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
and skills pupils will need in the
 
05:33:29.360 --> 05:33:30.310 align:start position:0%
and skills pupils will need in the
future

05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
future
 
05:33:33.190 --> 05:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
so so instructional goals for the
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
knowledge and skills that students would
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
need in the future but then in the
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
in the bold
 
05:33:38.798 --> 05:33:39.910 align:start position:0%
in the bold
section

05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
the instructional goals used for
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
providing students learning experiences
 
05:33:45.440 --> 05:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
providing students learning experiences
so

05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
so if we if we try to sort of tie
 
05:33:50.948 --> 05:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
that back to what the instructional
 
05:33:52.070 --> 05:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
goals are
 
05:33:53.510 --> 05:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see how the
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
the bold doesn't work for me it it sort
 
05:33:59.830 --> 05:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
of it sounds
 
05:33:59.840 --> 05:34:01.030 align:start position:0%
of it sounds
um

05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's a term we've used before
 
05:34:02.240 --> 05:34:04.390 align:start position:0%
it's a term we've used before
gobbledygook

05:34:04.390 --> 05:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
gobbledygook
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
it just sounds thank you
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
no well
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
rick i know you've been doing a lot of
 
05:34:12.948 --> 05:34:12.958 align:start position:0%
driving at a lot of late nights
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and i just had a call from the
 
05:34:17.270 --> 05:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture and i got to
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
meet with him in another half hour
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
before the trustee meeting starts up in
 
05:34:22.628 --> 05:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
another hour
 
05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
so so if there's
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
if there's potential for working on this
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
amendment i'm open to doing that so we
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
can just move on let's do that and and
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
come back to this if we can come back
 
05:34:35.510 --> 05:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
with something that you know
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
that we're all recognizing that
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think there should be some kind of a
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
a statement saying yeah parent we we
 
05:34:46.230 --> 05:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
support providing materials educational
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
goals that lead to the desired outcomes
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
or that are the outcomes
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm all for that
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
but i uh let's work on it and bring it
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
back and
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
get something
 
05:35:00.150 --> 05:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
we could sit here talking over education
 
05:35:02.310 --> 05:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
ease here for a long time
 
05:35:04.470 --> 05:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and that's where we've been in past
 
05:35:06.868 --> 05:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
years the difference between standards
 
05:35:08.788 --> 05:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
we had educational standards academic
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
standards instructional standards and
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know we tried to get it down so we
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:19.430 --> 05:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's impossible trying to follow
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
the thinking of past legislators or even
 
05:35:23.910 --> 05:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
present legislators so
 
05:35:25.990 --> 05:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman did you have to leave it
 
05:35:30.390 --> 05:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
now or three o'clock no i gotta i got to
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
have a meeting uh at least by a quarter
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
after the hour
 
05:35:36.070 --> 05:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
05:35:38.788 --> 05:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
speaker jasper or commissioner jasper
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
before i go into a meeting with this
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
speaker and other trustees at 3 30.
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
so we could try to take up another bill
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i would like to if we could so
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
maybe what we ought to do is just put
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
this one on hold we'll bring it up
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
there was a motion on the table we just
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
bring it up at the with the same motion
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
and go from there
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
and i will withdraw this amendment at
 
05:36:02.788 --> 05:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
this time
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
and so that we can bring forward another
 
05:36:05.360 --> 05:36:07.510 align:start position:0%
and so that we can bring forward another
amendment

05:36:07.510 --> 05:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendment

okay we have a motion on the table
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
representative hobson are you making the
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
motion would you like to discuss it at
 
05:36:48.480 --> 05:36:49.430 align:start position:0%
motion would you like to discuss it at
all

05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:36:53.190 --> 05:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh sure i'll discuss it at all uh
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
this information is constantly being
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
assessed whether through regional
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
planning commissions
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
projections that the school makes
 
05:37:00.958 --> 05:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
projections that the school makes
themselves

05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:37:03.670 --> 05:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
private businesses make these
 
05:37:05.590 --> 05:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
projections regularly and i believe
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
districts are already doing this
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
i think it would be good business
 
05:37:11.510 --> 05:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
practice and for this reason i am
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
putting forward the motion of otp
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
she said it represent poem
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i mean
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
i remember when i was a slackman we
 
05:37:27.190 --> 05:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
always got this information from the
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
regional planning commission so the data
 
05:37:31.350 --> 05:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
is there
 
05:37:37.510 --> 05:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why the data that
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
you have there at that time might not be
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
relevant three years down the road
 
05:37:44.240 --> 05:37:46.628 align:start position:0%
relevant three years down the road
yeah

05:37:46.628 --> 05:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.638 --> 05:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:00.980 --> 05:38:00.990 align:start position:0%
maybe i shouldn't ask these questions
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:03.670 align:start position:0%
maybe i shouldn't ask these questions
[Laughter]

05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair i believe you were instrumental
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:19.430 --> 05:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
represent porter don't they already do
 
05:38:21.280 --> 05:38:23.030 align:start position:0%
represent porter don't they already do
this

05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:38:25.430 --> 05:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
isn't this already done
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
it isn't done
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
you should not talk about the five-year
 
05:38:28.798 --> 05:38:29.990 align:start position:0%
you should not talk about the five-year
projection

05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
projection
 
05:38:31.270 --> 05:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm talking about the five-year
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
projection don't they don't they i mean
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't i remember being on the school
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
board and having people tell me we're
 
05:38:39.830 --> 05:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
looking forward to this many people in
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
the next five years or whatever
 
05:38:46.150 --> 05:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
so i think i think 1605 goes beyond that
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
every every district i think on the last
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
page of the
 
05:38:52.390 --> 05:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the school district um
 
05:38:54.788 --> 05:38:54.798 align:start position:0%
annual report has has
 
05:38:57.670 --> 05:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment projections but but to
 
05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
represent lad's question what are you
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to do with the data well the the
 
05:39:03.990 --> 05:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill answers that question on on lines
 
05:39:06.470 --> 05:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
13 and 14. i see that to hold each
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
school district's cost per student
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
growth within current annual inflation
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
rate and isn't that a school board
 
05:39:12.000 --> 05:39:13.030 align:start position:0%
rate and isn't that a school board
question

05:39:13.030 --> 05:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
and and how can the state how can we
 
05:39:17.830 --> 05:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
sitting around this table
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
predict what the what the needs of any
 
05:39:22.948 --> 05:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
specific school district are
 
05:39:25.910 --> 05:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and how in the the um
 
05:39:28.628 --> 05:39:28.638 align:start position:0%
the bill is also not specific about how
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
cost per student
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
is is calculated whether that includes
 
05:39:35.910 --> 05:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
debt service whether that includes any
 
05:39:37.270 --> 05:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
other um
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
use of reserve funds capital reserve
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
funds that might be used to replace a
 
05:39:41.600 --> 05:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
funds that might be used to replace a
roof

05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
roof
 
05:39:45.030 --> 05:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
does that then come out of curriculum uh
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
if you if you you know
 
05:39:49.110 --> 05:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
save a half million dollars to replace a
 
05:39:49.120 --> 05:39:50.070 align:start position:0%
save a half million dollars to replace a
roof

05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
roof
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
and um and your enrollment's also gone
 
05:39:55.350 --> 05:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
down by uh by one percent does that uh
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
half a million plus one percent come out
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
of curriculum teacher reductions um
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you saved that half a million
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
dollars because you knew you're going to
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
have to replace that roof
 
05:40:08.070 --> 05:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
after after 20 years but that's a local
 
05:40:09.510 --> 05:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
decision i don't see how we can be
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock thank you um i was
 
05:40:26.070 --> 05:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
looking back the notes from the hearing
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
on 1605 and it made reference to that
 
05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
same that point the point in line nine
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
to tip the way the way the calculation
 
05:40:35.510 --> 05:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
is made and secondly i wonder with the
 
05:40:35.520 --> 05:40:36.628 align:start position:0%
is made and secondly i wonder with the
cost

05:40:36.628 --> 05:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:40:36.638 --> 05:40:37.590 align:start position:0%
cost
of

05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
the school district's option
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know we have school districts in
 
05:40:44.708 --> 05:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
this state that are at the minimal level
 
05:40:46.708 --> 05:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh barely can survive the berlin the
 
05:40:48.470 --> 05:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
klamaths those folks and we have other
 
05:40:51.030 --> 05:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
places where people live who are paying
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
twenty thirty forty thousand dollars in
 
05:40:54.390 --> 05:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
some cases thirty nine thirty eight nine
 
05:40:56.788 --> 05:40:56.798 align:start position:0%
for the contribution from the schools i
 
05:40:58.070 --> 05:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be our place to
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
tell those districts that no you can't
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
you can't raise your budget over that
 
05:41:04.390 --> 05:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
one percent level so clearly if i
 
05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly
 
05:41:07.190 --> 05:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
that we can't go up over that over the
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
annual inflation rate
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
if we want to if we choose to provide
 
05:41:13.670 --> 05:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
more resources to our school
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
then we should be able to
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
is it is how you read that well i don't
 
05:41:20.470 --> 05:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
see this as capping legislation you
 
05:41:20.480 --> 05:41:22.070 align:start position:0%
see this as capping legislation you
don't

05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
but i i thought we had legislation
 
05:41:26.868 --> 05:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in law which you know there's
 
05:41:28.470 --> 05:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
a process to go through and get a
 
05:41:30.868 --> 05:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
warrant article done to cap this says
 
05:41:32.470 --> 05:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
budget reduction or consolidation
 
05:41:34.070 --> 05:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to hold
 
05:41:35.430 --> 05:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
that that sounds to me like you're
 
05:41:35.440 --> 05:41:37.270 align:start position:0%
that that sounds to me like you're
capping

05:41:37.270 --> 05:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
capping
 
05:41:39.670 --> 05:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it sounds to me like if i live in if
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
i live over in in uh tough tomorrow
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i want to have a superb resource
 
05:41:47.430 --> 05:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
commitment to my students then i should
 
05:41:48.390 --> 05:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
be able to do that if i don't mind
 
05:41:49.510 --> 05:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
paying for that
 
05:41:51.590 --> 05:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say you have to it says
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
you have a plan that's going to try to
 
05:41:53.920 --> 05:41:55.270 align:start position:0%
you have a plan that's going to try to
hold

05:41:55.270 --> 05:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
hold
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
at a certain level it doesn't say that
 
05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're bound there that you you know to
 
05:41:59.280 --> 05:42:00.390 align:start position:0%
you're bound there that you you know to
hold

05:42:00.390 --> 05:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
hold
 
05:42:02.470 --> 05:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's this is not the capping legislation
 
05:42:04.830 --> 05:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
that we have elsewhere in law
 
05:42:04.840 --> 05:42:06.548 align:start position:0%
that we have elsewhere in law
oh

05:42:06.548 --> 05:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:42:08.070 --> 05:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is something where i think we're
 
05:42:10.948 --> 05:42:10.958 align:start position:0%
trying to i i didn't write it but
 
05:42:14.548 --> 05:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
i i'm inferring that it is legislation
 
05:42:15.910 --> 05:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
05:42:18.470 --> 05:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
establish where we are going
 
05:42:20.708 --> 05:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
and what is the cost
 
05:42:22.628 --> 05:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
there their concerns we all have on that
 
05:42:24.868 --> 05:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
i think that the cost of his district in
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
my district will be very different based
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
upon debt based upon
 
05:42:29.680 --> 05:42:30.788 align:start position:0%
upon debt based upon
uh

05:42:30.788 --> 05:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:33.990 --> 05:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances maybe with cat aid
 
05:42:36.310 --> 05:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
all this is going to make and i don't
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to see comparisons between district
 
05:42:41.190 --> 05:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
or district like you know
 
05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
population is the same but how come
 
05:42:44.470 --> 05:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
yours is increasing so much for that
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
well you know there's a lot of things
 
05:42:47.830 --> 05:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
property values everything goes into the
 
05:42:50.470 --> 05:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
mix absolutely i i think this is that
 
05:42:52.310 --> 05:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
those lines are going the wrong way uh
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
rick honestly it's just that that to me
 
05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
when it says cap and hole and i see this
 
05:43:00.470 --> 05:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
and make the plan i can just see the the
 
05:43:03.110 --> 05:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
press in each town saying well one way
 
05:43:04.230 --> 05:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
or the other we're going to finally get
 
05:43:06.868 --> 05:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
this done or we're going to cut out 17
 
05:43:09.030 --> 05:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
teachers three custodians and apparel to
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
get the plan done and that goes
 
05:43:13.110 --> 05:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
depending how they want to use that as
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
it comes to warrant time and budget time
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
i just think this is i think that
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
financial part of this piece is is uh uh
 
05:43:22.230 --> 05:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
significantly uh
 
05:43:24.788 --> 05:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
impact uh school districts and and and
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
it's uh not it's not a
 
05:43:29.430 --> 05:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
val not a good way to go period
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
for that reason further further
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representatives
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up on what the chairman said
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
i see this as a transparency issue and a
 
05:43:42.948 --> 05:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
planning issue
 
05:43:45.110 --> 05:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
and the school district and the people
 
05:43:47.510 --> 05:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the school district can say cool we
 
05:43:50.070 --> 05:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
know here's the plan if we want to hold
 
05:43:50.080 --> 05:43:51.110 align:start position:0%
know here's the plan if we want to hold
this

05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
our cost per student within the
 
05:43:54.628 --> 05:43:54.638 align:start position:0%
inflation rate
 
05:43:56.788 --> 05:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
so this is the plan for that
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
but if we decide we want an auditorium
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
which is going to go over that we can
 
05:44:04.470 --> 05:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
vote for that this is just this is
 
05:44:07.270 --> 05:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
this is just to say okay what's been
 
05:44:09.910 --> 05:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
happening i mean the three-year
 
05:44:09.920 --> 05:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
happening i mean the three-year
um

05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:13.350 --> 05:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
the posting the cost per pupil of the
 
05:44:16.230 --> 05:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
previous three years is just
 
05:44:21.990 --> 05:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:24.070 --> 05:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
what's the word i want the trend thank
 
05:44:24.080 --> 05:44:25.110 align:start position:0%
what's the word i want the trend thank
you

05:44:25.110 --> 05:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:44:27.030 --> 05:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
what the trend has been where we're
 
05:44:28.628 --> 05:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
going where we're heading if we're
 
05:44:30.230 --> 05:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
seeing that oh
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
every year we lose four percent of
 
05:44:33.910 --> 05:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
students four percent of students four
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
percent of students at what point does
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
it make sense to cut a bus to cut a
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
teacher at what point does it make sense
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
to cut a school
 
05:44:46.070 --> 05:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know because a lot of
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
towns ours included built a whole bunch
 
05:44:51.750 --> 05:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
of stu schools as we had student growth
 
05:44:54.230 --> 05:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's just planning it's just looking at
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
it it's not saying we have to hold them
 
05:44:59.430 --> 05:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
it says let's make a plan
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
so that if we need to we can
 
05:45:04.948 --> 05:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
unless we decide to do otherwise it's
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.470 --> 05:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
this to me is transparency to the
 
05:45:15.910 --> 05:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers number one and number two
 
05:45:19.190 --> 05:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
helping the school district plan for the
 
05:45:22.310 --> 05:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
future by taking a look at what are the
 
05:45:25.430 --> 05:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
trends what's been happening and what
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
if we want to hold our costs down what
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
can we do what are our options
 
05:45:36.070 --> 05:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
right what are our options we can vote
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
not to do that but what are our options
 
05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:45.110 --> 05:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative tanner
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um i've served on the school
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
budget committee at centipede for a
 
05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
number of years now
 
05:45:51.040 --> 05:45:52.070 align:start position:0%
number of years now
and

05:45:52.070 --> 05:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's where the transparency is i mean
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
we we have open meetings we discuss
 
05:46:00.070 --> 05:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
every little bit of the budget in fact
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know when i first moved to new
 
05:46:03.670 --> 05:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i wasn't
 
05:46:05.990 --> 05:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
i wasn't familiar with the school town
 
05:46:06.000 --> 05:46:06.948 align:start position:0%
i wasn't familiar with the school town
meeting

05:46:06.948 --> 05:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:46:08.948 --> 05:46:08.958 align:start position:0%
thing of new hampshire
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
i was blown away
 
05:46:12.628 --> 05:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
the first school meeting i went after i
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
was hired as a teacher
 
05:46:17.350 --> 05:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
they were discussing toilet paper
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
what kind of toilet paper they were
 
05:46:20.788 --> 05:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
going to use in the schools and how much
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost i i
 
05:46:24.868 --> 05:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
had never been at that level of
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
transparency before and probably never
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
want to be again but
 
05:46:29.120 --> 05:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
want to be again but
that's

05:46:30.150 --> 05:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
school when you're on the budget
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
committee you do and you take into
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
consideration how many students you have
 
05:46:37.040 --> 05:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
consideration how many students you have
this

05:46:37.910 --> 05:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
for me
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
is um again kind of a big brother issue
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's taking things that should happen at
 
05:46:47.910 --> 05:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
our local school district levels
 
05:46:49.750 --> 05:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
if if
 
05:46:52.390 --> 05:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know schools have the budget
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
committees they've got a budget process
 
05:46:57.030 --> 05:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's an election process there's a
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article process there's all
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of processes for people to look at
 
05:47:04.470 --> 05:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
the money and to find out
 
05:47:06.470 --> 05:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know where every dollar is being
 
05:47:08.788 --> 05:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
spent and i just think this is
 
05:47:11.750 --> 05:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
overkill and it's overkill unnecessary
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
and i think it does
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
put a cap
 
05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
on budgets this stuff is being done
 
05:47:19.430 --> 05:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
and and representative tanner is
 
05:47:21.430 --> 05:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct the whether you have
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
a budget committee or a budget advisory
 
05:47:25.350 --> 05:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
committee working with your your
 
05:47:27.910 --> 05:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent administration i would
 
05:47:29.590 --> 05:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
never go out and say well i'm just going
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
to go out by another 66 passenger
 
05:47:33.830 --> 05:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
elementary school bus without knowing
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
where the projections are
 
05:47:37.430 --> 05:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
down the road and
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
in what my indebtedness is going to look
 
05:47:39.680 --> 05:47:41.430 align:start position:0%
in what my indebtedness is going to look
like

05:47:41.430 --> 05:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:47:43.270 --> 05:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
we do it with our school building aid
 
05:47:44.788 --> 05:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
too you're not going to get any school
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
building aid in the state and remember
 
05:47:48.470 --> 05:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement plan we just put
 
05:47:52.150 --> 05:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
together where we have to identify um
 
05:47:55.750 --> 05:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
all these issues of demographics of
 
05:47:57.910 --> 05:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
capacity space we're using how we're
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
maintaining all that is part of the plan
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
so to infer somehow that we're not doing
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
this we're just handing out a budget
 
05:48:06.708 --> 05:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
this given year and next year we'll do
 
05:48:08.548 --> 05:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
the same thing they're all linked i
 
05:48:10.470 --> 05:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
asked our our superintendent
 
05:48:11.990 --> 05:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
several nights ago at a school board
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
meeting where are our demographics and
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
laura was eight lori was able to give me
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
an outline where we come and where we're
 
05:48:22.070 --> 05:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
going and that projection data is there
 
05:48:23.590 --> 05:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you walk into the
 
05:48:25.110 --> 05:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent's office and ask for it
 
05:48:26.390 --> 05:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
you'll get it
 
05:48:29.190 --> 05:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
and because i i it's one of those basic
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
things that's uh part of uh education
 
05:48:32.240 --> 05:48:33.670 align:start position:0%
things that's uh part of uh education
finance

05:48:33.670 --> 05:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
finance
 
05:48:33.680 --> 05:48:35.110 align:start position:0%
finance
so

05:48:35.110 --> 05:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:48:36.548 --> 05:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
and it's available
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's available yes representatives you
 
05:48:41.350 --> 05:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
have me totally confused
 
05:48:41.360 --> 05:48:42.390 align:start position:0%
have me totally confused
um

05:48:42.390 --> 05:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the big brother thing has me totally
 
05:48:46.548 --> 05:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
confused too it says the school
 
05:48:48.708 --> 05:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
administrative unit shall prepare it for
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
05:48:52.470 --> 05:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
i don't understand a how that's big
 
05:48:55.030 --> 05:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
brother b how that's telling anybody how
 
05:48:56.948 --> 05:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
to spend their money
 
05:48:58.868 --> 05:48:58.878 align:start position:0%
etc i mean it's just the school
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
administrative unit and partly
 
05:49:01.840 --> 05:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
administrative unit and partly
yeah

05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:49:05.670 --> 05:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
that could be helped by or done by the
 
05:49:08.070 --> 05:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
budget committee or whatever it is
 
05:49:10.150 --> 05:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
however your school is set up and it's
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
different in different towns how that's
 
05:49:12.480 --> 05:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
different in different towns how that's
done

05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
but also because this administrative
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
unit part of the plan part is i remember
 
05:49:21.350 --> 05:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
our budget committee out of the la at
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
our last school district meeting had
 
05:49:25.430 --> 05:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
planned big cuts and they just said
 
05:49:27.590 --> 05:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
across the board cuts
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
and it was up to the school district to
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
decide how they wanted to cut them while
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
they put those back in and we'll see how
 
05:49:34.470 --> 05:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
the vote goes but
 
05:49:34.480 --> 05:49:37.110 align:start position:0%
the vote goes but
um

05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
but it seems like the school
 
05:49:41.350 --> 05:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
administrative unit as a whole is going
 
05:49:42.868 --> 05:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
to be the one that's going to be better
 
05:49:46.230 --> 05:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
able to make those plans to say you know
 
05:49:49.030 --> 05:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
we can probably do this but we don't
 
05:49:51.510 --> 05:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
really want to do that
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
so that seems reasonable for them to be
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
the one presenting the plan
 
05:49:55.680 --> 05:49:56.788 align:start position:0%
the one presenting the plan
and

05:49:56.788 --> 05:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know i don't understand this is just
 
05:50:01.350 --> 05:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
a a local within the school
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
administrative unit for the school board
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying communication needs to
 
05:50:05.760 --> 05:50:07.750 align:start position:0%
it's it's saying communication needs to
happen

05:50:07.750 --> 05:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:50:09.910 --> 05:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
communication with the governance of
 
05:50:11.830 --> 05:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
that particular unit
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:50:15.190 --> 05:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
yeah this the school board and the
 
05:50:15.200 --> 05:50:16.628 align:start position:0%
yeah this the school board and the
administration

05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
you have the legislature out here which
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
is the body that elects the
 
05:50:25.270 --> 05:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
governance or the school board and
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
internally now we're getting down in the
 
05:50:30.470 --> 05:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
internal workings of how local
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
districts are administered and operate
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that that is
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
again we're getting into the
 
05:50:37.680 --> 05:50:39.190 align:start position:0%
again we're getting into the
micromanagement

05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%

05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%

05:55:51.670 --> 05:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
and the amendment simply puts the
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
language in a different section of law
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
where we thought it fit better that's
 
05:56:22.708 --> 05:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:22.718 --> 05:56:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:56:26.150 --> 05:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay so does everybody have a copy of
 
05:56:28.638 --> 05:56:29.990 align:start position:0%
okay so does everybody have a copy of
that

05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:56:32.628 --> 05:56:32.638 align:start position:0%
sir any further discussion on this
 
05:56:34.310 --> 05:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendment we've heard representative
 
05:56:37.510 --> 05:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
porter indicate that
 
05:56:40.390 --> 05:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
the bold is the same but in a different
 
05:56:41.830 --> 05:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
area of statute is that what you're
 
05:56:41.840 --> 05:56:51.590 align:start position:0%
area of statute is that what you're
saying

05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
the effect of the language is the same
 
05:57:02.470 --> 05:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:04.310 --> 05:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay represent you
 
05:57:04.320 --> 05:57:05.110 align:start position:0%
okay represent you
yeah

05:57:05.110 --> 05:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:57:05.120 --> 05:57:06.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:07.670 --> 05:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a
 
05:57:10.708 --> 05:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
problem with the amendment in that um
 
05:57:10.718 --> 05:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
problem with the amendment in that um
it

05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:57:13.990 --> 05:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
changes the title
 
05:57:17.190 --> 05:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
um it changes the location in statute
 
05:57:20.708 --> 05:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
and has a different content
 
05:57:20.718 --> 05:57:22.948 align:start position:0%
and has a different content
i

05:57:22.948 --> 05:57:22.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:57:30.150 --> 05:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh just take this thing one
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
step further so we don't have to go
 
05:57:36.868 --> 05:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
through that process um
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
is there a motion because we have no
 
05:57:42.390 --> 05:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
motion on the table right now uh from uh
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli yes i vote itl
 
05:57:48.628 --> 05:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
and represent hobson
 
05:57:51.150 --> 05:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the table to itl
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
1113 made by represent cordelli and
 
05:57:55.990 --> 05:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
second by reps the hops and represent
 
05:57:56.000 --> 05:57:57.110 align:start position:0%
second by reps the hops and represent
cordeli

05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
cordeli
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak to your
 
05:57:58.798 --> 05:58:00.788 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak to your
motion

05:58:00.788 --> 05:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:58:02.708 --> 05:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:58:06.230 --> 05:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
deep bill
 
05:58:08.638 --> 05:58:10.548 align:start position:0%
deep bill
goes

05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
goes
 
05:58:13.830 --> 05:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
too far in in terms of uh remote
 
05:58:13.840 --> 05:58:14.948 align:start position:0%
too far in in terms of uh remote
learning

05:58:14.948 --> 05:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
learning
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
i think it contradicts
 
05:58:19.030 --> 05:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
and undermines uh
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
rules that were just uh put in place uh
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
last week i believe
 
05:58:27.110 --> 05:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
um with the state board um
 
05:58:30.150 --> 05:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i will um make my
 
05:58:30.160 --> 05:58:32.548 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons i will um make my
motion

05:58:32.548 --> 05:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
further discussion reps on boom yeah
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
just add on i mean remote the learning
 
05:58:40.390 --> 05:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
was done because of an emergency so i
 
05:58:41.990 --> 05:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be something that
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
we can do it all the time thank you
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:58:50.150 --> 05:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank you very much mr chair so
 
05:58:52.470 --> 05:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
how does this work when it comes to um
 
05:58:52.480 --> 05:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
how does this work when it comes to um
velox

05:59:04.470 --> 05:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
throw it out there
 
05:59:05.760 --> 05:59:06.470 align:start position:0%
throw it out there
i'm

05:59:06.470 --> 05:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:59:08.390 --> 05:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'm familiar with that you know vlax
 
05:59:10.150 --> 05:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
course virtual learning academy a
 
05:59:11.350 --> 05:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
05:59:11.360 --> 05:59:12.230 align:start position:0%
charter school
um

05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:14.470 --> 05:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
so that's all remote right it's all
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
remote but it is chartered as an online
 
05:59:17.360 --> 05:59:18.868 align:start position:0%
remote but it is chartered as an online
school

05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
so that it would you know there would
 
05:59:23.110 --> 05:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
technically they wouldn't have any days
 
05:59:25.910 --> 05:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
off they could just do it at home and
 
05:59:28.070 --> 05:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
then they send it in and get approval
 
05:59:31.830 --> 05:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
from the velax or they'd get zero days
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
because charter schools also have a um
 
05:59:38.310 --> 05:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:44.230 --> 05:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'd have to look at i'm not up on speed
 
05:59:49.030 --> 05:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
on felix
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:01.590 --> 06:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:04.948 --> 06:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
yes reps to hobson
 
06:00:07.430 --> 06:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is just my perspective
 
06:00:07.440 --> 06:00:08.708 align:start position:0%
this is this is just my perspective
um

06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:11.430 --> 06:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the testimony we were
 
06:00:11.440 --> 06:00:12.868 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the testimony we were
presented

06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
presented
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:19.590 --> 06:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
the results for remote versus in person
 
06:00:19.600 --> 06:00:20.390 align:start position:0%
the results for remote versus in person
were

06:00:20.390 --> 06:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:00:23.190 --> 06:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
were much different um and and as far as
 
06:00:24.788 --> 06:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
vlax goes
 
06:00:24.798 --> 06:00:26.070 align:start position:0%
vlax goes
vlax

06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
vlax
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is their business they've created
 
06:00:29.750 --> 06:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
their craft they've perfected their
 
06:00:32.548 --> 06:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
craft with remote instruction i don't
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
know that
 
06:00:34.000 --> 06:00:34.868 align:start position:0%
know that
um

06:00:34.868 --> 06:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:37.590 --> 06:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
regular in-person school is at that
 
06:00:38.788 --> 06:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
level yet
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's just my my opinion
 
06:00:44.390 --> 06:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
mr chair or women represent porter did
 
06:00:46.150 --> 06:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
have her hand up i'd really like to
 
06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
speak to my bill and to my amendment um
 
06:00:51.270 --> 06:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
this bill was originally brought forward
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
when we were still having
 
06:00:55.110 --> 06:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
surges of covid
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
in schools and at that time
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
it was an option
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
for schools to be able to go remote for
 
06:01:04.390 --> 06:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
a day or two
 
06:01:05.990 --> 06:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
so that they could keep
 
06:01:08.310 --> 06:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
so that the kids could be safe the staff
 
06:01:09.590 --> 06:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
could be safe
 
06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
and there they could maintain the number
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
of people they needed in the building to
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
run effectively so if there were too
 
06:01:17.430 --> 06:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
many staff members out
 
06:01:19.670 --> 06:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
they would close the building for safety
 
06:01:19.680 --> 06:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
they would close the building for safety
sake

06:01:21.670 --> 06:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
sake
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
then the rule came down that they could
 
06:01:26.230 --> 06:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
not do that anymore
 
06:01:28.788 --> 06:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
and the reason given was
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
to talk about remote learning over long
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
periods of time being detrimental to the
 
06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
learning of students
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
which was
 
06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
which was testimony that was given but
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
it missed the point of the bill the
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
point of the bill was to allow the
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
school districts to be nimble and turn
 
06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
on a dime when they needed to for a day
 
06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
or two so that they could keep the
 
06:01:58.230 --> 06:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
safety of the children in line
 
06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education has says
 
06:02:02.788 --> 06:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
they can use remote learning if it's a
 
06:02:04.628 --> 06:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
snow day
 
06:02:07.030 --> 06:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
but they can't use remote learning if
 
06:02:10.230 --> 06:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the staff is out if
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
three-quarters of the staff is out they
 
06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
still have to meet
 
06:02:15.830 --> 06:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
or they close the school and make it up
 
06:02:17.590 --> 06:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
and if you've been in a classroom you
 
06:02:21.670 --> 06:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
know it's better to continue the
 
06:02:21.680 --> 06:02:23.030 align:start position:0%
know it's better to continue the
instruction

06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
day after day
 
06:02:27.030 --> 06:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that and not have a gap if
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
you can do it because what happens at
 
06:02:31.430 --> 06:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the year is usually not very
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the learning of the
 
06:02:32.878 --> 06:02:33.830 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the learning of the
children

06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
so this bill was brought forward so that
 
06:02:37.510 --> 06:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
schools could
 
06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
when they need to
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
close and go remote for a day or two
 
06:02:45.910 --> 06:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that things were safe
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i think the testimony that was
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
brought forth about months of remote
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
learning damaging children was missing
 
06:02:56.070 --> 06:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill
 
06:02:58.070 --> 06:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why we changed with the
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
amendment we put it in
 
06:03:02.230 --> 06:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
to the section that dealt with
 
06:03:04.150 --> 06:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
the number of school days
 
06:03:06.708 --> 06:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
and hours that needed to be met for the
 
06:03:10.150 --> 06:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
school so as much as i respect your all
 
06:03:12.788 --> 06:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
your opinions the point of the bill was
 
06:03:15.670 --> 06:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
to allow districts to stay safe and
 
06:03:18.150 --> 06:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
nimble and do what was best for them
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
when they needed to and now that has
 
06:03:23.510 --> 06:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
been taken away by a rule
 
06:03:23.520 --> 06:03:25.830 align:start position:0%
been taken away by a rule
but

06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.708 --> 06:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
legislation trumps rules
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
if god bless us we're hoping it doesn't
 
06:03:31.840 --> 06:03:32.948 align:start position:0%
if god bless us we're hoping it doesn't
happen

06:03:32.948 --> 06:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
happen
 
06:03:35.030 --> 06:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
but if three months from now we have
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
another major surge of covet
 
06:03:39.830 --> 06:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
and schools have to
 
06:03:41.430 --> 06:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
close down
 
06:03:43.350 --> 06:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to be going to school in
 
06:03:44.708 --> 06:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
the summer time
 
06:03:46.230 --> 06:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
how are they going to make up all those
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
days and the department the
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
department said oh well they can just
 
06:03:53.190 --> 06:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
ask to have those days waived
 
06:03:53.200 --> 06:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
ask to have those days waived
well

06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:03:56.390 --> 06:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
have the days waived wouldn't it be
 
06:03:58.628 --> 06:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
better to meet for a day or two
 
06:04:01.430 --> 06:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
remotely than to give it up all together
 
06:04:04.390 --> 06:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why this bill is forward vote
 
06:04:06.310 --> 06:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
your conscience
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh for you represent porter is this
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
contingent upon with approval of the
 
06:04:13.840 --> 06:04:17.350 align:start position:0%
contingent upon with approval of the
commissioner

06:04:17.350 --> 06:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:19.750 --> 06:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
no it's not
 
06:04:21.830 --> 06:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
represented waltz
 
06:04:21.840 --> 06:04:22.948 align:start position:0%
represented waltz
cute

06:04:22.948 --> 06:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
cute
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know i look at this as one of those
 
06:04:27.110 --> 06:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
things when the rules are promulgated
 
06:04:28.830 --> 06:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's a set of rules with unintended
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
consequences and you know
 
06:04:33.670 --> 06:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
we all know that everybody hated how
 
06:04:35.990 --> 06:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
many how many days there was remote
 
06:04:38.230 --> 06:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
education i think everybody out there
 
06:04:40.070 --> 06:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
understands remote education is a bad
 
06:04:40.080 --> 06:04:40.948 align:start position:0%
understands remote education is a bad
choice

06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
choice
 
06:04:42.150 --> 06:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to put out there that
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
there are other emergencies that we
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
can't see coming and you know i was
 
06:04:47.830 --> 06:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
watching the news this morning and they
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that russia's got
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
the nuclear bomb and there's serious
 
06:04:53.190 --> 06:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
concern that they may use it in this
 
06:04:55.510 --> 06:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
ukraine conflict so if they blow up a
 
06:04:57.510 --> 06:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear bomb and we need to keep some of
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
our kids indoors for a month or
 
06:05:01.190 --> 06:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
something because it's dangerous to let
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
them out of the house
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
they can't go to school so long as that
 
06:05:06.070 --> 06:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
rule stays in place
 
06:05:08.390 --> 06:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
so i think by passing something like one
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
of these bills
 
06:05:12.230 --> 06:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
it takes away that rule that was really
 
06:05:12.240 --> 06:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
it takes away that rule that was really
vindictive

06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
vindictive
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and let's look at something that
 
06:05:17.830 --> 06:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
gives educators the flexibility they
 
06:05:20.390 --> 06:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
need for those things we can't even see
 
06:05:20.400 --> 06:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
need for those things we can't even see
coming

06:05:21.270 --> 06:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
coming
 
06:05:23.830 --> 06:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
and to leave that kind of rule in place
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
when there could be emergencies out
 
06:05:27.510 --> 06:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
there that we can't even see coming i
 
06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
think is really short-sighted and
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
ideological and i would recommend that
 
06:05:33.750 --> 06:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
we pass one or the other versions of
 
06:05:36.070 --> 06:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we give the educators
 
06:05:38.548 --> 06:05:38.558 align:start position:0%
the flexibility they need frankly i am
 
06:05:40.310 --> 06:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
not at all worried about educators
 
06:05:42.470 --> 06:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
trying to go to remote more than they
 
06:05:45.590 --> 06:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
should because the teachers the kids the
 
06:05:48.628 --> 06:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
administrators everybody hates it and
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to only use it if they
 
06:05:52.708 --> 06:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to but there are things
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
out there there are emergencies out
 
06:05:56.628 --> 06:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
there that we can't even imagine and i
 
06:05:58.230 --> 06:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
think we should let the educators have
 
06:05:59.830 --> 06:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
the flexibility they need to address
 
06:05:59.840 --> 06:06:01.830 align:start position:0%
the flexibility they need to address
them

06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:06:03.270 --> 06:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
06:06:04.868 --> 06:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think what's
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
happening now we have rules that can
 
06:06:10.470 --> 06:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
change and i think by putting it in law
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
like this
 
06:06:13.830 --> 06:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
schools can just say hey we're just
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
going to go remote no matter what
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
so rather than a law let's do it what
 
06:06:20.470 --> 06:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing now
 
06:06:20.480 --> 06:06:21.510 align:start position:0%
we're doing now
so

06:06:21.510 --> 06:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
if something happened just like the rule
 
06:06:27.270 --> 06:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
just came out you don't can't do remote
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
if we have another emergency
 
06:06:31.830 --> 06:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
it can be an emergency and the rules
 
06:06:34.310 --> 06:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
would change or the government declares
 
06:06:36.628 --> 06:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
an emergency then we can do remote by
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
putting in a law it just says
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
they can do it whenever they want and
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's not what we should do thank you
 
06:06:46.470 --> 06:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i addressed it mr chairman just go
 
06:06:47.990 --> 06:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
ahead i don't think you could do rule
 
06:06:49.750 --> 06:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
making fast enough in the case of a real
 
06:06:51.910 --> 06:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
emergency like the one i described i
 
06:06:54.070 --> 06:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
think we ought to leave local control
 
06:06:55.350 --> 06:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
leave it in the hands of the
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
administrators who are going to have to
 
06:07:03.190 --> 06:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
who's handsome tanner
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
um i haven't talked to a teacher yet
 
06:07:14.548 --> 06:07:14.558 align:start position:0%
who thought remote was a good idea
 
06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
i haven't talked to an administrator or
 
06:07:19.430 --> 06:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
a superintendent who said oh yeah i
 
06:07:22.310 --> 06:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
think next week we'll just go remote
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
just for the heck of it
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
those people that went remote and had to
 
06:07:28.230 --> 06:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
go remote
 
06:07:31.830 --> 06:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
were working 8 9 10 11 hours because
 
06:07:33.190 --> 06:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
some parents
 
06:07:35.190 --> 06:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know had to work
 
06:07:35.200 --> 06:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
you know had to work
and

06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
and their kids were at home and
 
06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
they ended up working on their their
 
06:07:42.708 --> 06:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
assignments in the evening and they
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
would call the teacher
 
06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
and the teacher had to provide remote
 
06:07:46.320 --> 06:07:48.390 align:start position:0%
and the teacher had to provide remote
instruction

06:07:48.390 --> 06:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
after after normal school hours
 
06:07:53.510 --> 06:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
we also know because of
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
blizzard bags i don't know if all of you
 
06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
are aware of blizzard bags but
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
one year when we had an exceptional
 
06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
amount of snow days
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
our school decided
 
06:08:07.110 --> 06:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
that they would set up a program called
 
06:08:08.628 --> 06:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
blizzard bags
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
and in those bags were
 
06:08:12.628 --> 06:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
each teacher was to make up three
 
06:08:16.070 --> 06:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
blizzard bags with activities and
 
06:08:18.230 --> 06:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
studies for students to do and good
 
06:08:20.470 --> 06:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
instructions for their parents and
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
some fun things and
 
06:08:24.788 --> 06:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
they took them home
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
and when a snow day was called
 
06:08:29.270 --> 06:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
if a certain percentage i think it was
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
like if 80 percent of the class
 
06:08:33.350 --> 06:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
brought in the work from the blizzard
 
06:08:33.360 --> 06:08:34.390 align:start position:0%
brought in the work from the blizzard
bag

06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
bag
 
06:08:36.628 --> 06:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
the school would get
 
06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
credit for that day of school
 
06:08:41.910 --> 06:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
and the rationale behind it is as
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
everybody else is kind of chimed in
 
06:08:47.670 --> 06:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
is that continuity is great is is
 
06:08:50.470 --> 06:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
really important and we know one of the
 
06:08:52.470 --> 06:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
things with remote was
 
06:08:54.548 --> 06:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
the loss of connection
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
and also the loss of continuity
 
06:08:59.750 --> 06:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
and if there's an opportunity
 
06:09:01.590 --> 06:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:09:04.390 --> 06:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
scrub down a place just like we had here
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
although they didn't thoroughly scrub
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the place but
 
06:09:07.440 --> 06:09:08.230 align:start position:0%
the place but
if

06:09:08.230 --> 06:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:09:08.240 --> 06:09:09.510 align:start position:0%
if
if

06:09:09.510 --> 06:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:09:12.470 --> 06:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
the school has to has to go out
 
06:09:14.470 --> 06:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
and and we had situations where we had
 
06:09:17.350 --> 06:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
influenza outbreaks where we had up to
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
40 of our student body not show up
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
because they were sick
 
06:09:24.948 --> 06:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
they called school for a long weekend so
 
06:09:26.948 --> 06:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
that they could get in and really do an
 
06:09:28.868 --> 06:09:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh disinfectant
 
06:09:30.470 --> 06:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
in the school
 
06:09:32.548 --> 06:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
that was before we had remote
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
and it was uh
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
it broke up the school i mean broke up
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
the school year and and whatever class
 
06:09:40.070 --> 06:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
you were teaching you now had another
 
06:09:40.080 --> 06:09:41.190 align:start position:0%
you were teaching you now had another
day

06:09:41.190 --> 06:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
day
 
06:09:43.990 --> 06:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i think um
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
you know i think it was
 
06:09:48.788 --> 06:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
not i think you used the word vindict i
 
06:09:50.470 --> 06:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't think it was vindictive as much as
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
it was a knee-jerk reaction to
 
06:09:54.628 --> 06:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
these schools aren't going back to
 
06:09:56.868 --> 06:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
school fast enough for
 
06:09:59.430 --> 06:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people and so they must be
 
06:10:01.430 --> 06:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
doing it on purpose well
 
06:10:03.670 --> 06:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think schools did it on purpose
 
06:10:03.680 --> 06:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
i don't think schools did it on purpose
and

06:10:04.470 --> 06:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
i would strongly support
 
06:10:08.230 --> 06:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
the action on this to give a clear
 
06:10:08.240 --> 06:10:09.430 align:start position:0%
the action on this to give a clear
message

06:10:09.430 --> 06:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
message
 
06:10:12.150 --> 06:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
that um it's not on purpose and it and
 
06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
it needs to be
 
06:10:14.160 --> 06:10:15.190 align:start position:0%
it needs to be
keep

06:10:15.190 --> 06:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
keep
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
for the local control to make the
 
06:10:19.190 --> 06:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
decisions when needed
 
06:10:20.708 --> 06:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to allow for a couple
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
more and then i'm i'm going to have to
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
close or you know either take some
 
06:10:24.868 --> 06:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
action or we're just going to have to
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
delay this thing because i got to get
 
06:10:27.510 --> 06:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
out of here
 
06:10:29.190 --> 06:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
um represent would talk
 
06:10:30.788 --> 06:10:30.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad i'll keep it
 
06:10:30.798 --> 06:10:32.150 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad i'll keep it
brief

06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
brief
 
06:10:35.590 --> 06:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
this is no more this this bill is so
 
06:10:38.708 --> 06:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
important to local control we heard all
 
06:10:40.868 --> 06:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
during all during the last year by the
 
06:10:42.788 --> 06:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
governor and the commissioner let the
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
local community decide they know how the
 
06:10:46.470 --> 06:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
school they know the situation
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
all the way through local local let them
 
06:10:50.390 --> 06:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
do it now all of a sudden boom you come
 
06:10:52.868 --> 06:10:52.878 align:start position:0%
back with nope let's just make it cast
 
06:10:55.990 --> 06:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
in stone that that makes no sense to me
 
06:10:58.150 --> 06:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh everyone here in this room knows how
 
06:11:00.548 --> 06:11:00.558 align:start position:0%
how horrible remote was for the amount
 
06:11:02.390 --> 06:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
of period time but we don't know how
 
06:11:04.070 --> 06:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
horrible it is if we have three days in
 
06:11:05.990 --> 06:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
a row where the high school roof
 
06:11:06.000 --> 06:11:07.350 align:start position:0%
a row where the high school roof
collapses

06:11:07.350 --> 06:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
collapses
 
06:11:07.360 --> 06:11:25.270 align:start position:0%
collapses
or

06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:27.030 --> 06:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
come in thank you come the end of the
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
year well we're not going to count those
 
06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
three days that's a budget issue because
 
06:11:31.670 --> 06:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
the staff's not going to be paid three
 
06:11:32.788 --> 06:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
more days and they're not going to be
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
money there
 
06:11:35.990 --> 06:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is clearly a local educational
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
option how you teach what you teach when
 
06:11:40.788 --> 06:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
you teach that's what this is we heard
 
06:11:42.390 --> 06:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
that all year long from the governor all
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
year long for the commissioner and all
 
06:11:47.350 --> 06:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
of a sudden boom oh no we can't do it
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
leave it where it should be
 
06:11:51.590 --> 06:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cordelia
 
06:11:52.470 --> 06:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:11:52.480 --> 06:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:56.830 --> 06:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
distance education may be offered
 
06:11:59.830 --> 06:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
only due to the snow day as was
 
06:12:02.070 --> 06:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
discussed number two is an option for a
 
06:12:04.230 --> 06:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
parent or guardian making a request for
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
distance education
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
so if there's an outbreak let's say in a
 
06:12:08.160 --> 06:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
so if there's an outbreak let's say in a
classroom

06:12:09.910 --> 06:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
a parent could go to the school board
 
06:12:13.590 --> 06:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
and said i want my
 
06:12:15.910 --> 06:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
child out i want them to do remote
 
06:12:15.920 --> 06:12:16.948 align:start position:0%
child out i want them to do remote
that's

06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:12:20.150 --> 06:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
in the in the rules now um i think the
 
06:12:20.160 --> 06:12:21.030 align:start position:0%
in the in the rules now um i think the
concern

06:12:21.030 --> 06:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
concern
 
06:12:22.708 --> 06:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry wait a minute please let me
 
06:12:22.718 --> 06:12:24.230 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry wait a minute please let me
finish

06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
finish
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
um the concern um that was discussed i i
 
06:12:30.150 --> 06:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
imagine within the department and
 
06:12:32.788 --> 06:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
certainly within the board was what has
 
06:12:35.110 --> 06:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
happened in terms of uh remote
 
06:12:38.708 --> 06:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
instruction and the uh loss of learning
 
06:12:41.670 --> 06:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
that we saw and the nation saw
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
06:12:44.948 --> 06:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
in statute with
 
06:12:44.958 --> 06:12:46.708 align:start position:0%
in statute with
esser

06:12:46.708 --> 06:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
esser
 
06:12:49.590 --> 06:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
the ability 20 percent of sr-3 was
 
06:12:50.708 --> 06:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
06:12:53.750 --> 06:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
directed to recovery of learning loss
 
06:12:56.070 --> 06:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know i i want to look at that to see
 
06:12:57.990 --> 06:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
how much is actually taking place in
 
06:13:00.150 --> 06:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
that regard i don't think much
 
06:13:00.160 --> 06:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
that regard i don't think much
but

06:13:01.910 --> 06:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:13:03.910 --> 06:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
there have been estimates of half a year
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
of math
 
06:13:08.868 --> 06:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
learning loss um in the state i believe
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
the learning proficiency in math dropped
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
from 48 to 38 percent i think that this
 
06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to say that we are going
 
06:13:20.948 --> 06:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
to focus on in-person instruction and
 
06:13:23.110 --> 06:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
that is what matters but provide an
 
06:13:26.548 --> 06:13:26.558 align:start position:0%
option um for parents to go remote if
 
06:13:33.350 --> 06:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:34.470 --> 06:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
just to follow up to represent
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
cordelia's piece i understand what
 
06:13:38.470 --> 06:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying glenn no one likes remote
 
06:13:39.750 --> 06:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
no one thought it was valid i understand
 
06:13:42.150 --> 06:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
that but the parents going to the school
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
board to say we want kids up that
 
06:13:45.990 --> 06:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't cut it that's way too long a
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
distance there's two three four five
 
06:13:49.670 --> 06:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
these superintendents have to make
 
06:13:51.830 --> 06:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
decisions based on what happens then
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of a
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
thousand kids in the school period if
 
06:13:56.230 --> 06:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
one youngster parent doesn't want to
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
send the kid to school they don't send
 
06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
them to school
 
06:14:00.310 --> 06:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the school system
 
06:14:02.230 --> 06:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
have a chance to keep up with what's
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
happening in their community the
 
06:14:05.910 --> 06:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner can't do it the governor
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
can't do it because they're not there
 
06:14:08.868 --> 06:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
that's why you have a local school board
 
06:14:11.990 --> 06:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
a local superintendent this is local
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
representing moffat
 
06:14:18.628 --> 06:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you miss chair the the reason that
 
06:14:20.868 --> 06:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
this rule came about with regard to
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
remote learning is because of what's
 
06:14:25.190 --> 06:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
happened in many places like nashua
 
06:14:27.990 --> 06:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
nashua shut their doors for a year
 
06:14:30.948 --> 06:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
sorry nashua shut their doors for a year
 
06:14:33.590 --> 06:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that you wonder why a lot of folks
 
06:14:36.548 --> 06:14:36.558 align:start position:0%
on that way want efas it's because the
 
06:14:38.708 --> 06:14:38.718 align:start position:0%
the remote option
 
06:14:41.110 --> 06:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the view of many was abused so that's
 
06:14:42.548 --> 06:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
where that rule came about i hear you
 
06:14:44.310 --> 06:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
about i agree with you about local
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
control but just you understand look at
 
06:14:48.230 --> 06:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
nashua and then try to understand how
 
06:14:52.628 --> 06:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:55.190 --> 06:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
06:14:55.200 --> 06:14:57.030 align:start position:0%
mr chair
yes

06:14:57.030 --> 06:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:14:59.350 --> 06:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at the amendment that i gave
 
06:15:00.868 --> 06:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
it deals with
 
06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
180 days of instruction
 
06:15:07.830 --> 06:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
it deals with emergency situations
 
06:15:11.030 --> 06:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the amendment came forward
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is not talking about closing
 
06:15:16.868 --> 06:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
the schools down for a year unless god
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
forbid we have a nuclear war and it has
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
06:15:22.390 --> 06:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is talking about
 
06:15:24.230 --> 06:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
two or three days they need to close
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
down to make sure that the school is
 
06:15:28.708 --> 06:15:28.718 align:start position:0%
safe the students are safe the staff is
 
06:15:28.718 --> 06:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
safe the students are safe the staff is
safe

06:15:31.110 --> 06:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
06:15:39.270 --> 06:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to respond and i didn't
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
say i don't see anything that says two
 
06:15:43.750 --> 06:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
or three days it just says 180 days so
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
nashua could use this and do remote 180
 
06:15:50.788 --> 06:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
rep samoan i i just want to say
 
06:15:56.548 --> 06:15:56.558 align:start position:0%
something before we close this hearing
 
06:15:56.558 --> 06:15:57.430 align:start position:0%
something before we close this hearing
you

06:15:57.430 --> 06:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:15:59.030 --> 06:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard it said over and over and
 
06:16:01.750 --> 06:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
over again public school teachers do not
 
06:16:03.910 --> 06:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
want to be out of the classroom they
 
06:16:07.110 --> 06:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
want to be in their classrooms it is a
 
06:16:10.470 --> 06:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
much more manageable and fulfilling job
 
06:16:13.750 --> 06:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
to be in the room with your students on
 
06:16:15.430 --> 06:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
a daily basis
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
we can't go back and redo the history of
 
06:16:21.510 --> 06:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
the past couple of years we can't go
 
06:16:23.990 --> 06:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
back when people were absolutely
 
06:16:27.430 --> 06:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
terrified and that was all of us
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
to leave our homes because we didn't
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
know what we were dealing with i think
 
06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
schools did the best job that they could
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
but different communities had different
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
degrees of outbreak on and off
 
06:16:40.958 --> 06:16:42.310 align:start position:0%
degrees of outbreak on and off
i

06:16:42.310 --> 06:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:16:44.150 --> 06:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm afraid that we're throwing the
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
baby out with the bathwater and that
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have the opportunity
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
a good opportunity that schools can use
 
06:16:56.708 --> 06:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
with permission from their local boards
 
06:16:59.270 --> 06:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to respond in a way that
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
the well-being of everybody whether it's
 
06:17:05.670 --> 06:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
that you know the river floods or uh i
 
06:17:07.110 --> 06:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
don't know where you were last night but
 
06:17:09.750 --> 06:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
i thought my roof was coming off
 
06:17:12.868 --> 06:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
so i i would just ask you
 
06:17:14.390 --> 06:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
to not
 
06:17:14.400 --> 06:17:16.310 align:start position:0%
to not
pre-judge

06:17:16.310 --> 06:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
pre-judge
 
06:17:18.628 --> 06:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
thinking that somehow or another these
 
06:17:20.310 --> 06:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers don't want to be in
 
06:17:23.830 --> 06:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
their classrooms i've talked to so many
 
06:17:24.868 --> 06:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
of them
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
and they have been almost a single voice
 
06:17:31.430 --> 06:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
in being absolutely delighted to be back
 
06:17:33.510 --> 06:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
at school
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%

so we have it all happening in one
 
06:19:41.990 --> 06:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
location where the tech people can give

us the support we need
 
06:19:50.070 --> 06:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
