up good morning good morning Mr chair

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
happy to see you again this time we're
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
going to talk Revenue
 
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
estimates sounds good we're looking
 
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
forward to
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
it you may be okay so you should have a
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
copy of a presentation in front of you
 
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
blue and white maybe we should make it
 
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
green and white for money I don't know
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
change it up next year
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
maybe okay so what we're going to talk
 
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
about today is kind of three things
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about where we think
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
revenues for fiscal year 25 the current
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that we're in where revenues
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
are going to end up at the end of June
 
00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of the fiscal
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
year then we're going to talk about a
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
growth rate from 25 to 26 and then a
 
00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 align:start position:0%
growth rate from 26 to
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
27 so what you see on the first page is
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.230 align:start position:0%
these are
the

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
scenarios that we run at Dr in order to
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
come up with options for where fiscal
 
00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.790 align:start position:0%
come up with options for where fiscal
year

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
25 is going to end because that's going
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
to serve as our base for the growth
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
rates for 26 and 27 so there's five
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
different scenarios that we look at
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
first is plan what was the plan for that
 
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.550 align:start position:0%
first is plan what was the plan for that
tax

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
type second is sustaining percent versus
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
plan so we look at at the first seven
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
months of the fiscal year and we look at
 
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
how that's performing compared to plan
 
00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
and we apply that same percentage to the
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
remaining months so if through the first
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
seven months of the year we're 10% ahead
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
of plan we're just going to assume that
 
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
we'll stay 10% ahead of plan for the
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
rest of the
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
year the third scenario is the same
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
thing except we're comparing to Prior
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
year so we take actuals for the first
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
seven months and then we look at how
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing compared to Prior year if
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're 5% ahead of Prior year we're going
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
to assume we'll remain 5% ahead of Prior
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
year for the rest of fiscal year
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
25 the fourth scenario is the first
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
seven months of the year with just plan
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
remainder and then the last scenario is
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
the first seven months of the year with
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
prior year actuals for the last five so
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
we run these five scenarios we update
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
them at the end of every month so once
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
we have actual data we'll update it and
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
then we select a high and a low based on
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
these scenarios and those are the
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
options that are going to be presented
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
to you that's how we come up with a
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
range for fiscal year 25 I will say
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
though that the options that we select
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
for the high and the low are those that
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
we believe to be reasonable so if for
 
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
instance tobacco tax we are far below
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
plan we're not going to show you the
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
plan scenario as an option because we
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that's achievable in
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 so it's not just running
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
five scenarios and showing you the
 
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
absolute High and the absolute low it's
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
us looking at those those scenarios and
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
making an educated decision on what we
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
believe to be a reasonable High and a
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable low so we kind of try to take
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
noise so that's what we do for 25 and
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
then we just talk growth rates for 26 27
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
Chris works his magic and applies those
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
growth rates in your worksheet and way
 
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.309 align:start position:0%
growth rates in your worksheet and way
you

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
go okay so on page two we're going to do
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
the heavy lifting first we're going to
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
taxes so fiscal year to date business
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
taxes are 110.3 million or 18.2% below
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
plan and we're
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
102.9 million or
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
things to consider when you're
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
estimating business tax revenue first is
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
e economic growth with the resetting of
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
estimated payments we've talked about
 
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.949 align:start position:0%
estimated payments we've talked about
this

00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
before the there is underlying growth in
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
the economy we are seeing that but we've
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
seen a reduction in our estimated
 
00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
payments of businesses have as
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
businesses have right sized their
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
estimated payments kind of coming out of
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and the tremendous growth
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we we saw on corporate profits so
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
there is growth here but you're looking
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
below plan and you're you're below prior
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
year partially due to this resetting of
 
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:10.470 align:start position:0%
year partially due to this resetting of
estimated

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
payments also things to think about
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
supply chain constraints disruptions
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
Imports in factories potential tariffs
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
or sanctions that's very much an unknown
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
I think at this
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
point uh we do have a low unemployment
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
rate which is good for the economy and
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
then any impact on interest rate changes
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
um to the economy as
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
well so what you see in the blue section
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the page is a range for
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.630 align:start position:0%
 
b12.3

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
b12.3
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
million then you see a growth range for
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
26 between 3 to 8% that would be applied
 
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
26 between 3 to 8% that would be applied
to

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
25 and then you see a growth range for
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
27 again of 3 to 8% and that would be
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
applied to
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
26 so for fiscal year 25 your range the
 
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:08.790 align:start position:0%
26 so for fiscal year 25 your range the
low

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
range assumes actual revenue for the
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
first seven months of the year and
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
assumes that our percent versus plan
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
18.2% below plan would remain for the
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
remaining five months of the year so
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
that revenues just continue on the trend
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
that they're on from the first seven
 
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.470 align:start position:0%
that they're on from the first seven
months

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
the high assumes that we take the seven
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
months of actuals and then the remaining
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
five months are actual revenue from last
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
year from fiscal year 24 and essentially
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
what this high does is assumes that the
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
decline in the estimated payments that
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
stops and that revenue is more
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with the prior year so that
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
means 25 estimates which we just start
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
to receive in April and we'll receive
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
again in June calendar year 25 estimates
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
are consistent with calendar year 24 and
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
we don't continue to see that decline
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
from 24 estimates that we saw from 23 so
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
the resetting of e of estimates kind of
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
has happened and we're just going to
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
kind of continue
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
on with fiso year 24 or excuse me with
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
how calendar year
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
24 behaved excuse me can I ask a
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
um so in the previous slide you you
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
listed five different ways that um
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
revenues uh could be estimated so when
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
you when you on this chart now when you
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
give the high and low which one is your
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
which method are you using so you'll see
 
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
that in the little sub bullet Below in
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
um the kind of open bullet it said
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
assumes actual revenue for the first
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
seven months of the year plus sustaining
 
00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
percent versus plan okay for the last
 
00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
percent versus plan okay for the last
five

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
and then for the high this is actual
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
revenue for the first seven months with
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
prior year revenue for the last five so
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
again it's it's showing you the two high
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
and low options we believe to be
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
reasonable yeah okay thank you yes
 
00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:17.790 align:start position:0%
reasonable yeah okay thank you yes
repres

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
repres
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
elme thank you
 
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
elme thank you
so

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
on what the way we we've been doing it
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to pay much attention to
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
the possibility of
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
decline continuing and the decline
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
continuing is the low estimate that
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
assumes that the
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
18% versus plan continues for the
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
remainder of the
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
Year FY 25 the last five
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
months uh isn't that when we were
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
seeing well we were yeah we were seeing
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
the the decline from a number of
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
different factors we don't know how
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
important one of them versus the other
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
one is yet though um so this assumes
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
have you got
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh done any
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
analysis um lately of how much of the
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
decline last year was due to to just um
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
changing their estimates based on oh oh
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
we've been keeping 300% of
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
our of our
 
00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
uh taxes to
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
come uh that we don't need to keep in
 
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.949 align:start position:0%
come uh that we don't need to keep in
the

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
treasury so we
 
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.509 align:start position:0%
treasury so we
can't

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
isolate individual or we can't isolate
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
the impact of Chang in estimated
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
payments because of the CCO cap and the
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
need need to now refund any credit carry
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
over over 500% versus a change in
 
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
Behavior because businesses now feel
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
more confident in what their liability
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be so I can't tell you what
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
part of the reduction in estimates is
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
due to one or the other I can tell you
 
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
how much we refunded due to the CCO cap
 
00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
um but I can't necessarily break down
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
the change in the behavior of the
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
estimates because I don't have any
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
information to do that because as we've
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
talked about an estimate is one number
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
on a form with very little
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
information so that being
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
said I think there's two bits of
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.069 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
first is that
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
approximately just under $72 million in
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 was refunded due to the
 
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.110 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 was refunded due to the
CCO

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
CCO
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
cap year to date for fiscal year
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
to with respect
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
to changes
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
in liability of
 
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers versus the change in their
 
00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:58.519 align:start position:0%
behavior relative to estimates again I
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
can't isolate
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
necessarily I can't
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
isolate that specifically in the
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
estimates but I can do a comparison
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
between how taxpayers have made their
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
estimated payments as a comparison to
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
how their liability has
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
changed and so
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
2021 liability for taxpayers increased
 
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.509 align:start position:0%
2021 liability for taxpayers increased
by

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
40% from tax year 21 to
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
22 their liability increased by
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
1% but their estimated payments
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
increased by
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
46% so that's the behavior that we're
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
talking about where there has been a
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
behavior among taxpayers to increase
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
their estimated payments in excess of
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
their liability we saw a similar Trend
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
happen from 2016 to 2017 when the tax
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
cut and jobs act went into effect and
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers were uncertain about their
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
estimate uncertain about their liability
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
they sent SE they had a 75% increase in
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
their estimates so when taxpayers aren't
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
sure many just want to make sure they're
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
covered and so they'll increase their
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
estimated payments it takes a couple
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
years for them to then adjust the
 
00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:32.039 align:start position:0%
estimated payments when the liability
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't risen by the same
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
percent so the interesting thing here
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we won't know this until after March
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
15 when tax returns come in then you can
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
start looking at the liability and is a
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
liability correct down as well or is
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
that about the same and a lot of this is
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
estimates correct so that will will
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
start to have information in March um in
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
April as returns are filed the picture
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
won't be totally clear until we get
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
those returns that are filed on
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
extension in the fall and do you have
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
anyone filing returns now because people
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
who are on um fiscal years do you have
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
any of them filing such that you can
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
compare that so we did look at what has
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
happened from fiscal year 20 or excuse
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
me tax year 22 to tax year 23 but even
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
that is incomplete at this point so it
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
looks like the liability is down but
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
it's not a full year and some of those
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal filers tend to be um our larger
 
00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so it is not a full picture
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
yet but yeah we're kind of constantly
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
tracking and waiting for those returns
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
to come in and we we have to make our
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
decisions prior to March 15
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you do y but um but we
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
have a crystal ball obviously
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
just a quick question uh commissioner I
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
think those numbers are really important
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
and and I'm wondering if you could make
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
sure that you provide the committee with
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
with those numbers in terms of the
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
difference between liability and and um
 
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.190 align:start position:0%
difference between liability and and um
and

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
also the the estimated numbers pay I'm I
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
I can't do the math in my head but I was
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
trying to it it seemed like that that
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
seven-month figure was consistent
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
with you know potentially in terms of
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
percent percentage was consistent with
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
what a full year should produce but um
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
it'd be helpful to Havey to thank you
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
representative om yeah thank you I have
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
a question on economic growth versus tax
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
growth and the basis for my question is
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
a recent kinger letter I got talking
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
about economic growth in the total
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
country uh they said the growth is 2.8%
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
last year and declining at 2.4% this
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
year and we're forecasting 8 % uh tax
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
growth here in New Hampshire can you
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
comment on the correlation between the
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
tax growth and the economic growth here
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire sure so I think the
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
easiest way to discuss that is just to
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
equate economic growth to GDP right
 
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
change in gross domestic product so
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
we've looked over the years to see
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
whether and how strong a correlation
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
might be between GDP and the change in
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
the tax revenue in New Hampshire for the
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
business business taxes and I think
 
00:20:32.909 --> 00:20:32.919 align:start position:0%
there's a few things that make it so
 
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
that there's not a direct correlation
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
one is the timing so when you're talking
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
about um the timing of growth in the
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
economy because of how taxes are
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
ultimately reported up to almost a year
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
after the tax year closes we don't
 
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:55.240 align:start position:0%
always have that timely information to
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
make that direct
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
correlation second there are things I
 
00:21:04.549 --> 00:21:04.559 align:start position:0%
think that make New Hampshire I don't
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
want to say necessarily unique but we've
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that we have a
 
00:21:09.549 --> 00:21:09.559 align:start position:0%
variety of
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
Industries um within New Hampshire we're
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
not heavily reliant on any one or two
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
industries but that the makeup of our
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
Industries might be different than the
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
general economy that is referenced
 
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.549 align:start position:0%
general economy that is referenced
within

00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
GDP um we might have more manufacturing
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
or l manufacturing more healthare less
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
healthare different technology companies
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
and so the makeup of we're not just an
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
exact subset of the national
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
economy um so I think that creates a
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
well so now you said there in answering
 
00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
that question there's a delay between um
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
GDP and tax um filings which makes sense
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
is there a way to compare GDP would I
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
mean knowing that it's skewed GDP with
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
the tax return it's probably like more
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
like six month I don't know is it a year
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
you said a year later but it's it's
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
tough because of that the estimates are
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
filed somewhat timely across the tax
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
year but they only need to be
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
essentially equal to the prior Year's
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
liability in order to avoid any
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
penalties and if you have a credit on
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
file which we know many taxpayers do
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
then that gives you some more leeway as
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
well and
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to get the whole picture
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
and what we really need is that
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
information off of the tax return to see
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
where various line items have
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
changed to make the picture complete and
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
then that is so delayed yeah okay that
 
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.990 align:start position:0%
then that is so delayed yeah okay that
makes

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
sense okay seeing no more questions okay
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
continue so we come up with the range
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 25
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
and then the growth rate
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
from 26 and 27 you'll see it's 3 to 8%
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
in both years
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
and that's based on um taxpayers kind of
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
finishing their adjustment to their
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
estimated payments the estimated
 
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
payments have now been kind of right
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
sized if you will in fiscal year
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
24 um and the first half of 25 and so
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
now we go into more of um a true
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
reflection of estimates to what's
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
happening in the
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
economy um and then in
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
27 this you know kind of is just the
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
general growth that you would see in the
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
business profits and business Enterprise
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
tax um from the slides from my prior
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
presentations business taxes do
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuate quite a bit from year to year
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
um but when you remove the noise you
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
remove the years where there's a large
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
growth or a large decline 3 to 8% is
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
kind of the
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
more classic growth um that you would
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
see in the taxes um from year to year so
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
I am forecasting an increase it's a bit
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
of a wider range um just because of
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty relative to what the
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
estimated payments um are going to look
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
like for calendar year 25 but I don't I
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to continue to
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
see a significant decline in revenues
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
the CCO cap is now fully in effect and
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
um businesses I I believe um have kind
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
of done that right sizing of their
 
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
of done that right sizing of their
estimated

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
payments okay moving on to page
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
three the meals and rentals tax just as
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
a reminder the majority of the tax about
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
80% is meals 18% is rooms and 2% are
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle rentals year-to date we
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
are uh 6.9 million or 3.3% ahead of plan
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
and 6.8 million or 3.3% ahead of Prior
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
year things to think about is how
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
inflation has impacted the cost of meals
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
um travel trends that we've seen you
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
know post pandemic as we've talked about
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
I think everybody realized how much they
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
like to eat out and how much they like
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
to travel and so we've kind of seen a
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
new Norm relative to um travel and the
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
benefits to M&amp;R Revenue associated with
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
that and then two things that are unique
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
to the meals and rentals tax there is a
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
transfer as we talked about to the
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue fund this goes to U
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities this is roughly 30% of
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
the tax it's a little bit more of a
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
convoluted calculation than that but
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's roughly
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
30% and then School building a Debt
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
Service which there is a schedule for
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
that um both of those Chris has a lovely
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
calculator for that and he will
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
calculate those for you so all you need
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
to worry about is um kind of the gross
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
revenue and then he'll do the
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
calculations to deduct the municipal
 
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue transfer and the school building
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
Aid so you don't need to worry about
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
that so for fiscal year 25 um we're
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
million when you take out the transfers
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
to the municipal Revenue fund and the
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
school building Aid you get a net range
 
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.470 align:start position:0%
school building Aid you get a net range
of

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:45.690 align:start position:0%
of
331.82

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:45.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
335.25926 would assume that we um that
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
amount ahead of plan does
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
decline and then for the high this
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
assumes the actual revenue for the first
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
seven months and then assumes that we
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
continue at that 3.3% for the remainder
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
Year looking at growth ranges for 26 and
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
27 you'll see 2 to 5% in each year that
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
low of 2% is less than what we're seeing
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
now so it assumes that there is some
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
slowing to the revenue whether that's
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
the result of um inflation increasing or
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
prices increasing and that getting to a
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
point where consumers decide to consume
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
fewer meals and room rentals and then
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
the 5% is just again very typical growth
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
year-over-year um to M&amp;R that's kind of
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
our average growth rate um and so that's
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative elmy thank you uh I think
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh too early to
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
be to be estimating this but
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be a lot of
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
distress among the um people in the
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
middle and the lower levels of our
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
income span
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
um because the cost of housing is grown
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
so high and a number of other things
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
like that cost of
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
eggs and
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's any sign that fewer
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
people are are eating out at this point
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
or whether they're going down to Burger
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
King instead of to
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
to uh Three Tomatoes which is a the one
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the fanciest places in
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon so we have seen when you compare
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
to Prior
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
year during fiscal year 25 we have seen
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
some fluctuation so if you're looking at
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
July for instance which would be based
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
on sales in June July was 6% ahead of
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
Prior year August was 2% below
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
um September was ahead by six October
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
was 3% below November and December were
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
both good months at 8 and 10% ahead of
 
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
Prior year and then January was 1% below
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
so to your point I think there might be
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an impact of
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
um folks kind of re-evaluating what sort
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
of disposable income they have or what
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
portion of their income they want to
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
spend on things that are taxable under
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R um so if that were to be a
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
significant consideration then I think
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
going with the low end of the range you
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
know that that would move you towards
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
the lower end of the range and if I
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
could just follow follow up follow up
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
all of that gets distorted by was there
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
good weather or bad weather in X
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
month sure
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we had a pretty good foliage
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
season yeah um and that might be what
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
seeing reflected in the November and
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
December which would be October and
 
00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
December which would be October and
November

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue um I personally like the snow I
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
know that's not a universal feeling but
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
these bits of snow that we've been
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
getting I think there's more snow
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
forecasted for Thursday and maybe again
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
over the weekend that's great um traffic
 
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
on 93 going north has been quite busy um
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
and so that will be beneficial um to us
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
minus having to deal with the no yes
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
when you said January was down 1% is
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
that from the previous January that's
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
from the previous January okay
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
yep and that little of a change could
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
honestly just be due to the municipal
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue transfer because that's the net
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
amount um not the gross and the
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue transfers based on the
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
prior year Revenue so we could have had
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
a higher transfer in that month which
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
would result in just that little
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
decrease okay thank you um did I see
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
someone else no okay thank
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
you tobacco
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
tax so fiscal year to date we are 18.1
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
million or 14% below
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
plan we are 5.6 million or 4.8% below
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
prior year stamp sales are declining
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that but other
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco products including ecigarettes
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
those sales have been
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
growing and other things to consider
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
again as we've discussed avail of
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
products in surrounding states and that
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
crossborder elasticity how much um
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
demand are we seeing from people coming
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
across the border to buy tobacco
 
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
products here in New
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so for fiscal year 25 again we
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
have a pretty tight range of 182.5
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
185.30 14% that we are currently below
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
plan that that would stay for the
 
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
remainder of the prior um remainder of
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
this year for the last five months so
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
basically the trend against plan will
 
00:32:32.679 --> 00:32:33.590 align:start position:0%
basically the trend against plan will
just

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
continue and then the high
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
assumes that the remainder of the year
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
will actually go back to being what it
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
was in the prior year so even though
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
we're 4.8% below prior year that maybe
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
we've kind of reached the bottom and
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
that we will be equal to Prior year for
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
the last five
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
months looking uh at fiscal year 26 the
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
range is- 5% to minus 3% and then for 27
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're at minus 3% to um just flat growth
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
those of you have been on the committee
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
for a while might know that minus 3% was
 
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
always kind of my go-to um
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation for tobacco tax revenue
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
prior to um the taxation of ecigarettes
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
it was just a pretty constant Trend
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
minus 3% year-over-year
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
we then had covid and the Banning of
 
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:32.559 align:start position:0%
products in other states which increased
 
00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:33.350 align:start position:0%
products in other states which increased
our

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
Revenue but we have are seeing that kind
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
of Trail off and kind of go back to
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
normal Trends so that's where that kind
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
of minus 3% comes
 
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
from any questions on tobaccoes Aly look
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
like you have a question on I yes I
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
think I think we may have discussed this
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
before on we have an extremely low tax
 
00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
on on cannab
 
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:01.720 align:start position:0%
products and
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
uh the qu and the we know that that is
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
growing that people are switching from
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
cigarettes that we tax at fairly High
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
rates but lower than everybody else
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
around us uh
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
and and there is a gulf between that and
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
what we're taxing cannabis products and
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
um is there any way do you think it
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
would make a significant difference to
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
segregate out out that product and
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
multiply it by two or something like
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
that um when you mean when you say canis
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
do you mean ecigarettes ecigarettes okay
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so and other vaping and other yes
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
other vaping products so um just as a
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
reminder ecigarettes are taxed as
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Aly said at a different
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
rate than traditional cigarettes and add
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
a different rate than other other
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco products um and that rate
 
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
depends on whether they're a clothed
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
system or an open system um you know
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
where you're just buying um the liquid
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a clothed system where
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
everything's contained and when you're
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
done with it you throw it out
 
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
um we could look
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
at what the impact would be if just
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes continued to grow let me
 
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
just look at where we
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
are so fiscal year to date we're
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
basically flat to Prior year relative to
 
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.430 align:start position:0%
basically flat to Prior year relative to
ecigarette

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
ecigarette
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
revenue um it fluctuates month to month
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
but basically at this time last year in
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 we had 5.5 million in
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue related to ecigarettes and in
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 through January we have
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
five .45 so we're about $500,000 off
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
so sure so fiscal year 24 through
 
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
January ecigarette revenue was 5.5
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
million and fiscal year 25 through
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
5.45 where we are
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
seeing growth recently is relative to
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products that are not
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes so those are taxed at the
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
full OTP rate of 65.0 3% that has grown
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
20% year to date what are other tobacco
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
products so that would be your pipe
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco your loose tobacco your chewing
 
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.380 align:start position:0%
tobacco your loose tobacco your chewing
tobacco

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:50.390 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:51.790 align:start position:0%
tobacco
[Music]

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
your single cigarettes GLS yep um any
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
sort of like like pouch or I am not well
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
versed in tobacco products but any sort
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
of um like pouch that you would put in
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
your mouth um those sorts of
 
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.550 align:start position:0%
your mouth um those sorts of
noncombustible

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
yeah to call them
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
Bandits there's lots of
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
terms um um could you that was 45
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
million so that was last year fiscal
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
year to date through January for other
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco products that are not
 
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes was 14.4
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
million and this year fiscal year to
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
million so combined ecigarettes and
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products year to date were
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
right around 20 million a little bit
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
higher than 20
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
million total toal tobacco tax revenue
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
year-to date is 111 million so still the
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
majority of our revenue is coming from
 
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.230 align:start position:0%
majority of our revenue is coming from
stamped

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
cigarettes could I just get a
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
clarification yes on the uh EIG include
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh the open system correct thank you
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
correct repres
 
00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
y thank you in the past we've U
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
benefited substantially from Vermont
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
Maine in
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um won't say anything
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
about New York people
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
bringing but anyway the uh question is
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
do you have a historical analysis of a
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of increase that takes place
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
when our biggest competitor
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts would
 
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
raise X number of cents New Hampshire
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
benefits y number of cents or maybe X
 
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.190 align:start position:0%
benefits y number of cents or maybe X
Plus

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
sense I don't have that offand it's
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
something that we could look into the
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
only thing that I have a caution based
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
on recent history is and the the best
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
example is when Massachusetts banned
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
flavored products right so you couldn't
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
buy menthol cigarettes in Massachusetts
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
anymore that resulted in a pretty
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
significant increase in demand for um
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
menthol cigarettes in New Hampshire we
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
heard that from the wholesalers we heard
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
that from the
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
retailers it's not a
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
forever bump it tends to bump at the
 
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.790 align:start position:0%
forever bump it tends to bump at the
initial

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
initial
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
change and
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
then either it has the intended effect
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
of the band and people of the ban and
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
people decide not to purchase that
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
product anymore or they find other ways
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
to purchase it other than coming across
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
the border so whether they purchase it
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
online or do something else
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
so sometimes those bumps result or
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes those changes result in an
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
initial bump but it's not a
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
sustained change or increase to the
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
revenue follow up um thank you Mr chair
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
both with meals and rooms and since
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're terate both with meals and rooms
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
and with
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
tobacco um it it seems to me that that
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
initial bump uh based
 
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
upon concurrent changes in tax law of
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
our neighbors plus the arc that follows
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
that might be beneficial for
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
prognostication if we know that for
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
example Massachusetts has already
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
indicated that they are raising their
 
00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:44.670 align:start position:0%
indicated that they are raising their
taxes

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
by some stupid number um to raise less
 
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480 align:start position:0%
money okay
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
um that would benefit
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
us in a certain category uh of
 
00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:01.270 align:start position:0%
us in a certain category uh of
percentage

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
range um real dollars aren't important
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
because they've stop being
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
important um it's the percentage of
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
change so if we have some idea what the
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
bump is and then what the the following
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
Arc is yep whether it's up or down would
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
give us a an an idea on these two
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
tourist taxes right exactly where you
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
well this one in alcohol as well I mean
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
right where you would want to be within
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
the growth range right and I'm also
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
aware that uh liquor is spending uh uh
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
some strong energy on Border
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
Stores um to take advantage of that but
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
if if we had some real numbers I think
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
liquor and uh your tobacco retailers
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
could then rely on maybe I need to hire
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of more people maybe I don't
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
whatever it's that information would be
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
beneficial thank you let us well isn't
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
let me just um say isn't the information
 
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
you're asking for uh presupposes that
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
mass is increasing and are they in the
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
process of
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
increasing yes Mr chair mass is is in
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
the process they always are but is in
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
the process of
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
increasing uh from what I've heard um on
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
radio programs and you know the news and
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
stuff like that it's anecdotal at this
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
point till they actually do but when
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
they actually do we we
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
benefit and it would be interesting to
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
know what we benefit and whether the
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
follow on is what the what I'm looking
 
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
for rather than anecdotal we know we
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
know we benefit but what do we benefit
 
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
is the question sure let us go back and
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
see if we can
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
isolate see if we can find a time where
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
a rate change where we can really
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
isolate a rate change one concern so
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
when they banned the the the flavored
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
products in Massachusetts it was also at
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
a time that we were just seeing
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
increased consumption overall due to
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
covid so I wouldn't want I don't think I
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
have a way to isolate that and I
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to conflate the two but
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
let us look back at when they've done
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
just strict rate changes and see if we
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
can see what might happen see if we have
 
00:43:18.349 --> 00:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
any data that would show yeah I I would
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
suggest going back to when uh
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aly was a chair and
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
representing um major were chair we had
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
a similar discussion
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh what five seven years
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
ago yeah but the see we can isolate it
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative om yeah I
 
00:43:40.109 --> 00:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
just had kind of a high level question
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about numbers around
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
$29 million but looking at the chart
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
that says tobacco tax 182 million so can
 
00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
you is that the national settlement that
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
makes up that big oh no so when I was
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
saying the um the number that I was
 
00:43:59.470 --> 00:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
quoting was fiscal year to date so we we
 
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.270 align:start position:0%
quoting was fiscal year to date so we we
have

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
111 million in tax fiscal year to date
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
and roughly 20 million of that Revenue
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date is from OTP and
 
00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:11.230 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date is from OTP and
ecigarettes

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
so you don't have the full so the 185 is
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
the five more months of Revenue you
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
don't have the full year in
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
that the tobacco settlement I believe is
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
going to be estimated separately um with
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
numbers provided by the Department of
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
Justice if I'm understanding his concern
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
when you look at low of
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
29.7 if that's 7 months you're never
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
going to get to sorry that it's it's
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
written a little awkwardly that's 29.7
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
million or 14% below plan so in those
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
first seven months or or is that at the
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
end of the year the low estimate assumes
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
that we would end the year 29.7 million
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
or 14 it's just a coincidence that it's
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
very close to the other numbers that we
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
were talking about representative
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you um another thing that
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
worked back in the day when I was first
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
chair uh Brian gotl came in he's he's
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
the gentleman the the conservative
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
Economist who used to be a consultant uh
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
that that is producing all of our labor
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
work estimates at this point on he did a
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
um analysis of the what was affecting
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax um revenues
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
and the thing that came out strongest
 
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
was the difference between the price of
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
gas in New Hampshire and Massachusetts
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh on down
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
through through even New York uh that
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
people would come up uh knowing the they
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
could get get a lot cheaper gas at the
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
same time that they were getting cheaper
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and um and maybe go skiing or
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
something and
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
um it was an interesting analysis and we
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
we aren't haven't been looking at that
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
lately and I don't know whether it would
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
be worth looking at it again I think
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
part of that I I remember that analysis
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
I think think part of that
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
um assumes that the the main way that
 
00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
people purchase cigarettes is in person
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
yeah which I believe is true but I think
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
there's probably more of an
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
online availability of pro of certain
 
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
products at this point more so than 5 10
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
years ago um but yes there there was a
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
the price of gas was definitely um a
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
factor in the number of of stamps that
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
we were selling packs of cigarettes that
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
selling thank you thank you oh followup
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
yeah um well just for information
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
purposes um the tobacco settlement
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
requires and I think does some of the
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
work themselves uh that that we go after
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.870 align:start position:0%
any uh
untaxed

00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
untaxed
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
online yes there's diligent enforcement
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions within the tobacco settlement
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that um we we lose a
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
lot of money if we don't do it
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
correct I've got a whole group at Dr
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
that that's their job is to audit
 
00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
purposes okay on to page
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
tax I'm just going to cut to the chase
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
on this cuz there's a lot going on here
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
and I think really what you need to know
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
is that the tax was repealed as of
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
January 1st
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
2025 we will receive Revenue in 2025 for
 
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
2024 but we're not going to receive
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
April and June estimated payments in 25
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to really receive
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
any money in 26 or
 
00:48:29.079 --> 00:48:30.790 align:start position:0%
any money in 26 or
27

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
27
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
would if you assume
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
that our the revenue that we
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
receive um without the tax being
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
repealed was going to be equal in 25 to
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
24 so no change and then you apply the
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
repeal based on the timing of
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
historically how revenues have been
 
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.430 align:start position:0%
historically how revenues have been
received

00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
revenue for fiscal year 25 would be
 
00:49:00.359 --> 00:49:03.230 align:start position:0%
revenue for fiscal year 25 would be
134.5

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
134.5
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
million you would have 8.7 million of
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue in 26 and then you would have no
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue in
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
27 so you can I'm sorry what was 26
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
again 26 was 8.7 million so that can
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
essentially be your be your Revenue
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
estimates 8.7 in 26 and none in 27 that
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
8.7 residual in 26 is um we still have
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
audit and enforcement and collection
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
Authority um not everyone is able to
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
file their returns and pay on time um so
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of residual in any
 
00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
year that we're collecting from prior
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
years so that 8.7 is just kind of
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
showing a little bit of residual that
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
will will come in in fiscal 26 and then
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
27 represent elme
 
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh your um blue
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
section says that you don't believe
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
significant Revenue coming out uh in 26
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
or 27 correct 8.7 so just under 10
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
million is essentially the result in 8.7
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
and then in 26 and then nothing in 27
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you page six is the
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
communication Services
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
tax this is one of the smaller tax types
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
roughly $30
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
million so fiscal year to date we're
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
400,000 or 2.3 million below
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
plan and 900,000 or 4.9% below prior
 
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.349 align:start position:0%
plan and 900,000 or 4.9% below prior
year

00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
um again we've talked about this in the
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the prior
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
sessions this is just a shift in how
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
people are using two-way Communications
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
the move away from having a cell phone
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
and a landline and then also kind of the
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
shift in your billing on your cell phone
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
plan and dedicating more of your bill
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
towards your data as opposed to your
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
voice or two-way
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
communication so the range for fiscal
 
00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
year 25 again is quite small 29 .1
 
00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
million to 30 million the low assumes
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
the first s months of 25 plus
 
00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.390 align:start position:0%
the first s months of 25 plus
the

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
4.9% that we've been below plan for the
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
last five and then the high assumes that
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
we meet plan in terms of growth rates
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
for 26 to 27 minus 3% to zero so again
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
as as we've talked about we've seen a
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
bit of a decline in the tax but it seems
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
to have kind of evened out um so I would
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
anticip I wouldn't expect it to grow but
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't expect it to significantly
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
Decline and is that decline primarily
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
the 3% decline primarily landlines going
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
away I would say at this point it's
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
probably the shift in your billing on
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
your cell phone dedicating more of your
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone bill to data which is not
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
taxable and less to texting in voice um
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
which is taxable I
 
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.710 align:start position:0%
which is taxable I
see

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay um I just for reference um CST fell
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
about just about 3% from 22 to 23 grew
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
slightly from 23 to 24
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
um but it's been fairly consistent at
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
that 30 million over the past few
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
years is any do we have any idea why it
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
grew from 23 to
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
24 it honestly could just be the timing
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
of payments and when you know when we
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
say grew it grew from 30.1 million to
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
30.6 million okay so yeah it that could
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
just be a timing difference in terms of
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
payment um I guess I'm just looking at
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
these numbers again 22 to 23 went down
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's not like so I understand even
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
though it's potentially a timing issue a
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
decrease of 3% for the next over the
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
next two years um each year might
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
actually be too much well looking
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
further back from that there was a
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
decrease um from 20 to 21 of a half a
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
percent from 19 to 20 a 3.6% decrease so
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing any like looking
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
backwards I'm not really seeing any
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
growth that's why I think that 1.7% 1%
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
growth is probably just an anomalous mhm
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't forecast any growth related
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
to this tax
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
okay but it's possible that the 3%
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
decline in in both those years could be
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
well that's why you have it on the low
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
range yeah okay right I think that's the
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
scenario all right thank you
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
page seven real estate transfer
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
tax so fiscal year to date we are 8.9
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
million or 6.5% below
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
plan and we are 8.6 million or
 
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
7.2% ahead of Prior Year we're seeing as
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
we've talked about a little bit of a
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
recovery relative to the real estate
 
00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
recovery relative to the real estate
transfer

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
tax you will need to um estimate the
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
gross and then there is a $5 million
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
transfer to the affordable housing fund
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
that happens every year so that will
 
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
come out after you've applied your
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
growth and Chris will handle that for
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
you things to consider Mortgage in
 
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
interest rates at their current rates
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
they seem to be
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
steady um I think that has likely pushed
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
people out of the market um but at some
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
point if they remain where they are
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
people are going to get tired of waiting
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
if they don't think that mortgage rates
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
are going to come down I think you will
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
see people enter the
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
market median sale prices as we talked
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
about have remained High um and then the
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
lack of of inventory um continues to to
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
be a
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
problem so for fiscal year
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
25 the low after transfers of
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
197.4 and a high of
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
2011.1 the low assumes that the
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
remaining 5 months of the year will be
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
at that um
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
7.2% ahead of Prior
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
year and the high assumes that we will
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh reach plan in each of the months
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
remaining I will say that
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
7% ahead of Prior year that has
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
been effectively growing each month
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
we've been performing quite well
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
ahead uh quite well compared to Prior
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
year so I there is a bright light we
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
started the year in July at um 3% below
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
August was 6% below that same month in a
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
prior year but then we've grown 14 16 12
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
10 and 15% for each month respectively
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
so so Rett is showing some signs of life
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
after a couple years
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
of decline
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
repres El me I think that this would be
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
a question for the
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
Realtors but how much of this may be the
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
growth in um
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
corporations investment companies
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
investing in New Hampshire Housing and
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
Lebanon um if you bear with me for one
 
00:57:40.079 --> 00:57:59.910 align:start position:0%
Lebanon um if you bear with me for one
second

00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
so if it is a real estate holding
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
company that's
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
transferring ownership in holding
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
companies those are reported to us
 
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
separately um and they don't come
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
counties um I can say though that the
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
totals fiscal year to date are 3% ahead
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the prior year so we we are I think
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
just seeing being not to say that what
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
you're um discussing representative Aly
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
isn't happening but I will say that that
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
is not the sole reason why we're seeing
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
an increase in R we're seeing underlying
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
increase in transactions at the county
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
level so potentially multiple things
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
there representative Spar wouldn't the
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
increase also be the fact that we've
 
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
seen substantial appreciation of
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
property and and you've got a transfer
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
tax that's based on the value of the
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
property correct so whenever we talk
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
about the real estate transfer tax we
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
have to talk about both sides which is
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
you can have the higher
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
transaction um amounts and decreased
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
transaction numbers you can have higher
 
00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
transaction numbers at lower costs but
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
at some point that breaks I think what
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're seeing right now is both we're
 
00:59:20.029 --> 00:59:20.039 align:start position:0%
seeing the transaction volume increase
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we are at historic highs for the
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
median prices so I think both of those
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
things are driving um
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax revenue at
 
00:59:28.079 --> 00:59:28.870 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax revenue at
this

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
point represent
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner could you just you you
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
indicated you were just saying month by
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
month the comparison of 25 to 24 yeah
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
and and if I'm remembering or if I heard
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
it correctly it sounded like we were
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
doing better in months that would not
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
typically be favorable to real estate
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
sales but the winter months
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
correct or late fall winter am I
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
remember am I getting that right you're
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
right and so those numbers that were I
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
was reading off were comparison to the
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
same month in the prior year um and to
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
that same point we are seeing increases
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the transaction volumes again same
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
months to the prior year so these are
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
months that if we were seeing decreases
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
I would just say yep that's what happens
 
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
this is just a tough time a year to sell
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
a house nobody likes to take pictures of
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
a house with snow in the front yard you
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
know it always looks better with
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
flowers um but it seems like there is
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
increased activity that's enough to kind
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
of overcome those those lower
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
months follow up Mr chair follow up so
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
did I just hear you correctly so at
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
least the compared to Prior year it's
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
not just an increase in amount it's also
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just an increase in the value
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
of the property it's also an increase in
 
01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
the number of transactions
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
correct which which may be indicative of
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
people getting tired of waiting perhaps
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
right getting tired of waiting
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that maybe the interest
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
rates are not going to come down as fast
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
as they went up and needing to kind of
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
jump into the
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
pool thank you RS and vs thank you Mr
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
so approximately if you have an idea how
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
far would the rates have to come down in
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
order to stimulate buying just the rates
 
01:01:39.069 --> 01:01:39.079 align:start position:0%
themselves the other half of that
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
equation is you need the
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
inventory so they've got to come down
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
enough to put people into the market but
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
then they there need to be enough houses
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
for those people to buy MH and that's
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
outside of my
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
expertise okay followup follow up so if
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
you would pass on to the realer
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
Association that you know it's not a
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
problem here in New Hampshire with snow
 
01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
right I mean we have no bad weather
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
right what they need are pictures with
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
kids and smiles holding skis
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
right you can't see how dead the grass
 
01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:20.990 align:start position:0%
is on my lawn when it's covered in
 
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:24.589 align:start position:0%
is on my lawn when it's covered in
[Laughter]

01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
snow any the Maple
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
Leaves right all right no more questions
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
on that no okay last tax utility
 
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.029 align:start position:0%
on that no okay last tax utility
property

01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
tax again relatively small
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
um somewhere around 45 million each year
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
but fiscal year to date we're 1.3
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
million or 5.8% ahead of plan and we are
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
6 million or 2.5% below prior year
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
as a refresher this is a tax where Dr
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
determines the value of the utility
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
property that property owner um pays
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
$6.60 per thousand of their uh
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
valuation um so as property values
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
fluctuate that will obviously impact the
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
tax any new property that's brought
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
online would increase the tax and then
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
um taxpayers do have the opportunity
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
even though we set the value they have
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to appeal it and so they
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
do appeal it and we reach an agreement
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
um that the value is less they have a
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
credit that's on file so the credit on
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
file can sometimes fluctuate the flow of
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
money um from month to
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
month so our low estimate for fiscal
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
year 25 of 44.3 million assumes that we
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
reach plan for the remainder of the year
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
and then the high assumes that we would
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
reach prior year revenue for the
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
remainder of the Year again very tight
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
44.3 million to 46.1 million and then a
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
pretty relatively low growth range of 0
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
to 3% in each of the next two years um
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
we I don't anticipate significant
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in the values of these
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
properties okay representative
 
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.670 align:start position:0%
properties okay representative
elme

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
elme
 
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.710 align:start position:0%
elme
yeah

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh this um the utility property Tex uh
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
has been benefiting from increases in uh
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
in green energy to use a word that some
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
people don't like uh and Trump is trying
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
to close it all down is this going to
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
have some
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
effect so the amount of taxable property
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
so whether there's new property coming
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
online or property that goes offline
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
would impact the tax um
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
but these estimates don't assume
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
significant fluctuations to that
 
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
extent representative
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
YY there's proposed legislation I know
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
you don't deal with proposed
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
legislation so we're going to ask you
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
about proposed
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
legisl uh that will um regarding energy
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
generators the generators yep yeah they
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
will not be paying the up but they will
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
be paying an increase rate if it's
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
shifted over to uh Statewide education
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
property taxes and uh swept is that
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
correct correct so that proposed
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
legislation would take um generators
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
utility generators out of paying the
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
utility property tax so let me back up
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
for a second what happens today is that
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
those utilities that pay this utility
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
property tax this Revenue goes 100% to
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so those
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
utilities do not pay the state wide
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
education property tax known as swept so
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
they don't contribute to the 363 million
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
that needs to be raised from swept
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
because they're paying into the
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as part of this
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
utility property tax the bill that
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative erer is ref referring to
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
would take electric generators or
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
utility generators out of the utility
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
property tax and
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
363.15 needs to be raised so that would
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
decrease the amount of the utility
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
property tax and that bill would be
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
reflected um on the Surplus statement so
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
you would still estimate it as if
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
they're paying it and then we work with
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
the LBA um with the fiscal note of the
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
impact to upt relative to removing the
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
generators and that would get included
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
statement thank
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
you okay okay thank you and then very
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
simply on the last page this just
 
01:06:59.829 --> 01:06:59.839 align:start position:0%
summarizes everything into one handy
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
dandy chart so you have our range for
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
25 and then the range of growth rates
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
for 26 and the range of growth rates for
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
27 so this just takes everything and
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
Place nice
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you m Mr chairman and
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
I had this question at the very
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
ask your blue stripes through here your
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
estimated 25 to 27 estimated
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
ranges taking your analysis your
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
Department's analysis of everything
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's been going on this past
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
year do you have these estimated Revenue
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
ranges start starting in 2016
 
01:08:01.589 --> 01:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
forward did your department make these
 
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
same analysis and the reason I'm asking
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
is I'd like to be able to look for what
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
you're doing now because it's
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
an turbulent time we're in all right in
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
in the economy I'd like to be able to
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
look back and see how close your
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
estimates were
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
to your crystal ball might be clearer
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
than our crystal ball okay uh I I I
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can do that or not I
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
know that representative opal asked
 
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
know that representative opal asked
about

01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
the what was
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
your uh liability and estimated payment
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
thing I know he asked about that and
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
then on your Revenue at the very end
 
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
then on your Revenue at the very end
your

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
chart would you be able to put that kind
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
of chart together for that same request
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
for 16 forward for those B those bium
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
years 16 17 18 19 20
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
21 I I don't know if that's too much
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
work but it it's like a baseball player
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
you know after so many years they start
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
to maybe their average is not good
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
enough or they're not for the team and
 
01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
you might want to look for I'm afraid no
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
no not you're going anywhere I'm just
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
trying to put this together so that we
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
might go oh that might be too high or
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
too low compared to what's happened in
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
the past sure yeah let me think about
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
the best I want to be able to present it
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
in a way that's easy to understand so
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll look at that and see what we
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
can do and then you'll
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
know how accurate our estimates
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
are R elme thank you I think that the D
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:09:49.199 --> 01:09:51.829 align:start position:0%
that the
uh

01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
l l lb AO sorry I'm I didn't get much
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
sleep last night um is um capable of
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
pulling that
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
together um every you've got this
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
information every single year going back
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
in your
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
records and it might make it
 
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
easier for us
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm happy I'm happy to do it I'm
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
only GNA do the years since I've been
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner though so I want you to
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a true reflection that's the
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
problem of Right For Better or
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
Worse oh but then we could see the worse
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
or the better right I don't want to
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
throw anybody else under the but Chris
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
did you have but but I just think to
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
represent am's Point yes we could help
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
with that we do have most of that
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
information I might need to get some of
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
the older years um that used to be paper
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
in our office and I'm not sure we have
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
it still
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
um but much of it's online as well on
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
our website and I think just one
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
clarification you're just looking for
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
the estimates that they provide when you
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
prepare the initial budget not any
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
revised estimates that come throughout
 
01:11:08.679 --> 01:11:10.310 align:start position:0%
revised estimates that come throughout
the

01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:13.149 --> 01:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
Bia that would make sense
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah could it could I bring up
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
something else oh yeah thank you on we
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
have the ability if we've got a computer
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
that will print it uh to print out
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
on these massive charts that we get
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
every uh every month at the end of the
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
month from
 
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
Dr about uh
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.159 --> 01:11:51.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
the the amount of money that came in the
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of money compared to the
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
prior year the amount of money that um
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
was refunded the amount of money and
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
estimates the uh all of the other things
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
um it might be interesting if um people
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been looking at that and I
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to print it out until
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
10 days ago are you talking about the
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
revenue Focus no not the revenue Focus
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
this this is a it comes to you every
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
month from the
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
Dr and it it um provides you every
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
single month of the
 
01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.149 align:start position:0%
single month of the
year

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
on past on and comparison to the prior
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
year okay and it it gives you all of
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
these different parts of of the picture
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
of where you end up right so it's it's
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
dr's month end reports we circulate
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
those very close to the last day of the
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
month it is the data essentially that
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
feeds into the revenue Focus much of
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
when I was quoting various comparisons
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
to Prior year in our conversation this
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
morning that's that's what I was looking
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
at is our month end report so I think um
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
it is a lot of data it's a lot there's a
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
lot going on there um I think you all
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
this morning hit on
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
the things that are probably most
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
important in those reports um those
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
reports are also summarized in some of
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
the other presentations I've given in
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
terms of business estimates extensions
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
returns um
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
so I think we've talked about a lot of
 
01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
what's in those reports but certainly
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to to dive deep with us um
 
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's more information in there and
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
and the problem with those reports is
 
01:13:58.270 --> 01:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
that there is no way to be able to read
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
them unless you uh have the ability to
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
do to either read them online or uh
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
print them on legal
 
01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
print them on legal
paper

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
and that that does limit the use of them
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
by most people because they'll just look
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
at this and say this is too much we
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
can't get through it on
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
online we don't have a way to printed
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
out my printer I didn't have a printer
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
for a whole month and a half this winter
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
are they formatted in legal you could
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
they're formatted so that you can print
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
them in legal yep the font gets small
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
just as we try to get as much
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
information yeah as possible so it's a
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
constant battle if you print them the
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
other way it uh you will need a
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
magnifying glass
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
usually getting smaller all the time
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
yeah uh or or you scroll well it depends
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
the type of computer I I with my fingers
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
I can expand it on my computer so but if
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
you can't yeah that would be uh
 
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative Spar thank you Mr chair
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
uh the this is very helpful with the
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates uh we haven't touched
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
on I just wanted to ask are we going to
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh Lottery insurance premium I think
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
there were a couple liquor fortunately
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
those are not not my fortunately or
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Dr doesn't collect those
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources so thank right and we
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
had uh Lottery and and so forth present
 
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
to us um and cruset has put that into I
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe those things are probably in
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
this worksheet we have now on our
 
01:15:34.719 --> 01:15:37.310 align:start position:0%
this worksheet we have now on our
desk

01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
desk
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative opal thank you Mr
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um commissioner this may be
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope this may be
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
overwhelming but it occurs to me that
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
and this may even address potentially
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
you've done I I think a very nice job in
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
terms of sort of pointing out with each
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
tax things that we need to consider I'm
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
wondering as you're putting together the
 
01:16:07.159 --> 01:16:09.030 align:start position:0%
wondering as you're putting together the
scorecard

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
scorecard
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
um you know to to stick with the
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
baseball analogy you know if a player is
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
injured one year his stats are going to
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
be down there are obviously factors that
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
impacted positively or negatively
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
whether a an estimate in two years in
 
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
advance was you know for example covid
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
is obviously the big one I'm just
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is some ability in a
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
macro sense sure to put some context
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
behind the numbers sure I I was thinking
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
of that exactly um as I was worried how
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
my scorecard was going to stack up um
 
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
there are a few things I think over the
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
time period that we'll want to highlight
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
one is the tax cut and jobs act in
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
2017 um the
 
01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
impact of covid um we very much revenue
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
estimates decreased um not just by Dr
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
but all the way through the legislature
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
significantly and then we outperformed
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
those because we didn't fortunately
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
didn't realize the impact that we
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
thought that we might see so we can
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
certainly footnote those sorts of things
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
for you um to increase my average
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
followup I mean just um you know as as
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
representative Erie said it might be an
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sort of take a look at
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
what our neighboring states were doing
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
with for example the tobacco tax sure
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner one more yes I would love
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
to have those
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
footnotes we'll do we'll do our best um
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
forget the effective tax cuts and jobs
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
act and things like that we'll do our
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
best with those footnotes I don't you
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
know we could probably put half a dozen
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
in every year which I think would
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
diminish the effectiveness of the
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
footnote and so we'll certainly but try
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
to hit the high points and certainly in
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
years when we did not perform close to
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
what the estimates were if we performed
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
quite well well to the estimates I might
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
welcome so just wanted to make sure the
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
members did see the worksheet I dropped
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
on your uh tables in front of you um I
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
also emailed that out to you last week
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
in PDF as as well as an Excel document
 
01:18:57.709 --> 01:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
so that if you wanted to have it on your
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
computer and make adjustments to it as
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
you were thinking about your Revenue
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
estimates you could do that um what you
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
don't have in there right now is what
 
01:19:06.629 --> 01:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
the commissioner just presented to you
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
today is the um basically the Dr related
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
revenues I didn't want to try to guess
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
that before I actually heard her speak
 
01:19:14.199 --> 01:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
that before I actually heard her speak
today

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
so but I will update that and if you
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
recall when I presented to you the first
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
day um when we talked about the
 
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
worksheet there'll be a page it will
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
take all those ranges and grow them and
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
show you you know what the high and the
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
low is in terms of the percentage so
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
you'll have numbers I'll take those
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
numbers and I'll plug them into the
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
worksheet so basically it just grows it
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
from year to year so if it's a the low
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
is at zero and the 26 and then zero and
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
27 it's going to stay the same you know
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
if there's a growth from 26 to 27
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
that'll be the growth in the low and
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
then I do the same for the High um so
 
01:19:54.709 --> 01:19:54.719 align:start position:0%
that the the range becomes a little bit
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
larger when you have do it that way um
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
this is done this way because several
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
years ago um our office used to do an
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
average of those ranges um and the
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
committee decided that it didn't want
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
that anymore that it wanted the the
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
range to be able to work in between in
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh month-end reports I can
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
forward the email that you would have
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
all received from Dr when I get back to
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
the office so that you would get that
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
right now or essentially today so you
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
could see the reports that are being
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
talked about and as the commissioner at
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
um some of the responses to the
 
01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions today she was using some of
 
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
those month-end reports which go back
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
several years and some instances and
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's on a month-to month comparison um
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
and in where it's appropriate I can try
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
to actually print some of those on the
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
legal page for you and bring it back at
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
lunch uh in the afternoon so that you
 
01:20:44.159 --> 01:20:45.149 align:start position:0%
lunch uh in the afternoon so that you
have

01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
that um so if there's any other
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns or issues that you
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
guys might have let me know and and
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
we'll try try to address that so will
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
you have a um Consolidated uh you'll
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
have something to give us tomorrow
 
01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
morning for Dr I will I will I'll update
 
01:21:09.149 --> 01:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
um unless for some crazy reason I can
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
get it done at the lunch hour um but if
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
I can update it before I come back at
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
one I will if not I'll have it done by
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and I'll email it out
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
again for you to have tonight so when
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
you come back in the morning you'll have
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
the um the latest and greatest B Bas on
 
01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
what you heard today um can we get a
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
print out as well yes for tomorrow yep
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
yep I always come with a print out but I
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
will always send it electronically
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
because there's a combination of what
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
people like to do with it yeah perfect
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Chris uh yes represent El me
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't remember ever having
 
01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
the draft Capper come out this late is
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of how much
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
variation there may be from so what that
 
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
says we don't expect a lot of variation
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
from what you see in this report I just
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
noted it in case there is any slight
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments before the final um the
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
extension was through the end of March
 
01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
so the report should be almost
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
finalized um but the biggest reason for
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
giving you the information is the liquor
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
number from the cash at the end of the
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
year to what you see in the Acer and
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
what they presented to you was slightly
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
different it was about a uh 15 to2
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
million adjustment um and it had to do
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
with some of the
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
um shifting from their old computer
 
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
system to their new computer system and
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
reconciling some of the the numbers
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
related to that um so I didn't want you
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
to be using a higher number if you were
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
at wow and it takes that long
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
to just fix that one section well
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
they're auditing The Liquor Commission
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
and and they need to reconciled and make
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
sure that the numbers that they're
 
01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
looking at are truly the numbers that
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
should be reconciled so there's a a
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
growth or learning that's occurring with
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
the Auditors with the agency and
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that um the migration from
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
the old system to the new system and how
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
those two interacted and what they
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
should be seen as a result of that
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
migration so that's taken a little
 
01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
longer than expected um some of the
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
reports that the Auditors typically get
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process didn't come until
 
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
much later um and and then they're
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what those reports
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
are and if they contain the accurate
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
information so that that's what some of
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
portion

01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
portion
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
thanks anyone have any questions for
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
Chris okay seeing none thank you Chris
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I think we're coming back at 1:00 to
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
maybe do do some of the easier pieces of
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue estimating that would be the
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
plan uh we'll come back at 1:00 and
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do some of the easier ones uh
 
01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll definitely have to spend
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
more time on business taxes and things
 
01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.270 align:start position:0%
more time on business taxes and things
like

01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
that okay all right so um that's that's
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much it for this morning um we'll
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
come back at one o'clock and start doing
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
a work session on this stuff thank you
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
for the Democrats present it's the
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
Webster room and I don't know whether we
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
or

01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I was bullied into bringing my
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
lunch which makes it pretty difficult
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
could all the Republicans stay in this
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
choice how many do we have one
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
two three four five why would you do
 
01:25:18.510 --> 01:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
that six
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
seven nine yeah there's nine of us here
 
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:53.229 align:start position:0%
seven nine yeah there's nine of us here
yes

01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%

we will get started on our uh and now
 
03:05:24.990 --> 03:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
that we've heard from all all the
 
03:05:27.070 --> 03:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
agencies we've heard from Dr we've heard
 
03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
from liquor
 
03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
Lottery and so forth um and as Chris
 
03:05:34.229 --> 03:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned this morning we have these
 
03:05:37.389 --> 03:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
worksheets in front of us which uh deal
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
with all the other agencies we've heard
 
03:05:42.309 --> 03:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
from except Dr which that'll be
 
03:05:44.469 --> 03:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
integrated in for tomorrow's uh
 
03:05:44.479 --> 03:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
integrated in for tomorrow's uh
tomorrow's

03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's
 
03:05:49.190 --> 03:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
session um tomorrow's meeting I should
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
say so
 
03:05:54.510 --> 03:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
um before we um before we get started
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these I just wanted
 
03:05:58.510 --> 03:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
to go around a little bit and see if
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
people have just you know in general
 
03:06:03.550 --> 03:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts on where they think uh the
 
03:06:06.429 --> 03:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
economy uh is headed over the next uh
 
03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
year or two uh because ultimately when
 
03:06:11.190 --> 03:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
we look at all these
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
revenues um we have to decide on high
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
range low range or May maybe out of
 
03:06:21.070 --> 03:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
range maybe something different um and
 
03:06:23.269 --> 03:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
and as we do that we not only look at
 
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
you know what's happening uh for example
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
the um uh tobacco tax we know less
 
03:06:30.429 --> 03:06:30.439 align:start position:0%
people are smoking that's not
 
03:06:34.389 --> 03:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily an economic uh issue U but
 
03:06:37.110 --> 03:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
so I just want to go around um not I
 
03:06:37.990 --> 03:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
mean if you don't want to speak you
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to just kind of anyone who's
 
03:06:41.630 --> 03:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
interested wants to just say what their
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts on on the economy next year or
 
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
two are U I'm going to start with that
 
03:06:49.830 --> 03:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
so I'll start uh over here on sir's surl
 
03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
do you want to say something uh sure so
 
03:06:56.349 --> 03:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
I mean from what we're seeing already I
 
03:06:59.150 --> 03:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's a different
 
03:07:02.309 --> 03:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
Administration uh there's we're already
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
seeing uh things
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
stabilize uh businesses are reporting
 
03:07:10.229 --> 03:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
where they couldn't decide what was
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
going to happen from quarter to quarter
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'm now I've read articles where
 
03:07:19.510 --> 03:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
businesses have a an Outlook of
 
03:07:22.630 --> 03:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
stability so I I think we're going to
 
03:07:25.770 --> 03:07:25.780 align:start position:0%
see the uh nation's economy
 
03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:26.950 align:start position:0%
see the uh nation's economy
[Music]

03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
improve I think by uh the current
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
administration's push for energy we're
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
going to see Energy prices
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
decline and I believe once we see the
 
03:07:43.710 --> 03:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
energy prices uh declining which I'm
 
03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
already seeing that where I buy gas it's
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
come down about cents a
 
03:07:51.990 --> 03:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
gallon I think we're going to see that
 
03:07:55.790 --> 03:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh everything is driven by energy so
 
03:07:58.830 --> 03:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to see our grocery prices
 
03:08:03.150 --> 03:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
decline uh fuel for the heating of our
 
03:08:06.190 --> 03:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
homes Decline and if we're drilling I
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
mean if we start exporting we're already
 
03:08:11.830 --> 03:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
exporting energy but if we start
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
exporting a lot more energy as I would
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
guess it it will it's going to happen
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
happen just like it was four years ago
 
03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
then uh I I really think uh the economy
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
is in for a real good shot in the arm I
 
03:08:28.110 --> 03:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see great things I
 
03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see the interest
 
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
rates come
 
03:08:34.990 --> 03:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
down and uh I'm very optimistic about
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
the next couple years I think we're
 
03:08:41.190 --> 03:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
going to see sometime by Midsummer we're
 
03:08:43.469 --> 03:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
going to see uh fuel prices down
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
interest rates down that's why I was
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
asking Lindsay about what the uh impact
 
03:08:51.150 --> 03:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
could be on the Housing Industry but I I
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see those rates
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
coming down very soon
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Murphy did you want
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
to add anything um yes I think uh the
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
tax reform I think will end
 
03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
up getting you know it's going to end up
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
passing at the federal level and that's
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
going to put more money back in the
 
03:09:13.469 --> 03:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
hands of the small business owner and
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
also I think the average American so
 
03:09:18.030 --> 03:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
that may help our tourism industry which
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hoping so hopefully those um
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
meals and and uh other taxes will
 
03:09:26.229 --> 03:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
benefit from that okay thank you
 
03:09:26.239 --> 03:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
benefit from that okay thank you
representative

03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
Spar uh I worry about the debt load of
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
this country I think it's stifling our
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
economy and uh will continue to be a
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
problem with GDP I I do read The Wall
 
03:09:39.070 --> 03:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
Street Journal and uh I'm concerned with
 
03:09:41.550 --> 03:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know a number of uh foreign
 
03:09:44.349 --> 03:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
countries that are substantially uh uh
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
you know underwater and uh I guess the
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
last risk I feel is what's happening
 
03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
down in Washington and and how that
 
03:09:52.389 --> 03:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
interacts also internationally and does
 
03:09:53.950 --> 03:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
that put a lot of risk into the equation
 
03:09:55.349 --> 03:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
of what happens with our economy and I
 
03:09:59.229 --> 03:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
think it does okay president
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
shamber Mr chairman my thoughts upon
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
this byian budget coming up and what are
 
03:10:07.790 --> 03:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
we've heard so far is the reason I asked
 
03:10:10.910 --> 03:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
I wanted to see I think we've had a lot
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
of Revenue come into the state that was
 
03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
of Revenue come into the state that was
not

03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:10:19.150 --> 03:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
particularly driven by are economic
 
03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
engines uh
 
03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we're high in our approach
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
to this I think we should be a little
 
03:10:32.309 --> 03:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
bit concerned about all the new things
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative spars talked
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
about Economic Policy coming out of
 
03:10:37.120 --> 03:10:38.070 align:start position:0%
about Economic Policy coming out of
Washington

03:10:38.070 --> 03:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
03:10:38.080 --> 03:10:41.190 align:start position:0%
Washington
DC

03:10:41.190 --> 03:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.750 --> 03:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that we should look at a a
 
03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
lower number on a lot of these
 
03:10:51.389 --> 03:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
opal uh it probably will come as no
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
surprise that I um respectfully disagree
 
03:10:59.710 --> 03:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
with most of what representative or said
 
03:11:04.510 --> 03:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
um I think in fact the threat of tariffs
 
03:11:07.950 --> 03:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
will has and will continue to
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
destabilize uh business I think we heard
 
03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
from um both commissioner Carswell and
 
03:11:18.510 --> 03:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
others who said that tariff would have a
 
03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
dramatic uh substantial impact on New
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy in particular Canada
 
03:11:27.550 --> 03:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
is our largest trading partner um and it
 
03:11:30.429 --> 03:11:30.439 align:start position:0%
and it could have I believe the word he
 
03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
used was devastating impact um I think
 
03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
that is that is at
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
best um an open question and I don't
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
know that we have uh any real answer on
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
that and so as far as that continues to
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
be a
 
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
sort of damle hanging over us I'm not
 
03:11:54.030 --> 03:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we can do anything other than
 
03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
um look at all of these
 
03:12:00.429 --> 03:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
revenues um with the strictest possible
 
03:12:05.670 --> 03:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
um approach thank you representative
 
03:12:08.190 --> 03:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
Malloy thank
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
you uh I think what's been said and
 
03:12:13.389 --> 03:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
probably what's going to be said is
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:12:19.550 --> 03:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
cover uh what you're overall question is
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
um but my
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh concern for New Hampshire is
 
03:12:29.950 --> 03:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
housing and the ability to
 
03:12:33.790 --> 03:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh keep and retain workers I think
 
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the drag
 
03:12:38.429 --> 03:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
on if there is a drag on business right
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
now that's what's going to continue here
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what I focus on and I hear
 
03:12:44.590 --> 03:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
that I live in
 
03:12:46.830 --> 03:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh one of the most expensive housing
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
commun unities in the United States near
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Greenland and Rockingham
 
03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:59.550 --> 03:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
hear cost of housing and I hear that
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
from uh people who
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
are have a generation coming up behind
 
03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
them their children their kids their
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
grandkids uh and that just
 
03:13:15.630 --> 03:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
puts a damper on a lot of things even
 
03:13:17.229 --> 03:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
though a lot of other things are going
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
well but that's my uh that's my focus
 
03:13:23.269 --> 03:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you I'm hoping that we can
 
03:13:33.269 --> 03:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
discuss all of this through at least the
 
03:13:36.790 --> 03:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
lenses of our own realism uh rather than
 
03:13:39.309 --> 03:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
as a political
 
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
statement but I'm finding it extremely
 
03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:45.710 align:start position:0%
statement but I'm finding it extremely
difficult

03:13:45.710 --> 03:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
03:13:47.790 --> 03:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
to guess
 
03:13:51.990 --> 03:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
how much longer the chaos in Washington
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
is going to be there and what is coming
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh and aside from the Tariff war wars
 
03:14:05.630 --> 03:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
which we seem to be extremely close to
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
now from Trump's
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
statements um which would be disastrous
 
03:14:15.070 --> 03:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
for everybody in the world including us
 
03:14:20.710 --> 03:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm really worried about what
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
Elon Musk is doing to tear away the
 
03:14:28.110 --> 03:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the financial records
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
of a lot of the um
 
03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
highest earning and uh on largest
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
corporations and as well as the smaller
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
businesses um he's going in there and
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
getting control of their financial data
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
he himself is a heavy Financial operator
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
and I think an awful lot of people must
 
03:14:59.950 --> 03:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
be very nervous at this point about
 
03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
competition and their ability to
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
survive thank you representative
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
y thank
 
03:15:12.269 --> 03:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
you want to trying not to be political
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I won't say too much about Elon Musk
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
as doing his
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh limited legal
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
analysis of various agencies which is
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't taken place that
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
being said the Tariff issue I'm kind of
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
reminded of what happened when tariffs
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
were placed on uh European wines mostly
 
03:15:39.550 --> 03:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
Italian and
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:48.110 --> 03:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
off France I excuse me California New
 
03:15:51.110 --> 03:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
York wines became very popular and we
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
even have wineries in New
 
03:15:57.150 --> 03:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire interesting how that
 
03:15:59.189 --> 03:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
works I'm
 
03:16:02.269 --> 03:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
also not very concerned about the Tariff
 
03:16:02.279 --> 03:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
also not very concerned about the Tariff
Wars

03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
Wars
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
because nobody wants to have them so
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
people are willing to take a look at
 
03:16:09.510 --> 03:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
their own
 
03:16:12.670 --> 03:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
practices and work with their other
 
03:16:12.680 --> 03:16:13.910 align:start position:0%
practices and work with their other
trading

03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
trading
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
partners I think that uh has already
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
been shown by various uh actions uh most
 
03:16:24.830 --> 03:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
immediately by Mexico and by
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh um Canada and uh even some of the
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
South American countries regarding the
 
03:16:35.150 --> 03:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
repatriation of immigrants but that's
 
03:16:37.189 --> 03:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
into the political
 
03:16:39.710 --> 03:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
realm within the United
 
03:16:42.030 --> 03:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
States the
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
current uh situation
 
03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
of too much money being on the mark the
 
03:16:53.389 --> 03:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
M2 number is huge and being so large
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult
 
03:17:01.110 --> 03:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
for there to be a real accounting as to
 
03:17:03.309 --> 03:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
03:17:07.110 --> 03:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
eggs uh some of the uh fraud and
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
deception that has recently been
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
reported including the unwarranted
 
03:17:14.590 --> 03:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
destruction of millions of uh chickens
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
laying chickens um
 
03:17:22.309 --> 03:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
for no reason other than the director
 
03:17:22.319 --> 03:17:23.389 align:start position:0%
for no reason other than the director
ordered

03:17:23.389 --> 03:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
ordered
 
03:17:26.070 --> 03:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
him uh
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
destroyed uh you begin to wonder if
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's some mations taking place that
 
03:17:35.309 --> 03:17:35.319 align:start position:0%
could cause
 
03:17:38.710 --> 03:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
damage but within the first quarter I
 
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see a lowering of
 
03:17:44.189 --> 03:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
returns but after the first quarter I
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
tend to agree with uh representative ORS
 
03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
that when the uh spring Market comes in
 
03:17:55.830 --> 03:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
and we get rid of this white stuff
 
03:17:57.830 --> 03:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's complicating
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
travel we should probably see an
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
increase I'm I'm
 
03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
optimistic cautiously
 
03:18:10.429 --> 03:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
optimistic thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:18:10.439 --> 03:18:11.710 align:start position:0%
optimistic thank you Mr chair thank you
representative

03:18:11.710 --> 03:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:14.189 --> 03:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
om yeah thank you Mr chairman like
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative Spar I tend to look at
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
the financial press and think about some
 
03:18:19.389 --> 03:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
of the macro issues that are affecting
 
03:18:19.399 --> 03:18:20.229 align:start position:0%
of the macro issues that are affecting
the

03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:18:23.229 --> 03:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
economy and the ones I'm concerned about
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
are primarily the federal deficit we've
 
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
added $8 trillion do to the deficit that
 
03:18:30.670 --> 03:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
affects us directly with interest rates
 
03:18:33.469 --> 03:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
and interest rates directly affect our
 
03:18:36.550 --> 03:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
housing situation with mortgage rates
 
03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:37.590 align:start position:0%
housing situation with mortgage rates
around

03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:18:41.950 --> 03:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
7% uh people are not getting
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
the uh turnover and housing that we
 
03:18:47.309 --> 03:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
would have expected which affects our
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
EST State transfer taxes the data I have
 
03:18:51.389 --> 03:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
says that you need to get the rates down
 
03:18:54.469 --> 03:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
to about 5 and a half% to uh get into a
 
03:18:55.750 --> 03:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
normal supply and demand of the
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
marketplace that's when people will give
 
03:18:59.429 --> 03:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
up a mortgage and look at moving into
 
03:18:59.439 --> 03:19:00.710 align:start position:0%
up a mortgage and look at moving into
another

03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:19:04.750 --> 03:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
place so I don't see the federal deficit
 
03:19:06.630 --> 03:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
coming down much in the next couple of
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
years probably still in a trillion to
 
03:19:10.910 --> 03:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
two trillion dollar range which I think
 
03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
will keep interest rates high and keep
 
03:19:17.710 --> 03:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
treasuries you know closer to 5% 10year
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
yields and until that drops about half a
 
03:19:21.349 --> 03:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
point or more I don't think we're going
 
03:19:22.189 --> 03:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
to see
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
much effect onto our housing prices in
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
the housing
 
03:19:30.229 --> 03:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
revenue on oil prices uh the notes I
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
have here say it looks like 75 to $80 a
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
barrel for the next uh period despite
 
03:19:38.590 --> 03:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's going to be more
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
drilling going on and more sources of
 
03:19:44.349 --> 03:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
energy um so I hope that's going to
 
03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
bring prices down a bit but the big un
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
known of course as the geopolitical
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
risks and that we thrown much control
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
over so I tend to be a little bit on the
 
03:19:56.590 --> 03:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
cost side uh the forecast that Kiplinger
 
03:20:00.950 --> 03:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
has for next year is is basically 2.5%
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
GDP growth up from which is down from
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
2.8% this year and I'm kind of inclined
 
03:20:10.269 --> 03:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
to say the unless I could see other
 
03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
Trends I'm looking at a flat growth for
 
03:20:16.830 --> 03:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
the economy in in nashille thank you Mr
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no Hampshire thank you Mr
 
03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative boltim
 
03:20:22.510 --> 03:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
but tell us what about Nashville no um
 
03:20:25.269 --> 03:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
so yeah it looks like uh we're probably
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know get maybe a 1.6 two point U
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
bump next year but also they're talking
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
about a contraction the year after so um
 
03:20:34.750 --> 03:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're in for a great ride
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
um as far as n Hampshire I'll defer to
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
our ranking but with all the court cases
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
kicking around uh YDC education Men's
 
03:20:48.790 --> 03:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
prison uh that's not a court case um
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be kind of a rough ride to
 
03:20:52.830 --> 03:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
try to you know backfill all that that
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
cost that's coming down the pike and
 
03:20:59.229 --> 03:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
also housing is critical education is
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
still pretty much up in the air um as
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
far as like funding and um whether or
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
not vouchers rule um and I think the you
 
03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
know the costs the interest rates are
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
such that it's going to be a rough ride
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
for many people people that are kind of
 
03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
in limbo trying to look for a job in a
 
03:21:21.150 --> 03:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
house for the next couple
 
03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
years thank you thank you representative
 
03:21:29.070 --> 03:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
sodi yeah um I'm uh optimistic uh New
 
03:21:30.830 --> 03:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a small state that's pretty
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
well-run and I think we're affected at
 
03:21:35.429 --> 03:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
the federal level more than anything
 
03:21:39.070 --> 03:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
else and I think it looks like um Trump
 
03:21:40.590 --> 03:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh this time around might have taken
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
some inspiration from uh Javier Malay
 
03:21:45.990 --> 03:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the aera and getting rid of the
 
03:21:48.750 --> 03:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse and I think that's only
 
03:21:49.950 --> 03:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
going to be good for our debt and only
 
03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
going to be good for our country so let
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
the aaring
 
03:21:56.590 --> 03:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
continue representative
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
Ford I'm um cautiously
 
03:22:02.910 --> 03:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
optimistic um I am concerned about the
 
03:22:05.070 --> 03:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
national debt it has has worried me for
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
years and it seems like it's only
 
03:22:08.910 --> 03:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
increasing and that's why the reduction
 
03:22:11.110 --> 03:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the federal Workforce is important to
 
03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
me um um I I see the tariffs as a
 
03:22:17.550 --> 03:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
negotiating tool at this point I don't
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
know how much will become a reality but
 
03:22:23.550 --> 03:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
um I would I would like to think that
 
03:22:26.110 --> 03:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
the first quarter because of the transs
 
03:22:27.870 --> 03:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh because of the administration
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
administrative change it might be a
 
03:22:31.510 --> 03:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
little rocky but I think it will
 
03:22:34.189 --> 03:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
increase by quarters two three and four
 
03:22:34.199 --> 03:22:36.269 align:start position:0%
increase by quarters two three and four
thank

03:22:36.269 --> 03:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:22:41.070 --> 03:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
Brier I'm more pessimistic than all of
 
03:22:43.870 --> 03:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:48.750 --> 03:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
sorry yes eventually like uh sirel said
 
03:22:50.349 --> 03:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
the economy will be getting better I
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't apologize fast let me just
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
apologize representative tyy okay I I
 
03:22:55.950 --> 03:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be anywhere as
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
near as fast um it may take place in uh
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
the first quarter of the next federal
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year but I don't think it's
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
coming anywhere sooner than that uh the
 
03:23:10.830 --> 03:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
debt is one thing that's holding it way
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
way back and the only way you're going
 
03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
to get the debt under control is you
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't spend more than you take in and I
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't see that happening anytime soon
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.389 --> 03:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
control thank you now representative
 
03:23:30.399 --> 03:23:32.150 align:start position:0%
control thank you now representative
Brier

03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
Brier
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh what I know is the
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
more fuel inventory you have if they're
 
03:23:40.070 --> 03:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to do more actually produce more
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
crude more oil uh as your inventory gets
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
larger the prices will come down and the
 
03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
oil price do tie tie into uh you know
 
03:23:51.150 --> 03:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
because every every product you have has
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
to go to market so as the cost of
 
03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
Transportation so I agree with that
 
03:23:59.790 --> 03:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
comment uh as far as interest rates I
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be some play with
 
03:24:02.950 --> 03:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
the interest rates but not enough
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily I think I think New
 
03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is still going to have a
 
03:24:08.550 --> 03:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
housing crisis for the next two years I
 
03:24:09.950 --> 03:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to get resolved
 
03:24:15.070 --> 03:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
anytime soon um I'd be uh like it's
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
already been said I'd be very cautious
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
on uh what to expect cuz I I would I
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't think there's going to be a lot of
 
03:24:25.630 --> 03:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
play in the revenue um and I I do know
 
03:24:27.389 --> 03:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
that I used to be on the other side of
 
03:24:30.309 --> 03:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
the table providing estimates and I know
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
that a lot of thought goes in by the
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
agencies when they're coming up with
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
their estimates and uh I will say that
 
03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
they are the experts and I I think we
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
should trust them with the estimates and
 
03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's just my two cents thank you it's
 
03:24:46.830 --> 03:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's a that's a good perspective Ive
 
03:24:50.269 --> 03:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
from from the other side of the table
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I guess I um my thought is that
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm optimistic for the longer term I
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
think um as we look at the next year um
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
even even if we're you know in a more
 
03:25:06.110 --> 03:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
positive uh thought process uh it's not
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to happen immediately I think the
 
03:25:11.830 --> 03:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
probably for the next year it's uh we
 
03:25:13.229 --> 03:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
may see a little bit of change but I
 
03:25:15.790 --> 03:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be fairly flat uh
 
03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
and and with some potential upside for
 
03:25:20.990 --> 03:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
2027 but I agree with the statements
 
03:25:24.630 --> 03:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
about the debt uh being awful large I
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
think it's the debt is close to one
 
03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
trillion now per year which which report
 
03:25:31.510 --> 03:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
I heard the other day is now larger than
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
the defense budget so that's that's just
 
03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
really bad the debt needs to get under
 
03:25:37.710 --> 03:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
control and that's going to stifle
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
economic growth for the country and thus
 
03:25:43.990 --> 03:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire to some degree so
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I think we need to be uh
 
03:25:49.750 --> 03:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
cautiously um
 
03:25:53.030 --> 03:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
optimistic thank you okay now let's take
 
03:25:56.229 --> 03:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
a look at uh what crochet has put
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
together for us um the first part of
 
03:26:00.990 --> 03:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
this is the general and education trust
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
fund work sheets which includes as you
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
can see across the top business taxes
 
03:26:10.990 --> 03:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
um so Chris when you when you have
 
03:26:14.110 --> 03:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
business taxes you have you combined
 
03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
um bet and B PT there yeah they are
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
reported as a single number to the
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
committee you make your estimate based
 
03:26:23.830 --> 03:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
on that okay um as the committee may
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
have real uh seen in the revenue Focus
 
03:26:29.189 --> 03:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
um for the last I think since August
 
03:26:31.229 --> 03:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
time frame the business taxes have been
 
03:26:33.150 --> 03:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
shown as a combined number because there
 
03:26:35.309 --> 03:26:35.319 align:start position:0%
was so much interaction between the BET
 
03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
and BPT so some of the numbers were in
 
03:26:39.590 --> 03:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
the BET were looking way off and was
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
causing a lot of confusion but your
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
overall number was okay and there was a
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
couple of reasons for that um waiting to
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
see what what the governor does in terms
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
of um how she presents her her business
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
taxes if it'll be in a single line as
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
well okay so how have we done it in the
 
03:26:57.309 --> 03:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
past have we reported we've split it
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
we've split it and that's that's what
 
03:27:01.189 --> 03:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
caused some of the problems this last by
 
03:27:03.269 --> 03:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
Anum is that we make the estimate we
 
03:27:05.550 --> 03:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
used was too low on the BET or too high
 
03:27:08.030 --> 03:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
on the BET side and so it looks like the
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
BET wasn't generating the revenue it
 
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
needed to but it had to do with um the
 
03:27:15.309 --> 03:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
split between the BPT and the BET was
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
incorrect when we projected it okay
 
03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
represent Aly yes uh we were going and
 
03:27:27.950 --> 03:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
despite my protests uh with 60 40%
 
03:27:31.189 --> 03:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
roughly uh splits for quite a long time
 
03:27:33.670 --> 03:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
and as the economy has progressed so
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
that it is mostly profits that are
 
03:27:41.389 --> 03:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
growing rather than imp uh cost of
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
employment um we down to um 20
 
03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
27% bet is it well she she reported
 
03:27:55.269 --> 03:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
78.3% BPT and 21.7 bet yeah and and it
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
fluctuates a little bit um in in that 70
 
03:27:58.160 --> 03:27:59.189 align:start position:0%
fluctuates a little bit um in in that 70
to

03:27:59.189 --> 03:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:28:02.910 --> 03:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
73% uh BPT presumably that could
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
fluctuate again back do we have are you
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
expecting to have to to increase the
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
difference between the two or stabilize
 
03:28:18.710 --> 03:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
or I I don't believe they think it's
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to be shifting back as much um
 
03:28:24.189 --> 03:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
again you referenced the 6040 split that
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
has been traditionally been used um that
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
was a number that was kind of Applied
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
prior to the rim system being put into
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
place and some of the data that they can
 
03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
now see so the Department of Revenue
 
03:28:37.950 --> 03:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
Administration can um see when you pay
 
03:28:41.469 --> 03:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
your the rate payer pays that the prior
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
year X percentage was BPT X percentage
 
03:28:46.269 --> 03:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
was bet and they're applying it to those
 
03:28:49.269 --> 03:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
buckets now whereas before if a rate
 
03:28:52.750 --> 03:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
payer said oh it's 5050 they would apply
 
03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
it 5050 or if they said it was 100% bet
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
and no BPT they would apply it that way
 
03:28:58.870 --> 03:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so there was adjustments throughout
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
the year now that they see the real
 
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
number um they they know it's not 6040
 
03:29:06.429 --> 03:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
been uh since the end of last year
 
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
you've been seeing the 70 70 to 73% of
 
03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
BPT and and the balance being the BET
 
03:29:16.349 --> 03:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
and again why you saw a lot of
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments in those numbers and why the
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
the decision was made um with Dr and
 
03:29:22.630 --> 03:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
administrative services to start
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
reporting it as just as a single
 
03:29:26.070 --> 03:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
business tax number that's how you
 
03:29:27.790 --> 03:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
estimate it in this room that's how they
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
provide the information when they come
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
in that's how they provide it when they
 
03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
work with the governor um if you ever
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
needed to see the information behind
 
03:29:37.550 --> 03:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's always there but in terms of
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
minimizing confusion going forward the
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
thought was just having a single
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.830 --> 03:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
asking what are the numbers that you
 
03:29:51.189 --> 03:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:51.199 --> 03:29:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
sheet

03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
03:29:52.720 --> 03:29:59.469 align:start position:0%
sheet
she

03:29:59.469 --> 03:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.349 --> 03:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
presented yeah right so if if you look
 
03:30:04.070 --> 03:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
at the if you want to turn to page three
 
03:30:05.189 --> 03:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
I'll just walk you through the
 
03:30:06.750 --> 03:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so everybody's on the same
 
03:30:06.760 --> 03:30:08.030 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so everybody's on the same
page

03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's your general education
 
03:30:13.110 --> 03:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund um Revenue sources that that
 
03:30:15.189 --> 03:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
you'll be looking at in the in the first
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
one under column as your business taxes
 
03:30:20.750 --> 03:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
followed by meals and rooms Etc um Row 1
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
through four would be fiscal year
 
03:30:27.150 --> 03:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
2024 row two is the official plan so I
 
03:30:28.590 --> 03:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
think as we discussed at the beginning
 
03:30:31.269 --> 03:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
that um at The Once A legislature passes
 
03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
a budget and signed in law by the
 
03:30:35.150 --> 03:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
governor Department of administrative
 
03:30:37.469 --> 03:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
Services takes all the adjustments of
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
the estimates that were contained in
 
03:30:40.389 --> 03:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
house bill one and anything that was
 
03:30:42.269 --> 03:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
adjusted through House Bill 2 due to
 
03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and they figure out what is
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the net number of reeven for the
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
revenue amount for each of the revenue
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
sources and then they come up with a
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
revenue monthly plan so what you're
 
03:30:55.670 --> 03:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
seeing is the official plan for the year
 
03:30:58.510 --> 03:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
so for on the business taxes it was 1.24
 
03:31:03.389 --> 03:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
s um the draft ACA as was uh noted
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
earlier it's later than usual usually
 
03:31:07.870 --> 03:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's due by 12:31 but due to some uh
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
unforeseen circumstances in terms of the
 
03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh transition with Liquor's um computer
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
system it's taking a little bit longer
 
03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
to get that ful F audited so they're
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
delayed but we were able to provide you
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
with a you know an as of 129 number for
 
03:31:23.550 --> 03:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
revenues that you should see when the
 
03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
ACT comes out at the end of the
 
03:31:29.229 --> 03:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
month um so uh the annual comprehensive
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
financial report I'm
 
03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
sorry so that's the annual audit that's
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
done on the state finances and and in
 
03:31:38.790 --> 03:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
that um you get to see the for all the
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
different funds and and um activities
 
03:31:43.990 --> 03:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that occur you'll see the comments in
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
terms of their uh expenses and and where
 
03:31:48.990 --> 03:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
they sit in terms of balances and and
 
03:31:51.429 --> 03:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
surpluses or
 
03:31:51.439 --> 03:31:53.389 align:start position:0%
surpluses or
deficits

03:31:53.389 --> 03:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
deficits
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
um okay represent
 
03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
Aly yeah
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
on it does say this on the first sheet
 
03:32:03.870 --> 03:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
but uh people don't usually stay on this
 
03:32:07.590 --> 03:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
first sheet very often this is millions
 
03:32:07.600 --> 03:32:09.229 align:start position:0%
first sheet very often this is millions
yes

03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:32:11.349 --> 03:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
yes so it's
 
03:32:17.150 --> 03:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
1.24 s billion uh that was the official
 
03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
plan yes y thank you but also the
 
03:32:28.110 --> 03:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
um we do have to deal with somebody has
 
03:32:30.790 --> 03:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to split where the
 
03:32:33.309 --> 03:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
money goes between the general fund and
 
03:32:35.790 --> 03:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund that somebody
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
might be
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
me yeah all by yourself yeah uh well no
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
I it we'll see it when the governor's
 
03:32:43.710 --> 03:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
budget comes out we have an idea what
 
03:32:46.429 --> 03:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
the splits are um in terms terms of you
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
know some of these taxes so for instance
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
like tobacco if you want to just to talk
 
03:32:53.070 --> 03:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
about that we know that with the
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes it's $1.78 a pack the first
 
03:32:57.389 --> 03:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
dollar goes to the general fund anything
 
03:32:58.830 --> 03:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
above a dollar goes to the education
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
trust fund we also know that all the
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
other other than um the OTP other
 
03:33:07.469 --> 03:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
tobacco products and all the ecigarettes
 
03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
all goes to the general fund so I need
 
03:33:12.870 --> 03:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
to I know that based on today's
 
03:33:16.429 --> 03:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
presentation it was at 17% is the OTP
 
03:33:18.510 --> 03:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
amount so I would know that that that
 
03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be going to the general fund and I
 
03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
have a spreadsheet that I would use to
 
03:33:24.030 --> 03:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
do that you would see all this your
 
03:33:26.910 --> 03:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
final worksheet will have all the splits
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
so you'll see that and you'll know what
 
03:33:30.670 --> 03:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund amount is
 
03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
you'll know what the general fund amount
 
03:33:34.510 --> 03:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
is I know that the business taxes will
 
03:33:36.910 --> 03:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
be split 41% to the education trust fund
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
59% to the general fund I know that the
 
03:33:43.189 --> 03:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
real estate TR uh transfer tax is split
 
03:33:45.910 --> 03:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
um 2/3 to the general fund 1/3 to the AG
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
ation trust fund
 
03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
have I think that's it so I think we
 
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
covered them um follow up could I uh
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
somebody asked me on is the governor
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
talking with the
 
03:34:13.349 --> 03:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
LBA no about these things no so we don't
 
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
know until Thurs stay whether she's uh
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
using older data or so she works with
 
03:34:24.590 --> 03:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
the agencies throughout the process okay
 
03:34:27.550 --> 03:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
and so she's going to have um access to
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
the same types of information that
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
you've been hearing from the agencies
 
03:34:34.830 --> 03:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
the last two weeks um but not the split
 
03:34:36.429 --> 03:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
um oh she would have that as well the
 
03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
Departments would help Lindsay's group
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
would do that yeah y thank you
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
yep yeah so so the first four lines on
 
03:34:48.870 --> 03:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
that first page page three is just just
 
03:34:51.070 --> 03:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
to give you what fiscal year 24 the
 
03:34:54.349 --> 03:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
activity looked like um fiscal year 25s
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
gives you gives you the official plan on
 
03:34:59.790 --> 03:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
row eight and then for rows nine and 10
 
03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
we do the agency high
 
03:35:05.189 --> 03:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
low most agencies it's just a single
 
03:35:06.510 --> 03:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
number that they've provided you the
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
high low comes into play with the Dr
 
03:35:10.590 --> 03:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
numbers where they give you their range
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what we plug in here so
 
03:35:13.750 --> 03:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when you see this spreadsheet
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
for business taxes you'll see a low
 
03:35:17.110 --> 03:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
number and a high number based on what
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
was presented today by the
 
03:35:21.630 --> 03:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner um and then that's the same
 
03:35:24.349 --> 03:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
we'll go we'll be done for 26 and
 
03:35:26.550 --> 03:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
27 as this committee makes
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations or puts thoughts out
 
03:35:29.469 --> 03:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
that you know we want to see the
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
business taxes and 25 at this number 26
 
03:35:33.790 --> 03:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
at that number I'll start to populate
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
that as well so if today you decide on a
 
03:35:39.429 --> 03:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
couple of Revenue sources you're like
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay swep we know it's
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
3631 based on law we don't need to
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
debate that tomorrow I'd come in with a
 
03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
sheet sheet filled out with house Ways
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
and Means saying you agreed to
 
03:35:52.990 --> 03:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
3631 um so that your general funds go
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
the first three
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
pages the last page on page five you'll
 
03:36:00.990 --> 03:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
see is it totals everything at the end
 
03:36:03.710 --> 03:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's looks low now until you get
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
all the Dr revenues in there and then
 
03:36:10.469 --> 03:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
billion and then if you go to page seven
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
that would be the highway fund so as you
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
as you may call you have the highway
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
fund unrestricted Revenue as well as the
 
03:36:20.269 --> 03:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
fishing game unrestricted Revenue to
 
03:36:23.710 --> 03:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
estimate um so the highway
 
03:36:25.950 --> 03:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
fund same process I give you the
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
official plan what the um annual
 
03:36:29.710 --> 03:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report numbers
 
03:36:32.429 --> 03:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
potentially are and then for 25 26 and
 
03:36:35.349 --> 03:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
27 I give you agency high and low again
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
the agency only gave you one number so
 
03:36:41.309 --> 03:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
it's the same in both places um you had
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
if you remember there was a single page
 
03:36:45.550 --> 03:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
that safety provided that was a spread
 
03:36:49.389 --> 03:36:49.399 align:start position:0%
sheet looking um document that had 20
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
had 10 years on it but had 25 26 and 27
 
03:36:54.990 --> 03:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
what they thought and a lot of numbers
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
so the road toll was the first number
 
03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
summed and then after that was all the
 
03:37:03.309 --> 03:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
MV fees motor vehicle fees so I sum
 
03:37:06.030 --> 03:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
those up and I add them here the 200,000
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the middle is what you heard do
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
present to you so it's just basically
 
03:37:13.670 --> 03:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the miscellaneous when they um um
 
03:37:16.510 --> 03:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
dispose of surplus vehicles and property
 
03:37:20.429 --> 03:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
um that would go into their Highway
 
03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
fund and then the on page nine would
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
again be the fishing game again this
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
similar process um they presented to you
 
03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
a sheet and you knew they licensing
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
fishing game licenses was the 9.8 and
 
03:37:35.710 --> 03:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
the 10 million respectively and then I
 
03:37:37.750 --> 03:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
summed up the rest of the um list that
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
they provided to give you the um
 
03:37:42.389 --> 03:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
estimate for the other all their other
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue which is 4146 or four just over
 
03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
4 Mill
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
ion typically when you make your
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
estimates you usually go to just the
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
first decimal the reason we go out three
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
places is because of what you see here
 
03:37:55.710 --> 03:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
today like the act the annual
 
03:37:57.910 --> 03:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report goes out
 
03:38:00.469 --> 03:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
three places so we show that um and some
 
03:38:02.309 --> 03:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
of the agency estimates will go out a
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
03:38:06.070 --> 03:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
places um doesn't mean you can't go out
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
three places but it's just it becomes
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
more of a rounding era than
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
anything so that's that's the layout of
 
03:38:14.670 --> 03:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
the document um I don't know if there's
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
any questions but like I said as you
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
make decisions or um agree to
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
potentially what your decisions might be
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'll populate it so that you have it in
 
03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
front of you um everything is on our
 
03:38:27.590 --> 03:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
website so any of the agency documents
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
that if you can't find it in paper you
 
03:38:31.670 --> 03:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
can go out to our our website you can
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
pull up their documents see what they
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
had to say um you can pull up the
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
worksheets will be out there as well so
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
if you're at home because it's you know
 
03:38:40.150 --> 03:38:40.160 align:start position:0%

you email me I can help you out with
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
whatever questions you might have as
 
03:38:54.429 --> 03:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative El me
 
03:38:58.189 --> 03:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you two things one uh people
 
03:39:02.670 --> 03:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
should remember that this is based on
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
current law now uh anybody brings in a
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill that adds or decreases Revenue that
 
03:39:13.750 --> 03:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
is not considered it goes the them and
 
03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
the the finance committee deals with
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
that and
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
um the other one was if we've got
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
questions when we consider
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
individual uh revenues that we should
 
03:39:33.630 --> 03:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
have asked to the agency will you relay
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
them and bring them
 
03:39:39.150 --> 03:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
back I will I will and depending on the
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
timing of what the committee has we'll
 
03:39:43.550 --> 03:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
get them back as quickly as we can um Dr
 
03:39:46.830 --> 03:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
will um have someone of available um in
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
the room as you guys are meeting um to
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
the best of their ability you
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
know they'll try to have someone here
 
03:39:56.189 --> 03:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning um they may not have
 
03:39:57.510 --> 03:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
the answer right then but they'll know
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
what the question is and get it back as
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
quickly as they can um since they are
 
03:40:02.790 --> 03:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
covering other bills and other
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
committees as well um so so they may
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
have some Manpower issues um but yes
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely and to your point reps andal
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
me um if you are looking at uh on page
 
03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
three at the insurance tax
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
and you go back and look at the
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
insurance document you're going to
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
notice that what I have on um fiscal
 
03:40:24.750 --> 03:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
year 26 and 27 on row 14 and 15 and 19
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
and uh 20 respectively are million
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
dollars higher each year than what the
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department presented to you if
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
you may recall they had a million dollar
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
um reduction related to a new program
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to implement that
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
program hasn't passed in law so that's
 
03:40:43.710 --> 03:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
why I raised it back up and if you
 
03:40:44.830 --> 03:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
recall I had said something to the
 
03:40:46.349 --> 03:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner and he said oh that's right
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes um you that's correct put it back up
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
so specifically you're on page three yes
 
03:40:54.550 --> 03:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
the insurance tax column so what are you
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
saying instead of so I'm saying if you
 
03:40:57.309 --> 03:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
look at the sheet the department gave
 
03:40:58.510 --> 03:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
you they're going to have an estimate of
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
158 and 162 okay that's because they
 
03:41:03.150 --> 03:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
removed a million dollars each year for
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
a program that hasn't passed the
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
legislature yet so I've added it back in
 
03:41:10.070 --> 03:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
if that does pass yeah um then we would
 
03:41:11.870 --> 03:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
take care of that our office the LBA
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
would take care of that on the Surplus
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
statement so we would make a negative
 
03:41:17.110 --> 03:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
adjustment on the Surplus statement okay
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
so you don't have to be thinking about
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
that the same with uh to what kind of
 
03:41:22.990 --> 03:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
follow up with the Reps of me any bills
 
03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
you have coming before you if you pass a
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
bill that um has a an impact on Revenue
 
03:41:30.990 --> 03:41:31.000 align:start position:0%
either positively or negatively you
 
03:41:32.189 --> 03:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about what your
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
estimates were here today or in the next
 
03:41:36.510 --> 03:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
few days that will be reflected if it
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
passes the Full House will reflect that
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement is the house
 
03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement is the house
position

03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you
 
03:41:51.870 --> 03:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
um yes represent Brian thank you Mr
 
03:41:54.269 --> 03:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
03:41:57.149 --> 03:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
question Chris um I don't know if you
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
have it handy but I was just looking
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the motor vehicle fees how much uh
 
03:42:03.910 --> 03:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
how much revenue do inspections bring
 
03:42:06.870 --> 03:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
in was it about 2.5 or was it a little
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:19.469 --> 03:42:19.479 align:start position:0%
one moment sorry no no that's I can't
 
03:42:22.510 --> 03:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
recall off the top of my head but I do
 
03:42:29.790 --> 03:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
here they got it it just under 4 million
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
and 25 and then just over uh 4.9 and 26
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you that's registrations in one
 
03:42:53.429 --> 03:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
year that's just just the a
 
03:42:56.189 --> 03:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
motiv oh the inspections just inspection
 
03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
stickers okay would be about five
 
03:43:00.560 --> 03:43:04.750 align:start position:0%
stickers okay would be about five
million

03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:08.349 --> 03:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
okay well I think to I mean one of the
 
03:43:10.590 --> 03:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
things we can do is we can we can work
 
03:43:12.750 --> 03:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
on some of the obvious stuff first and
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
and knock that off um
 
03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
I mean let's start at the end the end
 
03:43:19.510 --> 03:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
here on page
 
03:43:23.189 --> 03:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.269 --> 03:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
um this looks like a real easy
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
one CH the total fishing
 
03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:32.429 align:start position:0%
one CH the total fishing
game

03:43:32.429 --> 03:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
game
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
um oh the to yeah the total is wrong
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
there oh no it's not what do you mean
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
the total's wrong
 
03:43:44.309 --> 03:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
no start at the last page which should
 
03:43:46.149 --> 03:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
be the total sum total of everything
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
that is Happ oh oh okay so it's the fish
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:57.830 --> 03:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're just um Chris the thing that
 
03:44:02.590 --> 03:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
goes into HB is it seven or whatever the
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
so there would be the unrestricted
 
03:44:05.790 --> 03:44:05.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue in
 
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
hb1 is that the question well I I feel
 
03:44:11.229 --> 03:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
like I looked at an older another year
 
03:44:13.149 --> 03:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
and the when we submit our Revenue
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
estimates I feel like it was HB
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
something else so what the what we'll
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
end up doing is putting together a an
 
03:44:22.590 --> 03:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
amendment or of a house resolution so
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
this committee will have a house
 
03:44:25.790 --> 03:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
resolution in your name that will go to
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
the house floor house resolution 17 in
 
03:44:32.429 --> 03:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
2023 resolution from that we will make
 
03:44:34.149 --> 03:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
do an amendment to House Bill one the
 
03:44:36.030 --> 03:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue using those Revenue
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
estimates thank
 
03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
you which all are developed based on
 
03:44:43.950 --> 03:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
what you do with these worksheets and do
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
we need to do anything else with the
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
rest of FY 25 are we only looking at 26
 
03:44:49.680 --> 03:44:50.950 align:start position:0%
rest of FY 25 are we only looking at 26
and

03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:53.950 --> 03:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
27 so you you'll make adjustments the 25
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
is you feel that they need to be made so
 
03:44:59.110 --> 03:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
and and when you do your house
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
resolution you'll see the there's two
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
columns for 25 so the one would be what
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
the a plan was and then any adjustments
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
that this committee made okay so you
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
could go up in some areas and you could
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
go down in other areas and you would
 
03:45:13.229 --> 03:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
have a new Total that you're working
 
03:45:19.309 --> 03:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
so with this so on page nine you would
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
make estimates on row nine 14 and 19 and
 
03:45:26.510 --> 03:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's what would be incorporated into
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
the house resolution yeah I see what
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman um Chris just
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
so I understand if this committee makes
 
03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
adjustments to
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
fy2 that budget's already been passed
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
asked so what is the effect or impact
 
03:45:50.910 --> 03:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
does the house versus Finance then have
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
to vote to adjust the budget based on
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
that or how does that work so a couple
 
03:45:57.189 --> 03:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
of things can happen one it um may be
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
the base that you're using to grow your
 
03:46:01.950 --> 03:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates in 26 and 27 but what
 
03:46:03.630 --> 03:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
it does is it puts notice on that we
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
think the the revenues we projected in
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
23 are not doing as good or doing a lot
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
better than we anticipated and we think
 
03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
that 25 will end potentially here what
 
03:46:15.550 --> 03:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
will happen is that um if the governor
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't already started doing it in this
 
03:46:19.870 --> 03:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
case um she's made started the effort by
 
03:46:24.189 --> 03:46:24.199 align:start position:0%
freezing um uh hiring of positions um
 
03:46:25.590 --> 03:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
there would be need to be some actions
 
03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
taken to make sure at the end of 25 that
 
03:46:30.910 --> 03:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
the budget balances so that you start 26
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
in a positive position and that will be
 
03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
something that the um finance committee
 
03:46:36.990 --> 03:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
would work
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
on and then presumably the Senate would
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
get its shot as well right same with
 
03:46:45.790 --> 03:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
what and then presumably
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
finance and then the full house but then
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
correct the Senate would get it shot
 
03:46:51.189 --> 03:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
right exactly yep yeah it go through the
 
03:46:54.149 --> 03:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
whole process of um Ways and Means would
 
03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
do its estimates go to those estimates
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
will drive what Finance is going to do
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
for an operating budget full body would
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
vote on that if it passes it would go to
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate the Senate would start that
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
process all over again um except for the
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
2023 budget usually there's a committee
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
a conference where you would come back
 
03:47:14.910 --> 03:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
and and a subgroup of the finance
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
committee members with a cou usually a
 
03:47:18.510 --> 03:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
couple members of ways and means would
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
meet and and um negotiate any
 
03:47:22.990 --> 03:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
differences and then it would go back to
 
03:47:25.149 --> 03:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
the governor if the legislature approves
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
it then go back to the governor to
 
03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
either sign it veto it or let it pass La
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
into law without a signature and then if
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's vetoed we start a different
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
process thank you thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:36.960 --> 03:47:38.349 align:start position:0%
process thank you thank you Mr chair
representative

03:47:38.349 --> 03:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:47:42.189 --> 03:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chairman so Chris
 
03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question do you
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
know if uh the p wish to sell a lot more
 
03:47:49.149 --> 03:47:49.159 align:start position:0%
hiker safe cards are included in these
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
numbers I was talking to rep Spain and
 
03:47:56.189 --> 03:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
no you don't know or no they're not hi
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
the hiker uh safety card is a dedicated
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
fund a restricted fund so any money that
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
goes into that goes into that fund
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
unless statutes change to direct any
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
increase to another place but this is
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
there this would be the fishing games
 
03:48:11.950 --> 03:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
general fund they their money that
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been allocated yet things like uh
 
03:48:18.149 --> 03:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
the hike safe card or um you know the
 
03:48:20.429 --> 03:48:20.439 align:start position:0%
non-game species accounts uh some of
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
these things that you may hear about if
 
03:48:22.750 --> 03:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
you're in some of these other committees
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
are dedicated funds the the duck stamp
 
03:48:26.750 --> 03:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Pheasant stamp you know those are
 
03:48:29.149 --> 03:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
all dedicated monies for the Department
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
for those purposes representative Brier
 
03:48:35.149 --> 03:48:35.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Chris uh
 
03:48:37.710 --> 03:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
question are the unref unded road tolls
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
reflected in here at all they are yep
 
03:48:44.149 --> 03:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's in the all the other all the other
 
03:48:44.159 --> 03:48:48.710 align:start position:0%
it's in the all the other all the other
okay

03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
followup followup is that the most of
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:56.790 --> 03:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
or a big chunk of that's made up of the
 
03:49:01.229 --> 03:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
UN it is a it's a um so in 25 it's
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
estimated it was uh 792 th000 of the um
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
ohrv unref unded road toll came in and
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
then just over a million in the Marine
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
unref unded road toll so going in 26 and
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
27 they they've projected um$ 850,000
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
and um a million dollars in each of
 
03:49:23.349 --> 03:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
those two and it is their biggest other
 
03:49:25.469 --> 03:49:25.479 align:start position:0%
okay that combined yes thank
 
03:49:27.870 --> 03:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:49:30.510 --> 03:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
jelery thank
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
you on the unrestricted
 
03:49:36.870 --> 03:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
um rebates on the road
 
03:49:41.790 --> 03:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
toll is that number going up or down and
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
why so the the number had gone up
 
03:49:47.670 --> 03:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
um during covid the number went up so it
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
had been a fairly consistent number and
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll let repon Brier step in if I
 
03:49:54.229 --> 03:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
speak out a turn here since he has maybe
 
03:49:56.550 --> 03:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
more information than I um but it had
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
been a fairly uh consistent number and
 
03:50:01.309 --> 03:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
then during covid um there was a lot
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
more um off tril activities and Marine
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
activity because people couldn't be near
 
03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
one another so they were getting their
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
ohvs and their boats on the water so
 
03:50:12.389 --> 03:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
there was a higher um licensing um you
 
03:50:14.110 --> 03:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
know not license excuse me the higher
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
use of that so there was more claims
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
potential for unref unded road toll and
 
03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
people didn't come forward and claim it
 
03:50:23.229 --> 03:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
so it just goes into that that
 
03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
pool they've come to a it's starting to
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
flatten out now at that numbers that I
 
03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned when ripson Brier asked this
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
question therefore going forward we
 
03:50:34.630 --> 03:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
should look around a million dollars
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
rebate yeah it's been that way for since
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
covid and they're not seeing it come
 
03:50:41.790 --> 03:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
down significantly and the reason it
 
03:50:44.670 --> 03:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
went up was because government
 
03:50:46.750 --> 03:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions telling us not to get
 
03:50:48.670 --> 03:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
together made people get together to go
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
out into the fresh air well I think that
 
03:50:55.030 --> 03:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
people were going outside more often um
 
03:50:56.590 --> 03:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
during covid and they saw that's where
 
03:50:58.910 --> 03:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
you see an increase in the uh fish uh
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
the fishing licenses as well and the Hun
 
03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.229 align:start position:0%
the fishing licenses as well and the Hun
licenses

03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
so sorry
 
03:51:09.030 --> 03:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
I okay as I look at the um fishing game
 
03:51:11.309 --> 03:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
fund here I see numbers that are very
 
03:51:14.149 --> 03:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
very static and I'm wondering if
 
03:51:16.670 --> 03:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
somebody um this probably could be
 
03:51:21.030 --> 03:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
something we could finalize and vote on
 
03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
um would would somebody like to make a
 
03:51:27.750 --> 03:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
motion to I'll I'll make a motion okay
 
03:51:27.760 --> 03:51:29.269 align:start position:0%
motion to I'll I'll make a motion okay
that

03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:31.990 --> 03:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'll make a motion that we accept the
 
03:51:34.750 --> 03:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
recom recommended numbers from uh
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game for Revenue estimates so
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
that would mean the uh the estimate for
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
2025 would just be
 
03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
13.9 uh so Chris you're recommending
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we for example 2025 we would just
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
say 13.9 there yes okay and what I would
 
03:51:53.790 --> 03:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
do is I would adjust the um other column
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
to be 14 uh
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
4.1 so I would drop the uh 46 that's
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
there okay so you'll you can make those
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
adjustments based on what we decided
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
today okay thank you and when you see
 
03:52:06.349 --> 03:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
this tomorrow you'll see that those
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments are there so if I don't do
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
something that the committee thought I
 
03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
should have done you can correct me do I
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
motion second by representative
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.910 --> 03:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
that probably should make a motion let's
 
03:52:29.920 --> 03:52:32.750 align:start position:0%
that probably should make a motion let's
see

03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
Bri Mr chairman I have a question for
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
Chris while you're discussing what can I
 
03:52:42.510 --> 03:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
ask Chris a question sure Chris looking
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
let see what I'm fishing game fund and
 
03:52:49.389 --> 03:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
looking at their
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
numbers there
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
was a a decrease in Marine unfunded road
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
toll an increase in un oh HRV unfunded
 
03:53:02.520 --> 03:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
toll an increase in un oh HRV unfunded
road

03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
road
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
toll uh and then the interest savings
 
03:53:08.950 --> 03:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
was an
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
increase do you see these numbers
 
03:53:11.199 --> 03:53:15.790 align:start position:0%
increase do you see these numbers
changing

03:53:15.790 --> 03:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
my question I guess my question is are
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
these numbers so close and static to
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
each other that that you feel that the
 
03:53:25.349 --> 03:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
numbers that are on here
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
are are what we should be
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
addressing I do I I mean I would um
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
trust in what the department has
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
provided and I think the um schedule
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
shows that those numbers are fairly
 
03:53:39.910 --> 03:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
static I mean they do fluctuate a little
 
03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
bit but I think that they're projecting
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
um better than they may have in in um
 
03:53:49.030 --> 03:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
prior to 19 so the numbers were a couple
 
03:53:52.590 --> 03:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
hundred, less prior to 19 each
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
year um this the interest number goes to
 
03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
what was talked about with the treasurer
 
03:53:59.590 --> 03:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
the when she came in and having the pool
 
03:54:02.149 --> 03:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
of cash that she's able to invest once
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
she invests that and she gets the
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
interest return she then parses it out
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
to those funds that are allowed to have
 
03:54:09.590 --> 03:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
it allocated to it fishing game fund is
 
03:54:11.189 --> 03:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
one of them that in statute it says
 
03:54:14.550 --> 03:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
interest goes to that fund
 
03:54:16.950 --> 03:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative opal thank you Mr
 
03:54:18.349 --> 03:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'm I'm going to ask the
 
03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
committee's Indulgence as a a first
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
termer um I'm not sure whether this is
 
03:54:25.349 --> 03:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
the appropriate forum for this question
 
03:54:27.630 --> 03:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
but relative to the fishing game fund I
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
have a constituent who asked me she uh
 
03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
has a store in one of my towns and sells
 
03:54:39.030 --> 03:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
the the permits for off-road um and I
 
03:54:42.910 --> 03:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
guess the issue for for her is the
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
amount of time that fishing game is
 
03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
giving her to remit the fees from the
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
sale and it's apparently it's a fairly
 
03:54:54.189 --> 03:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
short period of time maybe a matter of
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
um two weeks at the most and she was
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
asking me about exploring the
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
possibility of extending that to perhaps
 
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:06.439 align:start position:0%
month I'm not sure whether that has it
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
might have an impact on this I'm me
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
actually not even sure where to start in
 
03:55:14.710 --> 03:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
terms of pursuing that but um I I
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
thought since we're discussing fishing
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
game I'd bring it up and if it's
 
03:55:19.990 --> 03:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
completely inappropriate the chairman
 
03:55:23.229 --> 03:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
would tell me to hush well I think what
 
03:55:24.750 --> 03:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
I would suggest is that probably would
 
03:55:26.110 --> 03:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
need to be in touch with fishing game
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
department and their Administrative
 
03:55:30.070 --> 03:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
Office to find out why they're providing
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
the time frames that they are it may be
 
03:55:33.750 --> 03:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
statutorily required which then would
 
03:55:36.030 --> 03:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
require the legislature to do something
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
it may be internally they require
 
03:55:39.790 --> 03:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
something to get the money so they can
 
03:55:41.950 --> 03:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
account for it but I can't speak to that
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of impacting this it wouldn't
 
03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
impact what you're doing today because
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
you're basing it on what's current
 
03:55:46.640 --> 03:55:47.790 align:start position:0%
you're basing it on what's current
practice

03:55:47.790 --> 03:55:47.800 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
today thank you thank you Mr
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
chair okay uh discussion on this uh we
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
have a motion to accept this as
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
presented by fishing game uh
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
03:56:04.110 --> 03:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
Aly I realized I have another question
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
how much
 
03:56:12.550 --> 03:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:15.229 --> 03:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
numbers so the uh
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
the estimate for 26 and 27 was
 
03:56:23.710 --> 03:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
250,000 the amount that um was was shown
 
03:56:28.790 --> 03:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
400,000 the budgeted amount was 100,000
 
03:56:31.560 --> 03:56:33.469 align:start position:0%
400,000 the budgeted amount was 100,000
for

03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:33.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:56:36.910 --> 03:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
25 so the department um again interest
 
03:56:38.990 --> 03:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
isn't something that um has been
 
03:56:41.830 --> 03:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
collected by agencies for quite a long
 
03:56:44.950 --> 03:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
time until all the arpa and car's money
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
um the fund having a balance to it the
 
03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
efficient game fund has a a a bounce in
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
it so when the treasurer was um putting
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
things into interest bearing
 
03:57:04.990 --> 03:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
um acts the fishing game fund has
 
03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
benefited from that significantly prior
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
to um that you would see that the number
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
for uh 19,000 back in 22 back in 21 it
 
03:57:14.680 --> 03:57:16.189 align:start position:0%
for uh 19,000 back in 22 back in 21 it
was

03:57:16.189 --> 03:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
2500 um 20 it was
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
86,000 so it they never had a big number
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
there they have and they've been
 
03:57:25.229 --> 03:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
watching it the last few years the the
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
legislature um leaned on the department
 
03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
in 2023 because their estimate was
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
25,000 and they said you you seem to be
 
03:57:33.790 --> 03:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
doing a little bit better than that can
 
03:57:35.910 --> 03:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
we increase it for 24 and
 
03:57:38.189 --> 03:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
25 um the administrator carried that
 
03:57:41.469 --> 03:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
forward into 26 and
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
27 it's a long-winded response hopefully
 
03:57:45.429 --> 03:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
I am answered your
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you CHR it appears that
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have as much in the
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
treasury right over the next few years
 
03:58:00.070 --> 03:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
so the interest should be going
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
down it's it's anticipated that um
 
03:58:05.830 --> 03:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to see 26 similar to 25 27
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
should come down a little bit overall
 
03:58:11.550 --> 03:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
but um in 28 and 29 you probably won't
 
03:58:13.149 --> 03:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
have the same balances because all of
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
arpa should be gone
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and then with fishing game when they
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
present it to you they they express the
 
03:58:22.469 --> 03:58:22.479 align:start position:0%
idea that their fund is um uh
 
03:58:24.429 --> 03:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
insufficient to support their operating
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
activities so they they don't think
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to have much of a balance
 
03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of this by anym that's still
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
to being determined um but
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
she so yeah they it basically will start
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
to go away and they won't have as much
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
revenue I have a comment if I may sure
 
03:58:44.149 --> 03:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh fish and gains Revenue has been
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
insufficient for its
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
activities for as long as I can
 
03:58:54.830 --> 03:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:57.710 --> 03:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
years so the fact that the interest uh
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
less is that going to affect it doesn't
 
03:59:04.030 --> 03:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
look like they're taking that into
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
account for
 
03:59:09.070 --> 03:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
2027 um maybe it's because they expect
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
increased license
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue so I I can't speak to why the
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
department felt that was they were
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable at the 250 amount but I do
 
03:59:22.349 --> 03:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
know that they were talking with the
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
treasur and others when they were
 
03:59:27.389 --> 03:59:27.399 align:start position:0%
putting this together so um I'm not in a
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
place to say that's not a good number
 
03:59:34.670 --> 03:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
um fair enough all right any other
 
03:59:41.469 --> 03:59:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:44.189 --> 03:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
numbers okay then let's uh let's take a
 
03:59:45.910 --> 03:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
vote on
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
this well if you look at page
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
nine then you will see what we're doing
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
is we are rounding so for the um
 
03:59:58.269 --> 03:59:58.279 align:start position:0%
estimate on line nine it'll be
 
03:59:58.279 --> 04:00:00.269 align:start position:0%
estimate on line nine it'll be
13.9

04:00:00.269 --> 04:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
13.9
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh oh wait a minute I'm sorry uh well y
 
04:00:07.710 --> 04:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
we do we fill in each of these items so
 
04:00:11.110 --> 04:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
the licenses licenses and all other or
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
do we just do a total so I I believe
 
04:00:14.830 --> 04:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
that what you want wanted to do was to
 
04:00:18.030 --> 04:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
have um on row 9 column A be $9.8
 
04:00:23.070 --> 04:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
million yeah row 9 column B to be $4.1
 
04:00:26.910 --> 04:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
million row 9 column C to Total of$ 13.9
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
million 1.9 right and okay if I could be
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
as bold to just move you down to rows 14
 
04:00:36.229 --> 04:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
and 19 which are the same I think the
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
committee was going to go with 10
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
million under row column a 4 million
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
under column B for a total of 4 million
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
under column C for both of 26 and 27
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but if I'm jumping ahead I
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
apologize no that's that's uh where I
 
04:00:57.389 --> 04:00:57.399 align:start position:0%
was going so we filled that in
 
04:00:59.550 --> 04:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
um does that answer your question
 
04:01:01.550 --> 04:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg
 
04:01:04.349 --> 04:01:04.359 align:start position:0%
okay any other concerns questions
 
04:01:07.149 --> 04:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
comments before we vote on accepting
 
04:01:07.159 --> 04:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
comments before we vote on accepting
these

04:01:09.830 --> 04:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:01:15.309 --> 04:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
numbers okay sing yes repres B or is uh
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
really in all the numbers or
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
you um motion second well this so what's
 
04:01:23.149 --> 04:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
going to happen correct me if I'm wrong
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're going to vote on each
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the items and uh eventually it'll
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
Chris will take all this and put it into
 
04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
a house resolution and then we'll vote
 
04:01:36.710 --> 04:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
on the house resolution in here right
 
04:01:44.149 --> 04:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:54.630 --> 04:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
motion would you speak louder micone use
 
04:01:54.640 --> 04:01:55.750 align:start position:0%
motion would you speak louder micone use
your

04:01:55.750 --> 04:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
microphone if the initial motion was to
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
modify 9C and now we're going to be
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
modifying you know a b and c for nine no
 
04:02:06.750 --> 04:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not modifying no we're
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
just uh placing it there to vote
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
on correct yeah so we're want amend
 
04:02:16.590 --> 04:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
okay never mind no we haven't we haven't
 
04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
amended anything so what
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
were're you were suggesting an amendment
 
04:02:26.149 --> 04:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
we had a motion in a second yeah or not
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
the expanded I mean it's kind of
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
ludicrous but um you know we're
 
04:02:32.429 --> 04:02:32.439 align:start position:0%
basically oh I'm s well maybe I
 
04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
misstated it the motion uh who made the
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
motion the motion is to the whole thing
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
I was my motion was to uh take the
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
Department's recommendations and approve
 
04:02:43.600 --> 04:02:44.429 align:start position:0%
Department's recommendations and approve
it

04:02:44.429 --> 04:02:44.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
right so it was for the whole for the
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
whole thing okay yeah all right okay and
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
and representative Al Mayu seconded a
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
motion for the whole table
 
04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
okay very good so by a show of hands all
 
04:03:01.309 --> 04:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
table any
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
opposed okay seeing none it's uh I don't
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
know if we have to record the actual
 
04:03:11.229 --> 04:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
just the only thing that counts is the
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
final resolution there the final
 
04:03:16.510 --> 04:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
resolution rest just but just for notes
 
04:03:32.149 --> 04:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
14 Mr chairman did yes I know it's an
 
04:03:37.229 --> 04:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
informal vote and it doesn't really
 
04:03:38.710 --> 04:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
count till the resolution but how many
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
did you count 14 I think you missed
 
04:03:44.670 --> 04:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
yourself did I miss one two three four
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
five six iount 10 11 12
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:57.149 --> 04:03:57.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay so we can check off fishing
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
game Mr chairman that was a good
 
04:04:01.590 --> 04:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishment fishing game that's
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
checked off is it checked off
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
permanently well no not not permanently
 
04:04:10.389 --> 04:04:10.399 align:start position:0%
no uh so we're we're going to go through
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
um we're not going through everything
 
04:04:14.590 --> 04:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
today because as we talked about the the
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
Dr information that just came in of
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
course will present in a worksheet
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and we will go through each of
 
04:04:25.030 --> 04:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
those items um and and eventually vote
 
04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
on each one then when everything is all
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
done we've gone through everything he'll
 
04:04:31.710 --> 04:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
put together a house resolution and
 
04:04:34.149 --> 04:04:34.159 align:start position:0%
we'll that'll contain all the estimates
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
we've come up with and we'll vote on
 
04:04:40.830 --> 04:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
represent opal you have a
 
04:04:52.149 --> 04:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
question when Chris was mentioned
 
04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
numbers and you were mentioning numbers
 
04:04:57.670 --> 04:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
you said we'll have a 98 a 41 A
 
04:05:00.429 --> 04:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
139 yeah we're basically there we're
 
04:05:02.110 --> 04:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
basically rounding up to the nearest
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
13.94% n
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay so that's fishing game let's
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
see what other straightforward Revenue
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
estimates can we take care of
 
04:05:23.760 --> 04:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
estimates can we take care of
P

04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
P
 
04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
okay the
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
highway the highway
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
fund I think the highway fund looks
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
pretty solid page seven the the only
 
04:05:38.149 --> 04:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
concern I have which is uh well it's not
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
a concern yet but if if a proposed bill
 
04:05:43.030 --> 04:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
passes we'll lose some revenue on the uh
 
04:05:47.550 --> 04:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
about 4 .9 and 3.9 in inspection fee
 
04:05:50.469 --> 04:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue but that's based on the current
 
04:05:57.870 --> 04:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
okay and so if we fill in this table it
 
04:06:02.349 --> 04:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
be a similar thing looking looking at
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
each uh if you look at column n um row
 
04:06:20.590 --> 04:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
133.5 Highway
 
04:06:29.590 --> 04:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue well no the total so the total
 
04:06:29.600 --> 04:06:32.710 align:start position:0%
Revenue well no the total so the total
is

04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:32.720 --> 04:06:38.469 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
261.5 and then obviously would line 14
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
and line 19 we would round each of those
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate
 
04:06:48.239 --> 04:06:50.550 align:start position:0%
to the appropriate
127.71

04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
127.71
 
04:06:50.560 --> 04:06:54.189 align:start position:0%
127.71
14.2

04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
1317 and
 
04:06:55.800 --> 04:06:57.630 align:start position:0%
1317 and
[Music]

04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.319 --> 04:07:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
16

04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.110 --> 04:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
lead on uh fiscal year 26 under road
 
04:07:23.830 --> 04:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.149 --> 04:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
127.71 is at
 
04:07:31.790 --> 04:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.429 --> 04:07:36.439 align:start position:0%
okay and then uh the final total on line
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.149 --> 04:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
2628 thank you represent
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
Aly I wish that we had asked more
 
04:08:03.070 --> 04:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
questions at the
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
time I'm not really remembering but um
 
04:08:10.550 --> 04:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
26 looks like it is
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
the the Lost year from having changed
 
04:08:16.830 --> 04:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
from a four to a
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
fiveyear um registration
 
04:08:20.359 --> 04:08:22.030 align:start position:0%
fiveyear um registration
plan

04:08:22.030 --> 04:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
plan
 
04:08:22.040 --> 04:08:24.389 align:start position:0%
plan
um

04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't look like a lot of people
 
04:08:31.349 --> 04:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
are going to be buy buying new cars for
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
quite a
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.630 --> 04:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
and and but but the the the St State's
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
fee as versus the town fees are
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
dependent only on there is a car there
 
04:08:57.030 --> 04:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
which is right a big car or a small car
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
and a luxury car
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
or it's registration plus the weight
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
what it's registration and then the
 
04:09:08.309 --> 04:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
registration are based on weight yeah
 
04:09:10.030 --> 04:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
right so think a navigator is going to
 
04:09:21.790 --> 04:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
I been followed by follow they've been
 
04:09:26.109 --> 04:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
following me sometimes would someone
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion on this
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.950 --> 04:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't think I'll second it
 
04:09:49.630 --> 04:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
I'll vote for it okay uh representa tney
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.389 --> 04:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all uh any discussion any
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion on these
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
numbers okay all in favor show by
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
raising your
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
hand okay anyone
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.149 --> 04:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
five so the commissioner did not talk
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
about about uh Medicaid recoveries
 
04:10:48.349 --> 04:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
correct that was the Department of
 
04:10:50.309 --> 04:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services okay that's
 
04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
Services deps finding people sorry it
 
04:11:06.750 --> 04:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
depends on finding the people who have
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
been on Medicaid and die leaving a car
 
04:11:13.790 --> 04:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
or a house or something like that which
 
04:11:17.309 --> 04:11:17.319 align:start position:0%
can be uh from which the cost of
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid can be
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
sequestered and if you're part of a
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
couple and only one of you dies then the
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:30.800 --> 04:11:34.189 align:start position:0%
 
while

04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so it tends to wander up and down
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
out of that small
 
04:11:39.040 --> 04:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
out of that small
amount

04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right so in this case we are
 
04:11:47.149 --> 04:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
just looking at uh column
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
Q um row 11 would be 2.2 column Q row 16
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.750 --> 04:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.070 --> 04:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
3.1 and these were the agency
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay someone like to make a
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
motion on me sure the general
 
04:12:24.189 --> 04:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
population that is involved in
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
this um is declining so why are the
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
numbers going
 
04:12:33.070 --> 04:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
up so as they presented um audits take a
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
little bit of time so they they will
 
04:12:38.590 --> 04:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
continue to drop down going forward but
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
they suggested that there's some audits
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
in play that they may see that collected
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the next couple of years but you're
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
not going to see the
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
numbers um probably six years ago eight
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
years ago you used to see numbers in the
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
15 to $2 million range
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
um we refer to that as probably your low
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit they they've taken care of
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
that they've reconciled that now we're
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
getting to a point where um it's it's
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to be very small numbers and as
 
04:13:06.910 --> 04:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
more and more of the
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
um individuals covered by Medicaid go on
 
04:13:11.309 --> 04:13:11.319 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care contracts the managed
 
04:13:14.710 --> 04:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
care companies are um um responsible for
 
04:13:17.469 --> 04:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
doing this work and then it offsets any
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
future negotiations of what the state
 
04:13:19.319 --> 04:13:20.229 align:start position:0%
future negotiations of what the state
cost

04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:13:23.710 --> 04:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
is so but they felt comfortable and
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's why they had suggested um the
 
04:13:28.750 --> 04:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
number drop in uh fiscal year 25 you can
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
see the estimate was 3 million uh they
 
04:13:33.070 --> 04:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
came in with 2.2 million because what
 
04:13:35.389 --> 04:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
they see right now they're not going to
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
get there that they're not going to
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
um resolve any of their audits at by the
 
04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
end of that uh the end of this FIS
 
04:13:43.720 --> 04:13:45.269 align:start position:0%
end of that uh the end of this FIS
year

04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
um but rep M's Point earlier it's it's
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
been around the three two and a half to
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
three and a half million in the last few
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
years representa Aly I'm questioning
 
04:14:02.269 --> 04:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
lines nine and 10 total they don't add
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
up to what
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
the official plan for the utility
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
property tax and Statewide retain
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
Property Tax Plus this is and they don't
 
04:14:18.429 --> 04:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
add up to certainly don't add up to are
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
you looking at column R which line are
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
you looking at at the Total Line r that
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
would be all your general funds and
 
04:14:26.469 --> 04:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
education trust funds so it's the three
 
04:14:29.950 --> 04:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
pages in total so Pages three through
 
04:14:29.960 --> 04:14:33.149 align:start position:0%
pages in total so Pages three through
five

04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:35.670 --> 04:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
oh we're going backwards on the
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
worksheet so yeah yeah that's
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
confusing try so that seems pretty low
 
04:14:46.750 --> 04:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
but you haven't put in other numbers
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
correct so once the Dr numbers are in
 
04:14:50.670 --> 04:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
there it'll be um closer to what you're
 
04:14:53.030 --> 04:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeing on the first row yeah it'll be
 
04:14:56.030 --> 04:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
two billion and and some
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
change would someone like to make a
 
04:14:59.950 --> 04:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
motion to accept
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh column Medicaid recoveries okay
 
04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:07.760 --> 04:15:10.710 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:15:14.070 --> 04:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion more discussion on
 
04:15:14.080 --> 04:15:15.710 align:start position:0%
okay any discussion more discussion on
Medicaid

04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.229 --> 04:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
none the numbers are column Q so this is
 
04:15:27.109 --> 04:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
all in column Q row 11
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
2.2 row 16
 
04:15:34.750 --> 04:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
3.1 all in favor raise your
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
hand any opposed
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be nice if the rest of the
 
04:15:47.070 --> 04:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
columns were this
 
04:15:47.080 --> 04:15:49.429 align:start position:0%
columns were this
easy

04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
easy
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
that's I think colum ke could
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
be now is that all let's see if there's
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
anything else I think everything
 
04:16:01.109 --> 04:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
else Dr brought today right um no
 
04:16:04.830 --> 04:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
Lottery Revenue tobacco settlement okay
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
Other M M Mr chair before you leave page
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
five um the committee could look at the
 
04:16:12.990 --> 04:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
swept since that's statutorily assigned
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay at
 
04:16:16.990 --> 04:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
3631 for each year now we don't have low
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
and high estimates there I didn't put
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
anything in there CU I was waiting to
 
04:16:22.030 --> 04:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
see if the Dr would just include it on
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
their stuff they but we all know what it
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
is it it doesn't change 63.1 yeah yeah
 
04:16:31.070 --> 04:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
it the amount collected can sometimes be
 
04:16:32.550 --> 04:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit higher but it has to just
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
do with how they set the rate and
 
04:16:44.030 --> 04:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
all right so um continuing our um
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
process of working
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
backwards um now we'll go to column p on
 
04:16:55.080 --> 04:16:55.950 align:start position:0%
backwards um now we'll go to column p on
page

04:16:55.950 --> 04:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
five so as Chris was just pointing out
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
the so now row so again just I'm just
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.229 --> 04:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
363.15 point1
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
okay um any further discussion on that
 
04:17:58.119 --> 04:18:00.790 align:start position:0%
okay um any further discussion on that
number

04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.030 --> 04:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
3631 seeing none all in favor of
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.720 --> 04:18:24.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:18:24.109 --> 04:18:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:27.149 --> 04:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
understand um represent El me yes I'd
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
just like to point out that this has
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
been constant without regard to
 
04:18:34.990 --> 04:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.510 --> 04:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.520 --> 04:18:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
um so utility property TX that we did
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
discuss today so we
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.199 --> 04:19:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
four

04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:19:11.309 --> 04:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
um well I guess we can yeah continue to
 
04:19:13.750 --> 04:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
work backwards on page 4 so the the last
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
column column
 
04:19:15.439 --> 04:19:17.070 align:start position:0%
column column
n

04:19:17.070 --> 04:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
n
 
04:19:20.469 --> 04:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
um I don't think for our purposes we
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
heard testimony as to why they thought
 
04:19:24.510 --> 04:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
these were the numbers I'm not sure we
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
have any additional knowledge that would
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
change these but would anyone like to
 
04:19:31.229 --> 04:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
make a comment or do we agree that as
 
04:19:31.239 --> 04:19:33.910 align:start position:0%
make a comment or do we agree that as
presented

04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
represent okay um represent ative um you
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
making a motion to accept as
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative tyy is making a motion to
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.030 --> 04:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
in Y
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
correct second on
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh any
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussion all in favor raise your
 
04:20:30.910 --> 04:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
opposed represent Murphy I assume you
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
good okay
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to work backwards Lottery
 
04:20:46.000 --> 04:20:48.670 align:start position:0%
continuing to work backwards Lottery
Revenue

04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't know is there any any reason
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
to expect anyone feel that that should
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
Lottery yes representative Murphy um did
 
04:21:03.469 --> 04:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
we not discuss there's a bill to
 
04:21:05.550 --> 04:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
increase the hours for Kino would that
 
04:21:07.469 --> 04:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
make a difference doesn't matter okay
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay then no anything we do is based on
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
even if you know it's coming up for a
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
vote in two weeks it's not if we're
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
still if we're working on this we just
 
04:21:22.189 --> 04:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
based on what current LA is
 
04:21:22.199 --> 04:21:23.950 align:start position:0%
based on what current LA is
representative

04:21:23.950 --> 04:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:28.269 --> 04:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
erery yeah and and to that topic uh you
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
know would be a small section but gaming
 
04:21:35.109 --> 04:21:35.119 align:start position:0%
overall depends on what what laws passed
 
04:21:38.349 --> 04:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
this year there may be a reduction uh in
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
gaming there may be an increase uh the
 
04:21:43.870 --> 04:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
overall economy apply because when the
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
economy goes bad there's an increase in
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
gaming for some reason which
 
04:21:50.119 --> 04:21:52.670 align:start position:0%
gaming for some reason which
makes

04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
makes
 
04:21:58.229 --> 04:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
umate yeah well that's true too but
 
04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
so okay so um so the numbers if we
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
assume that we don't have any judgment
 
04:22:08.349 --> 04:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
beyond what uh has been presented to us
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
by Lottery then column M Lottery Revenue
 
04:22:15.790 --> 04:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
row 11
 
04:22:19.630 --> 04:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
180.0 row 16
 
04:22:22.990 --> 04:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
172.5 row 21
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
172.5 any further
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor of
 
04:22:29.790 --> 04:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
going with those
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
numbers okay anyone
 
04:22:35.469 --> 04:22:35.479 align:start position:0%
opposed you're opposed and you're for
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
it I Less on game
 
04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right continuing to work back
 
04:22:47.070 --> 04:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
towards other what is what was other
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
Chris so other is the uh mainly the
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
interest on the money in the treasury
 
04:22:55.389 --> 04:22:55.399 align:start position:0%
it's abandoned property and then about
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
200 other um accounts that agencies
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
deposit revenue from a lot of
 
04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um some uh courts some um
 
04:23:06.640 --> 04:23:08.469 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um some uh courts some um
safety

04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh Corrections you know anybody that
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
collects money that's not dedicated to a
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
restricted fund it would go to treasury
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
in one of those accounts and be counted
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
as other secretary state has a number of
 
04:23:20.349 --> 04:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
that of
 
04:23:20.359 --> 04:23:22.269 align:start position:0%
that of
those

04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like that's uh pretty
 
04:23:27.750 --> 04:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
static as well does anyone have any
 
04:23:29.550 --> 04:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that represent El me we
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
usually got a long list of all of them
 
04:23:38.309 --> 04:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
along with with um the amounts more or
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
less that they were providing but but I
 
04:23:44.189 --> 04:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
don't think any of us ever got anything
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
04:23:49.429 --> 04:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
list so so the department when they came
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
in Department of administrative services
 
04:23:53.189 --> 04:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
along with the treasury Department
 
04:23:55.269 --> 04:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
provided you a document where they
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
showed you uh about 10 to 12 of what
 
04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
they would call their Heavy Hitters
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
which included abandoned property and
 
04:24:03.910 --> 04:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
other and a couple of others and then
 
04:24:06.910 --> 04:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
they provided a
 
04:24:10.349 --> 04:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
list um in the back of the report of
 
04:24:12.830 --> 04:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
like the 200 other fund that they
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
collect not the amounts that they get
 
04:24:15.710 --> 04:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
because some of them are a couple
 
04:24:17.469 --> 04:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars if that some could be a
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
few thousand so they tried to show you
 
04:24:22.309 --> 04:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
the the the ones that were a million or
 
04:24:24.990 --> 04:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
so plus and then all the other types of
 
04:24:26.189 --> 04:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
revenues they collect so they did
 
04:24:32.109 --> 04:24:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.109 --> 04:24:35.119 align:start position:0%
committee when you when you bring the
 
04:24:37.070 --> 04:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
updated spreadsheet
 
04:24:39.870 --> 04:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um how will you indicate the
 
04:24:43.109 --> 04:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
columns that we've approved will there
 
04:24:45.870 --> 04:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
be some way you can indicate the columns
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
that we approved so I can highlight The
 
04:24:50.309 --> 04:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
Columns that you've gone through and and
 
04:24:53.790 --> 04:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
um considered yourself completed yeah um
 
04:24:55.950 --> 04:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
and you would see that not only would
 
04:24:57.109 --> 04:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
they be highlighted but the figures
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
would also be in there under the roow
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the house Ways and Means estimate
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay perfect um and then that would
 
04:25:05.229 --> 04:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
leave or help you focus on those columns
 
04:25:06.750 --> 04:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
that aren't um shaded so you know what
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
you have left to do y thank you
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
yep yes represent opal
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question I can't I'm not
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
sure whether I've forgotten or I I
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
missed one day so I wasn't here I am
 
04:25:22.349 --> 04:25:22.359 align:start position:0%
assuming that the reason it is going
 
04:25:26.670 --> 04:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
down from 25 to 26 to 27 is interest
 
04:25:36.109 --> 04:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
you okay yeah so
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
um this is another one where I'm not
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
sure we have any information beyond what
 
04:25:49.030 --> 04:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
has been presented to refute anything um
 
04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.750 --> 04:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.910 --> 04:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
15.5 we'll have a class in rounding
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
later of course I already made a mistake
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.349 --> 04:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
round well we're rounding we're rounding
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
to no we're we're rounding to the
 
04:26:19.920 --> 04:26:21.550 align:start position:0%
to no we're we're rounding to the
nearest

04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
nearest
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
10th so that would have so it would have
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
to be 0 five 52 or something to go to 0.
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
five uh to go to0
 
04:26:34.710 --> 04:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
6 so it's 1
 
04:26:34.720 --> 04:26:36.710 align:start position:0%
6 so it's 1
15.5

04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
15.5
 
04:26:43.269 --> 04:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:47.040 --> 04:26:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
120.0

04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
maybe more or less um okay any um
 
04:27:03.229 --> 04:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:12.990 --> 04:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:14.910 --> 04:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
all in uh any
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor
 
04:27:19.670 --> 04:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
hand anyone opposed
 
04:27:22.880 --> 04:27:26.670 align:start position:0%
hand anyone opposed
no

04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay represent El me i' just like to
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
point out before we leave this uh topic
 
04:27:35.510 --> 04:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
24 we
 
04:27:40.590 --> 04:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
had aund we
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
had 30 3,00 uh million more than we got
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
in interest this would be probably uh in
 
04:27:54.269 --> 04:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to get in 25 which is 24
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
more than we're going to get in 26 which
 
04:28:01.950 --> 04:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
is six more than we're going to get in
 
04:28:01.960 --> 04:28:03.750 align:start position:0%
is six more than we're going to get in
27

04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
27
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
so the total of those that we had
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
sitting around in interest
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
was more like
 
04:28:14.560 --> 04:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
was more like
um

04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:27.229 --> 04:28:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
24 I'm not sure I understand what's the
 
04:28:33.210 --> 04:28:33.220 align:start position:0%
60 million um difference between
 
04:28:33.220 --> 04:28:35.309 align:start position:0%
60 million um difference between
[Music]

04:28:35.309 --> 04:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:28:42.349 --> 04:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
183.2 in the draft CA uh cfer and uh 100
 
04:28:46.030 --> 04:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
20 in 07 oh oh I should saying 60
 
04:28:52.910 --> 04:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any um oh no that's right
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
we're done with it we voted on that one
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:07.550 --> 04:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward changed in decades so
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
well it's changed this year so column K
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
beer Tech X row 11 test my rounding
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
12.5 row 16 13.0 these are easy and uh
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:31.870 --> 04:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
13.0 why do they think they're going to
 
04:29:38.429 --> 04:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:41.109 --> 04:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
again I don't remember do you have a
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
24 Chris do you don't have any I don't I
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
think the the trend up until this point
 
04:30:05.550 --> 04:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
for this year just was showing a decline
 
04:30:07.389 --> 04:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
on this is a revenue Source where
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
they've estimated 12 and a half to 13
 
04:30:12.109 --> 04:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
million period annually because the
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
number of gallons of beer being sold
 
04:30:18.030 --> 04:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
isn't changing it's the the types of
 
04:30:19.870 --> 04:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
things that fall into the beer category
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
that is changing so you had um like
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
micro breweries that were took off for a
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
while those took away from your standard
 
04:30:31.870 --> 04:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
alcoh uh beers like your Budweisers and
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
such more recently it's the the Blended
 
04:30:36.990 --> 04:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
drinks that they're um seen arise in
 
04:30:39.670 --> 04:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
people drinking that um and those don't
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
get taxed uh they do they they go they
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
go through um because of their alcohol
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
content they go through the beer
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
distributors and then they pay 30 cents
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:30:53.309 --> 04:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
Gown okay yeah represent you yeah I seem
 
04:30:55.389 --> 04:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
to recall conversations with them I
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
forget whether it was here but the beer
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
buying population now that now that they
 
04:31:04.349 --> 04:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
have the Blended
 
04:31:07.149 --> 04:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
drinks that would replace the mixed
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
drinks like a mimosa at a diner isn't
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
made with
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
well that's a bad one because that is
 
04:31:15.990 --> 04:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
made with champagne and beer and wine
 
04:31:18.429 --> 04:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
licenses go together but uh one of the
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
other mixed breakfast drinks is now made
 
04:31:23.389 --> 04:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
with a beer based product as opposed to
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
a liquor based product that they would
 
04:31:28.990 --> 04:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
need another higher tier license so
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
you're increasing your sales because of
 
04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
the anciliary products that are being
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
sold I that was one of the discussions
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
that was taking place because the
 
04:31:38.520 --> 04:31:39.630 align:start position:0%
that was taking place because the
current

04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
population tends to like
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
beer based stuff instead of alcohol
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
based stuff I don't know why I don't
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
recall them mentioning it in front of
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
the committee but they may have an yeah
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
I may had a moment where I zoned out
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I I put forward a be a bill to
 
04:31:56.590 --> 04:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
change their tax and thing and they said
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
no we can do it without changing
 
04:32:01.269 --> 04:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
anything if they buy and then they
 
04:32:01.279 --> 04:32:04.710 align:start position:0%
anything if they buy and then they
started

04:32:04.710 --> 04:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
marketing okay question yes thank you Mr
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
chairman so what what's the percentage
 
04:32:12.510 --> 04:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
cut off again for where if falls in the
 
04:32:14.060 --> 04:32:14.070 align:start position:0%
beers up below like
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
beers up below like
[Music]

04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
8% I I would have to check that to
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
confirm I'm not positive it's okay yeah
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
I just remember but it's around that
 
04:32:25.109 --> 04:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
it's around that this but I'd have to
 
04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
confirm it yeah that's okay it's been
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
adjusted over the years and I just buy
 
04:32:31.149 --> 04:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
what I can
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
buy thank you I remember something very
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
confusing uh about it's definitely 6%
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
for beer products and definitely 8% for
 
04:32:48.429 --> 04:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
liquor products in the other direction
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
and then in between it's mixed how how
 
04:32:53.950 --> 04:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
did they get to
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
that I can't answer that I have no idea
 
04:32:58.830 --> 04:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
how you know how that was we have to ask
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
Commerce because nobody else really
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%

Revenue
 
04:34:45.189 --> 04:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
column 7 uh 16
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
13.7 column 21
 
04:34:57.390 --> 04:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
column oh sorry oh gee I just wrote them

all in too well we'll get
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%
there let's do quick I like it I like it
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
let's do let's does next so that's
 
04:35:13.150 --> 04:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
column I yes um court fines we're doing

um so those those
 
04:35:25.230 --> 04:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
are again I think that's pretty
 
04:35:28.830 --> 04:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's pretty we agency uh
 
04:35:28.840 --> 04:35:29.869 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's pretty we agency uh
has

04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:35:29.879 --> 04:35:33.551 align:start position:0%
has
presented

yeah
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
okay so just so I can make sure it's
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
going to be 136 on row 11 137 on row 16
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
and 137 on row 21

and 137 on row 21
correct

04:35:52.910 --> 04:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
um do I have a
 
04:35:55.119 --> 04:35:58.150 align:start position:0%
um do I have a
second

04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%

made
 
04:37:43.150 --> 04:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
5050 all right that was 15 to zero

um okay so I believe correct me if I'm
 
04:37:48.670 --> 04:37:48.680 align:start position:0%

tomorrow um page three
column

04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
column
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
F insurance
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
tax um okay I won't fill numbers in yet
 
04:38:21.070 --> 04:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
because representative Aly wants to
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
debate so go
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
ahead well uh we have been hearing a lot
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
about catastrophic fires and
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
catastrophic uh
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
um Cyclones and things like that um and
 
04:38:41.789 --> 04:38:41.799 align:start position:0%
how the whole nation is going going to
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the increased costs of
 
04:38:47.070 --> 04:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
04:38:50.510 --> 04:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
agencies and
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
I when that has happened in the past a
 
04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
number of people have dropped their
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
insurance they thought it was just too
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
high and they probably wouldn't have to
 
04:39:03.400 --> 04:39:05.310 align:start position:0%
high and they probably wouldn't have to
use

04:39:05.310 --> 04:39:05.320 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:39:09.789 --> 04:39:09.799 align:start position:0%
it and I don't have numbers
 
04:39:14.830 --> 04:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
for for how much got affected in at
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
those times
 
04:39:20.429 --> 04:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
but for instance when uh Katrina took
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
out New
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
Orleans um but we've we've had
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
catastrophic floods over twice three
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
times in
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
Vermont that the insurers had to pay for
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
and and all of most of California has
 
04:39:42.750 --> 04:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
been been
 
04:39:45.270 --> 04:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
if it's true that we can't just pass
 
04:39:46.910 --> 04:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
that off on
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
California uh it's going to make
 
04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
Insurance a lot more
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
expensive for all of
 
04:39:58.510 --> 04:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
us yeah representative om yeah to follow
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
up on represent om's Point uh the impact
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
is Bel in New Hampshire because of the
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
reinsurance market yes so even though
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
the local insurance in California may be
 
04:40:11.628 --> 04:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
in deep trouble
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
most of that is uh most of that hit is
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
taken by the broader country from the
 
04:40:19.390 --> 04:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
reinsurance of these smaller companies
 
04:40:21.948 --> 04:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
and so we are de
 
04:40:21.958 --> 04:40:23.670 align:start position:0%
and so we are de
impacted

04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
04:40:26.350 --> 04:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh Chris
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
do we know if that's been considered in
 
04:40:30.430 --> 04:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
these numbers because I've heard the
 
04:40:33.310 --> 04:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
same thing so it's a it's a good point
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:38.550 --> 04:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
addressed I think what the commissioner
 
04:40:40.350 --> 04:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
had um discussed with the committee is
 
04:40:42.030 --> 04:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
that it's a
 
04:40:44.910 --> 04:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
a national issue and is being worked on
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
currently but I don't know how well it's
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
reflected in what they're seeing here or
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here sorry could we
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
check on that
 
04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
please we
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
can and if I could add we used to have a
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
continuity in Insurance
 
04:41:07.110 --> 04:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and I'm not sure I I know
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
that the person who is doing the most
 
04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
work on this retired three years ago and
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
she helped out the first
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
year she was a wi but um I don't know to
 
04:41:24.990 --> 04:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
what extent the current insurance
 
04:41:28.948 --> 04:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
commission is is talking with other
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners about what could be
 
04:41:32.560 --> 04:41:35.150 align:start position:0%
Commissioners about what could be
happening

04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:41:37.708 --> 04:41:37.718 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman as a
 
04:41:39.750 --> 04:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
point of information the last time this
 
04:41:42.270 --> 04:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
was brought up nationally
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh for uh the whole country to foot the
 
04:41:48.150 --> 04:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
bill was right after Katrina and then
 
04:41:51.990 --> 04:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
one Congressman uh woke up I don't know
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
which party it was and realized that
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
this was going to affect his State and
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
he spoke to everybody else and said why
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
are we going to protect private beach
 
04:42:05.948 --> 04:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
owners and it got killed very fast in
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
Congress I don't think there's going to
 
04:42:11.590 --> 04:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
be too much of a problem with that again
 
04:42:16.830 --> 04:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
this year uh for saving California it's
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
like you won't cut your brush back you
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
won't do this and that to uh clean up
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
your forests uh that's what
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
happens and that that is ignoring the
 
04:42:29.440 --> 04:42:30.910 align:start position:0%
happens and that that is ignoring the
reinsurance

04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
reinsurance
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
market as representative M was
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
explaining uh all of these insurance
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
companies most of these insurance
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
companies maybe all of them um
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
reinsure for
 
04:42:49.550 --> 04:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
guarantees they pay uh the the one in
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
London and we've got one here I think
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Insurance new insurance
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah on to insure them for their
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
losses and so when California has
 
04:43:09.830 --> 04:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
enormous losses they they are coming to
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
their reinsurers
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
to get uh compensated and when they do
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
that then the reinsurers have to go and
 
04:43:22.590 --> 04:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
put those costs on everybody else in
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
order to avoid
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
disappearing so represent Amy your point
 
04:43:30.670 --> 04:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
is that if insurance rates are going to
 
04:43:34.110 --> 04:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
go up then the insurance tax will will
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
go net will net more
 
04:43:41.590 --> 04:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I just more there were in
 
04:43:44.670 --> 04:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
the past uh a fair number of people who
 
04:43:46.270 --> 04:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
decided to go
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
naked no so then then that insurance
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that uh that was I think more in
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
health insurance but I'm not I'm not
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
sure I remember
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
correctly naked well it's probably
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
everything I mean if you can't afford
 
04:44:04.948 --> 04:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
something you can't afford it um one of
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
the things I just did was I looked at uh
 
04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the number here uh oh actually I used
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
the wrong number I used 150 I was trying
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
to see what the percent change was from
 
04:44:18.510 --> 04:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
2025 to
 
04:44:20.788 --> 04:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
2026 actually it's a big
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
change yeah I they're going to increase
 
04:44:25.550 --> 04:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
I used the high I used the high I should
 
04:44:27.910 --> 04:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
have used the 143 let me just do a quick
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
calculation here so uh that's a 16
 
04:44:34.230 --> 04:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's 16 over
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
143 16 /
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
143 that's uh 11.2 2% increase from 25
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
to 26 so I wonder if they're already
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
trying to take some of that into account
 
04:44:52.270 --> 04:44:52.280 align:start position:0%
you look the the other thing that
 
04:44:55.750 --> 04:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
affects our uh Property and Casualty
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is a large part of our insurance
 
04:45:04.628 --> 04:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh is that uh the Senate and its wisdom
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
when we were uh working on insurance a
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
number of years ago
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we were going to uh make all when
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
we were doing expanded
 
04:45:23.788 --> 04:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
medicaid on that we were going to tell
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies that they had to
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
this this medical insurance he
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
insurance they were going to have to pay
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
so in one year they paid two times what
 
04:45:47.230 --> 04:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
they would I'm sorry put your microphone
 
04:45:50.150 --> 04:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
on in one year they paid two times what
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
they should have paid had to pay and uh
 
04:45:57.948 --> 04:45:57.958 align:start position:0%
no it was a six Monon difference so uh
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
they had to pay it again in six months
 
04:46:02.110 --> 04:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
and then every year
 
04:46:07.628 --> 04:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
thereafter um they get on they've been
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
on a on a seesaw where one one year they
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
get more money the next year they get
 
04:46:16.310 --> 04:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
less money
 
04:46:16.320 --> 04:46:18.670 align:start position:0%
less money
doubled

04:46:18.670 --> 04:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
doubled
 
04:46:18.680 --> 04:46:20.350 align:start position:0%
doubled
uh

04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:46:24.788 --> 04:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
and and not knowing where they are in
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
that cycle at the moment makes it very
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
hard for us here to determine what's
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
actually they actually think is
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
happening but going up in a row each
 
04:46:43.230 --> 04:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so it's well I just want to
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
point out so the from
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
20 25 to 2026 as I said it was 11.2%
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
increase but from 26 to 27 it's only
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
about two and a half% increase um yeah
 
04:47:04.070 --> 04:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the second year after there's been
 
04:47:04.080 --> 04:47:05.110 align:start position:0%
and the second year after there's been
an

04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
increase in in the insurance tax to all
 
04:47:16.270 --> 04:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
of those companies on they come back and
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
if they've made more money than the year
 
04:47:24.470 --> 04:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
before uh then they have to make the
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
forward payment at Double that amount
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
that is increased then the next year if
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
things stabilize
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
back they have to they don't have to pay
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
more than half of of what on they can
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
reduce their their payments okay by that
 
04:47:49.628 --> 04:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
amount it's really it's it makes it
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult for us to calculate
 
04:47:55.390 --> 04:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and it was because the Senate
 
04:47:59.628 --> 04:47:59.638 align:start position:0%
didn't want us to have to pay pay up
 
04:48:02.548 --> 04:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
front for six months and they arranged
 
04:48:04.910 --> 04:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
to pay up
 
04:48:04.920 --> 04:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
to pay up
back

04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
Opel uh thank you Mr chair I I look I
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
think representative TIY is right about
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
Katrina and and the aftermath and that
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
but since then we've had you know other
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
devastating storms fires in California
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
the flooding and the completely
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
unprecedented impact of hurricanes in
 
04:48:35.390 --> 04:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
the Carolinas including Asheville um I I
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think at least for me um and I
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
apologize again I think I missed the
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner's original
 
04:48:44.670 --> 04:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
presentation I I I think there's enough
 
04:48:47.030 --> 04:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
uncertainty here that I I I would like
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
to ask this committee to invite the
 
04:48:51.150 --> 04:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department back to maybe
 
04:48:54.510 --> 04:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
address this specific issue before we
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
vote on a revenue estimate um there just
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
I think enough questions have been
 
04:49:02.470 --> 04:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
raised certainly for me um that I'm not
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
sure I feel comfortable voting on these
 
04:49:06.270 --> 04:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
numbers today without without getting
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
some more answers and and I'm sure Chris
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know representative or is ask ask
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
Chris to get the information I AB have
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
absolute faith that Chris could get that
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
information but I'd really kind of like
 
04:49:21.430 --> 04:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.440 --> 04:49:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
Department

04:49:23.830 --> 04:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
Department
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
rone oh sorry rone shamber uh just in
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
regard to the numbers that are on here
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh we have in 26 A 159 and in 27 a 163
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
is that the insurance tax yet their
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
a so if you're if you're looking at
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
their report yes just look at the line
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
above that you'll see that million
 
04:49:52.510 --> 04:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
dollar reduction each year yep that
 
04:49:54.628 --> 04:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
isn't in law yet that's a suggestion
 
04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
that the department has put it so we add
 
04:50:00.868 --> 04:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
that back in yep thank you and if if
 
04:50:02.350 --> 04:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
other people are looking at that same
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
sheet just to go along with what ripson
 
04:50:06.750 --> 04:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
Voli was saying if you follow from the
 
04:50:09.070 --> 04:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
Top Line you got the premium tax
 
04:50:12.070 --> 04:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
liability so that's what they collected
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
this year then you had the prepayment
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
that from the previous year which you
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
apply which is a negative number so
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
you'll see in I'll just use 26 they
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.948 --> 04:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
that um idea of a prepayment that they
 
04:50:44.708 --> 04:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
true up and then they get another
 
04:50:49.110 --> 04:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
prepayment um so I don't know how that
 
04:50:51.190 --> 04:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
truly they're able to look at the
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
national impact of some of what's being
 
04:50:54.990 --> 04:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
discussed here when they're doing this
 
04:50:56.830 --> 04:50:56.840 align:start position:0%
but I I think um I can either ask the
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
department the question or if the
 
04:50:59.948 --> 04:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
committee wants them to come back we can
 
04:51:01.470 --> 04:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
try to find a day with the chair to
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
bring them back
 
04:51:06.990 --> 04:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Al me and then ORS
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think if we all can find that
 
04:51:13.868 --> 04:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
sheet that was the insurance
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
Department's um input or go to your
 
04:51:21.910 --> 04:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
website where we'll find it and see the
 
04:51:26.110 --> 04:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
zigzag that goes on in the the insurance
 
04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
tax normally uh we still have the issue
 
04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
of what's going to happen with the the
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
major increase in catastrophes this year
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
inside the United
 
04:51:40.830 --> 04:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
States Representative boards thank you
 
04:51:44.670 --> 04:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so Chris and representative
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
of opal has a good point uh do you feel
 
04:51:49.548 --> 04:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
that if you went back and ask the
 
04:51:52.110 --> 04:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
Insurance Group whatever it is uh
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not their estimates are
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
accurate or they need to take another
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
look at them they give you an answer
 
04:51:58.628 --> 04:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
what do you think are they going to be
 
04:52:01.708 --> 04:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
able to are you going to trust their
 
04:52:03.788 --> 04:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
answer oh that's kind of a loaded
 
04:52:03.798 --> 04:52:05.110 align:start position:0%
answer oh that's kind of a loaded
question

04:52:05.110 --> 04:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
yeah in other words go
 
04:52:09.670 --> 04:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
ahead the answer is I'm going to trust
 
04:52:10.990 --> 04:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
what they're reporting to because I
 
04:52:12.670 --> 04:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
don't know better myself it's not not an
 
04:52:15.670 --> 04:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
area that I'm have expertise in um but
 
04:52:18.310 --> 04:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
what I I can get an answer to a question
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
I think the real question the committee
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
has is will that answer lead to other
 
04:52:23.390 --> 04:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
questions that you would need the
 
04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
department here to answer for you or
 
04:52:26.910 --> 04:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
would you be satisfied with the answer
 
04:52:28.830 --> 04:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
that I was able to provide that they
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
gave me yeah have well let me just yeah
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah I wasn't trying to set you up
 
04:52:35.470 --> 04:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
obviously but I mean having done this
 
04:52:37.510 --> 04:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
stuff on and off my whole life if you
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
will so I mean if I bring my if I went
 
04:52:41.470 --> 04:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
and talk to my people and they get and I
 
04:52:42.990 --> 04:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
said are these numbers still good and
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
they said yes I'd go with it if they
 
04:52:47.230 --> 04:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
said no then I you know you should have
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
been talking to me already but okay
 
04:52:51.310 --> 04:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
whatever you guys decide will'll be good
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
with me but thank you representative
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
erery I just a reminder to the committee
 
04:52:58.990 --> 04:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
that uh these numbers are preliminary at
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%
this point uh we're just beginning the
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
work uh and they will change in March
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
and April and May and
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
June uh because we're to spend at least
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
one maybe two days going over these
 
04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
things again I would draw the
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to the uh official
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
plan which was 4 140 um I believe wasn't
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
it yep and then the uh preliminaries are
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:40.110 --> 04:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
23 the 163 was a combination of factors
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
in increase cost of each of our
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
individual policies uh be it auto
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
insurance or health insurance or home
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
insurance well of all of our
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
insurances and inflation and the value
 
04:53:59.310 --> 04:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
apportionment of certain of our vehicles
 
04:54:02.510 --> 04:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
and homes um so that's one reason that
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
that took place um The increased plan
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
for the other ones are mod are large but
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
there are modest
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
increases related to the initial bump
 
04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
that took place last fiscal year or this
 
04:54:22.510 --> 04:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
still so I'm not worried about the
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
numbers right now we will have a chance
 
04:54:29.830 --> 04:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
to look at them I don't think we need
 
04:54:32.350 --> 04:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
another uh thing to come in I think we
 
04:54:34.590 --> 04:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
start with these numbers and then we
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
take a look at what's going on as far as
 
04:54:38.948 --> 04:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
the reinsurance in New Hampshire there
 
04:54:41.310 --> 04:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
was once a very large ational insurance
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
company called New Hampshire Insurance
 
04:54:47.708 --> 04:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
Group which was bought out by AIG AIG is
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
I believe Swiss group now and it's
 
04:54:54.910 --> 04:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
International so this recent storm that
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
just hit Northern England or northern
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
Europe we're going to be paying perhaps
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
pennies perhaps a dollar uh of that cost
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
because the way insurance has always
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
been set up ever since they started
 
04:55:14.628 --> 04:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
started serving tea at Lloyd's tea house
 
04:55:20.270 --> 04:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.750 --> 04:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
explanation I would like to see some
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
evidence that they are uh Consulting the
 
04:55:29.400 --> 04:55:30.990 align:start position:0%
evidence that they are uh Consulting the
National

04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
National
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh Association or whatever
 
04:55:34.440 --> 04:55:35.628 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh Association or whatever
it's

04:55:35.628 --> 04:55:35.638 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
called about uh how
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
much they think that is going to impact
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
us that's fine the commissioner did say
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
that the all the insurance Commissioners
 
04:55:49.910 --> 04:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
from around the state are part of that
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
organization and that meet on a regular
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
basis to discuss issues and try to um
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
normalize I guess is the word I'll use
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's the right word but
 
04:56:01.230 --> 04:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
to try to have some similarities in the
 
04:56:03.390 --> 04:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
way that insurance is run in each state
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
not to say it's exactly the same but to
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit easier for some of
 
04:56:09.470 --> 04:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
the insurance providers to go from state
 
04:56:11.548 --> 04:56:11.558 align:start position:0%
to state so there is that I don't know
 
04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
if that specific question has been
 
04:56:15.548 --> 04:56:15.558 align:start position:0%
discussed I would assume yes but I can
 
04:56:19.150 --> 04:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
ask the department for sure yeah
 
04:56:21.990 --> 04:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah representative ulry yeah
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that New Hampshire
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
also participates in a little known
 
04:56:30.590 --> 04:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
unpublicized group of uh law compliance
 
04:56:33.470 --> 04:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
that uh tries to make the laws conform
 
04:56:38.548 --> 04:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
one to another in each state um and we
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
part of it it's about five people that
 
04:56:43.948 --> 04:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
are all got initials after their names
 
04:56:46.590 --> 04:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
for some reason and no one knows what
 
04:56:52.110 --> 04:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
works all right you know I I yeah that
 
04:56:58.350 --> 04:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
was quite an explanation you
 
04:57:01.708 --> 04:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
gave and Jordan yeah that was quite an
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
explanation you I hate to have you know
 
04:57:05.548 --> 04:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
I hate to have to agree with you I I
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
just want to go on
 
04:57:11.868 --> 04:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
record all right so um um Chris you're
 
04:57:13.830 --> 04:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
going to check with the insurance
 
04:57:16.430 --> 04:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
department to see um are they
 
04:57:18.430 --> 04:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with these numbers and did
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
they take into account or take into
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
account or do do the latest events in
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
California for
 
04:57:30.270 --> 04:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
instance affect us um my my guess is
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
that my guess is they've they've this is
 
04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
what they do I'm sure they've they've
 
04:57:37.628 --> 04:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
looked at it but we'll we'll hold off on
 
04:57:40.270 --> 04:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
voting for this hopefully um you know we
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
get an
 
04:57:41.200 --> 04:57:43.190 align:start position:0%
get an
answer

04:57:43.190 --> 04:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:57:43.200 --> 04:57:45.830 align:start position:0%
answer
um

04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:49.708 --> 04:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
soon uh question what happened in
 
04:57:53.708 --> 04:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
Ashville Asheville oh Asheville thought
 
04:57:53.718 --> 04:57:56.230 align:start position:0%
Ashville Asheville oh Asheville thought
you

04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
said no it's ribs in Nashville Furniture
 
04:57:59.520 --> 04:58:03.190 align:start position:0%
said no it's ribs in Nashville Furniture
in

04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:05.548 --> 04:58:05.558 align:start position:0%
Asheville it's all over
 
04:58:05.558 --> 04:58:07.310 align:start position:0%
Asheville it's all over
that

04:58:07.310 --> 04:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's not a PR I me
 
04:58:13.670 --> 04:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
okay let's um getting close to three
 
04:58:15.948 --> 04:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
o'clock let's try to finish up here we
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
have one more one more column to look at
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
right now and that's column D liquor
 
04:58:26.990 --> 04:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
transfer and um so column
 
04:58:32.190 --> 04:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
101.7 um column uh I'm sorry row 16
 
04:58:41.628 --> 04:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
102.9 and row 21 102. three and
 
04:58:44.190 --> 04:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
representative jewelry yeah I think the
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
agency's numbers in this case uh their
 
04:58:49.470 --> 04:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
General history after the Reformation of
 
04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
uh 20 what was that 10 9 10 when we
 
04:58:55.470 --> 04:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
changed it the board structure and
 
04:58:59.910 --> 04:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:03.628 --> 04:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
real very very accurate uh regarding
 
04:59:05.548 --> 04:59:05.558 align:start position:0%
their numbers and their projections of
 
04:59:07.948 --> 04:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
their Market they now have a marketing
 
04:59:11.270 --> 04:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
team on board that uh looks at the in
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
economy and figures out how much we can
 
04:59:24.470 --> 04:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
something well somebody want to make a
 
04:59:31.390 --> 04:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
seconds um any further discussion on
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
these numbers on under column D liquor
 
04:59:44.430 --> 04:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
transfer seeing yes represent El me
 
04:59:47.110 --> 04:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to check this is after all the
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
things that the legis keeps
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
Al it it is it's the uh the net number
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
so they they've tried to adjust for the
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
transfer to the governor's alcohol
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
commission fund as well as the money
 
05:00:01.868 --> 05:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
that goes to granted Advantage which is
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid expansion fund um there is
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
always the opportunity for Department of
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to come
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
forward and ask for More Liquor funds
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
because that's the way the statute is
 
05:00:13.708 --> 05:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
written um but they didn't anticipate
 
05:00:15.948 --> 05:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
any more than what they've accounted
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
for okay anybody
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
else all right seeing n all in favor
 
05:00:25.548 --> 05:00:25.558 align:start position:0%
accepting uh liquor transfer as we just
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
discussed any opposed seeing none 15 to
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
zero um okay so I think let's take a
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
quick look I think that concludes so um
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we will not necessarily we'll
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
see how much progress we make but we are
 
05:00:45.430 --> 05:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
working on this
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh from in the morning roughly 10 to 12
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
and then um in the afternoon say roughly
 
05:00:55.548 --> 05:00:55.558 align:start position:0%
1 to two to three somewhere in there and
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
then we're executing four bills I put in
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
the calendar as you probably notice 2
 
05:01:01.868 --> 05:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
o'clock just in case we get to a point
 
05:01:03.708 --> 05:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
where we feel like you know we're we're
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
done and I didn't want to have to wait
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
till 3 just to exec things I would um so
 
05:01:11.470 --> 05:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
basically as I look at this let's see
 
05:01:14.470 --> 05:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
column so we what we have left is total
 
05:01:17.628 --> 05:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
business taxes rooms and meals
 
05:01:20.150 --> 05:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
tobacco well interest in dividends I
 
05:01:22.350 --> 05:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
guess that will be oh that's that's
 
05:01:26.030 --> 05:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
really a difficult one that's um that's
 
05:01:26.040 --> 05:01:27.750 align:start position:0%
really a difficult one that's um that's
fairly

05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
05:01:29.390 --> 05:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
straightforward well we'll do that
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when Chris has that filled in
 
05:01:33.910 --> 05:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
because we did get some numbers today uh
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
Communications tax real estate
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
transfer um
 
05:01:44.590 --> 05:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
fees Lottery we did Lottery and then the
 
05:01:52.110 --> 05:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
last one would be utility property tax
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
we already did we did Highway and we did
 
05:01:58.270 --> 05:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
fishing okay
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
good anybody have uh any
 
05:02:03.868 --> 05:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
questions just one quick comment on the
 
05:02:05.230 --> 05:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends um the
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner gave you the 25 number at
 
05:02:09.548 --> 05:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
1343 so that's the number you won't see
 
05:02:11.948 --> 05:02:11.958 align:start position:0%
a high low for interest in dividends
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
05:02:16.310 --> 05:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
134.5 for both the high and the low
 
05:02:20.190 --> 05:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
number oh her document has a um a high
 
05:02:21.750 --> 05:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
and a low range but when she was
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
testifying in front of you today with
 
05:02:25.868 --> 05:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
her presentation she said that 25 will
 
05:02:25.878 --> 05:02:26.830 align:start position:0%
her presentation she said that 25 will
be

05:02:26.830 --> 05:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
134.5 and then you would reduce um down
 
05:02:30.480 --> 05:02:31.310 align:start position:0%
134.5 and then you would reduce um down
to

05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:34.830 --> 05:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
8.7 in 26 and 0 and
 
05:02:37.628 --> 05:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
27 okay well so I just I'm going to put
 
05:02:38.830 --> 05:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
it that's how I'm going to reflect it
 
05:02:40.470 --> 05:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not a suggesting do anything with it
 
05:02:44.830 --> 05:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
today yeah okay sounds good all right
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
that's it for today then thank you
 
05:02:50.030 --> 05:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
