i was not expecting to introduce this
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill so i very much apologize uh
 
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.790 align:start position:0%
bill so i very much apologize uh
so

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor drafted this bill
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
to prohibit state or local government
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
agencies from requiring masks or other
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
facial coverings in response to cova-19
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
or other infectious diseases that's part
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
one of the bill
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
it amends 141c which is the um
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
infection communicable disease chapter
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
um basically not allowing mass mandates
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
of any kind
 
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
of any kind
um

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:14.550 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
um also to prevent state or local
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
government agencies from issuing
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
immunity passports are similar
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
standardized documentation of cobit 19
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
basically

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
preventing any state or local
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.870 align:start position:0%
requirement to
prove

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
prove
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
that you've been vaccinated for cova 19.
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
and also part three prohibiting
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
businesses from requiring documentation
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
of covid19 vaccination statuses so that
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
supplies to any
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
goods facilities advantages privileges
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
licensing educational opportunities
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
and prevents employers from
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
refusing employers from refusing
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
employment to anyone
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
for failure to produce evidence of
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
coping 19 vaccination
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination from public accommodation
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
any public-facing business
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
they can't keep people out based on
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
you think very well on your feet you
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ever happen to run into
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
sometimes

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
since you're a co-sponsor would you uh
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
take some questions yes
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative canarch
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you did a great job
 
00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:13.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you did a great job
for

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
hearing about having to do it 30 seconds
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
before you did it um but i do have a
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
question it comes down to what we've
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
already discussed in some of the other
 
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.550 align:start position:0%
already discussed in some of the other
bills

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh lines 20 uh 7-29
 
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.150 align:start position:0%
uh lines 20 uh 7-29
uh

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
have been superseded by the supreme
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
court ruling regarding the cms mandate
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
for health care facilities and obviously
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
this bill was written way back in
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
september long before we knew that was
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to come down
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
but would you agree that that part needs
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
to therefore be removed from this bill
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
because of the impact it will have upon
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh basically the closure of
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
almost all of our healthcare facilities
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
so i've actually been doing some
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
research on that and
 
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.069 align:start position:0%
research on that and
um

00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
i i've spoken with the 10th amendment
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
center and i also spoke with um
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
some people in florida where they passed
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
a bill um
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
that allowed for broad exemptions
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
um to employer mandate so an exemption
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
could be a potential amendment to change
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
this to an exemption clause that just
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
provides a simple
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
exemption process whereas now when
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
people apply for a religious or medical
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
exemption they're kind of
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
being put through a arduous
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
process where they're
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
facing kind of a lot of
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
resistance and the employers are just
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
trying to tire them out and or turning
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
it into a religious inquisition
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
um so it would have essentially the same
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
effect at least someone who has a
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
conscientious objection or
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
is immune to covid that's that's kind of
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
how the florida law is written
 
00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.509 align:start position:0%
how the florida law is written
um

00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
but even if we were to pass like a
 
00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
but even if we were to pass like a
straight

00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
straight
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
um mandate ban like this bill proposes
 
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.750 align:start position:0%
um mandate ban like this bill proposes
um

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
the idea that the federal government
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
take the money from our hospitals is
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that would actually
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
that they would go that far
 
00:12:15.839 --> 00:12:16.790 align:start position:0%
that they would go that far
um

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
i think that it would come down to
 
00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.150 align:start position:0%
i think that it would come down to
how

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.829 align:start position:0%
how
um

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
how strongly the state
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
stands on its right to
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislate and have its laws
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
compared to a federal rule
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know i think that a state
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
a legislatively passed law would hold
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
more standing than a federal rule
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh if you when reading the supreme court
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
decision on that particular part the cms
 
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.949 align:start position:0%
decision on that particular part the cms
mandate

00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
they explicitly made the point that the
 
00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:53.670 align:start position:0%
they explicitly made the point that the
for

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid that the federal
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
government is paying the bill well half
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
of medicaid got it they pay the bill and
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
therefore they have the right to
 
00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
be able to place reasonable restrictions
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
for the use of the money that they're
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
giving because they're trying to protect
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
the patients
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
so do we have the authority to
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
contra man that or do we have does the
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
cms mandate
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
dictate how the exemptions work that
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
part i do not know it doesn't um
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
it only specifies that there are medical
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions but in florida
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
they have other exemptions and they have
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
not had any issues
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
thank you leah um
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
would this bill have to have any kind of
 
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.910 align:start position:0%
would this bill have to have any kind of
amendment

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%
amendment
to

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
do what uh florida has done which is
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
make the uh
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
make the uh
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
request for exemptions less onerous
 
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
there would have to be amendment because
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
right now it just says um
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
that they may not so like it could be a
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
carve out just for the cms
 
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
carve out just for the cms
but

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
even that is only theoretical because
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
technically florida's law goes against
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
what the cms regulations dictate and
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
they have not had any issue with cms
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
certification being revoked or
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
refusal to pay to pay by the federal
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
government and i think that
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
when it comes down to it that the
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
federal government is not going to close
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative cushman for taking my
 
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.710 align:start position:0%
representative cushman for taking my
question

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.069 align:start position:0%
 
would

00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
you not you personally but would the
 
00:14:55.829 --> 00:14:55.839 align:start position:0%
state be willing to financially support
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and defense in the event
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
that the federal government did in fact
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
stop sending the money to the state
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
would the state be willing to fund the
 
00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:04.949 align:start position:0%
would the state be willing to fund the
coffers

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
coffers
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
so that hospitals would not be in peril
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
to not be able to provide patient care
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that is a good question of which i do
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
with a question
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
i have one what about
 
00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:25.030 align:start position:0%
i have one what about
um

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
a little mom and pop shop
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
where either mom or pop or both
 
00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.110 align:start position:0%
where either mom or pop or both
are

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
getting a little older and have a few
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
health concerns and
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
they have three or four employees and
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
they just don't want to get sick
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
this bill would say
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
they will it will be illegal for them to
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
say you got to get
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
if you're going to keep working here is
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh that is correct
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
however under federal law already
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
no business can
 
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.509 align:start position:0%
no business can
deny

00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
deny
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
medical religious exemptions already um
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
employee of a business with one in one
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
employer and one employee
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that one employee
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
submits a request for religious
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
accommodation or a request for
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
disability accommodation under federal
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
law they already have to grant it the
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
issue that we're having is not really
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
with the small businesses small
 
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.470 align:start position:0%
with the small businesses small
businesses

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
typically have been accommodating and
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
not turning it into a arduous process
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
really what we've seen a lot is the
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
larger corporate entities
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
who have teams of lawyers at their
 
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.350 align:start position:0%
who have teams of lawyers at their
disposal

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
disposal
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
writing their exemption policies to
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
sidestep that federal process for
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
exemption so really
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
the point is that no business can really
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
say that a hundred percent of their
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
employees need to be
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they can make the process for
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
exemption dif more difficult or less
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
difficult but
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
there is always that civil rights
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
act of 1964 exception
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
another question is under the religious
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
exemption i'm thinking back to
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
the time of the vietnam war when people
 
00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.710 align:start position:0%
the time of the vietnam war when people
would

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
want to be conscientious objectors on
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
religious grounds and it's quite
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
understood that
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
people who were members of the historic
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
peace churches
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
if they raised a conscientious objection
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
that was quite easy because they
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
belonged to a so-called peace church
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
but somebody who did not belong to who
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
belonged to a different kind of church
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
and in fact had no difficulty with the
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
korean war or world war ii now just
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go to vietnam it was very
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
very difficult for the religious
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
exemption card to be played
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
is the drift in this bill
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
such that the religious
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
it is hoped that the religious exemption
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
is now much much broader
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
well this actually doesn't speak to
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
religious exemption at all it just says
 
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:08.789 align:start position:0%
religious exemption at all it just says
that

00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
anybody for any reason does not have to
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
be forced to take a vaccine
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
thanks i think i'll save it for the
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
exact session thank you
 
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.549 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.950 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
who is representing herself and supports
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
the bill and wishes to speak for three
 
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:55.270 align:start position:0%
the bill and wishes to speak for three
minutes

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is laurie ordolano
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
i live in nashua i didn't prepare
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
testimony because i didn't anticipate i
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
was going to speak but as i looked at
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
these bills i thought
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
i'd pitch in a little um i'm really a
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
person who enjoys choice and um
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
believe choice is very important and i'm
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
here in support of these bills because
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
the other choice it seems like there's a
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
lot of bills that go on the other side
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
i'm more opposed to than this
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
but i feel as though we're still
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislating too much from fear
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
from a space of fear and we're
 
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:32.789 align:start position:0%
from a space of fear and we're
we're

00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
not recognizing
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
and gathering the kind of data and
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the type of data we should be
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
looking at in response to this
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know i've come a long way i masked
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
like a maniac
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
i had a mask on three weeks before mass
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
were called for because my husband ran a
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
company in china and what was going on
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
over there was um
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
so difficult and i was talking to a lot
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
of his chinese workers and you know they
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
were all about getting a mask on so mask
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
went on me when i was walking through
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
the market i was the only person wearing
 
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.430 align:start position:0%
the market i was the only person wearing
one

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.789 align:start position:0%
one
and

00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know i've come a long way in reading
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
and learning and studying and feeling as
 
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
and learning and studying and feeling as
though

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
that fear was not justified fully in the
 
00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.549 align:start position:0%
that fear was not justified fully in the
beginning

00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i think our data has always
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
supported that this is an a disease that
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
affected a segment of the pr population
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
most heavily the older people
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
but we reacted as if we needed a care
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
policy that treated people from zero to
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
a hundred
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
with the same regulations and
 
00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:39.190 align:start position:0%
with the same regulations and
restrictions

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that's been a big error
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
i come from a city that closed the
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
public schools for 13 months longer than
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
anyone i believe in the state the impact
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
to our kids has been devastating
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
and our our teachers are pushing to
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
close again right now
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
this is enormously difficult for parents
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
and all the private schools in our area
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
are allowing choice
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
when the catholic school a half a mile
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
from me opened
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
i thought in the fall with choice
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
masking choice i thought they would have
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
a big problem
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
and and it seemed as though 80 90
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
percent of the parents were sending
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
their kids without masks it was high i
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
was shocked i said these schools are
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
going to close
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
they never did
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
they worked they came through it just
 
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.110 align:start position:0%
they worked they came through it just
fine

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
the public schools with a full mask
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
policy had to close
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
for days
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
elevated sickness
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
and teacher shortages that were you know
 
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.149 align:start position:0%
and teacher shortages that were you know
ridiculous

00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
400 teachers out
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know why that's happening
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
but i know that choice is very important
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
and my husband runs a a good-sized
 
00:21:52.799 --> 00:21:54.390 align:start position:0%
and my husband runs a a good-sized
company

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
with employees all over the world
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
and he never instituted a policy for his
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
employees because he had a lot of young
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
people the older people took the vaccine
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
the younger people didn't want to
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
and he didn't feel comfortable mandating
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
it because he really wasn't 100 percent
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
certain he understood the risks
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
his company came through it beautifully
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
and the younger people recovered quickly
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
they were forced to stay out the 10 days
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
they had an awesome remote system for
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
working so they maintained profitability
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
they had the highest profit
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
returns for the last two years than they
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
ever had he never thought he'd grow his
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
company the way he did because remote
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
remote working enhanced his business a
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
great deal and when his employees were
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
out they kept plugging
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
i mean the day coveted hit he set up a
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
remote workstation and he worked at 8-10
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
hour day that day
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
and he put all his employees on it he
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
never missed a day
 
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:51.860 align:start position:0%
never missed a day
um

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:51.870 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm very concerned about
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know these types of bills both ways
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
that push a one-size-fits-all protocol
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
for every segment of the population
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think data is starting to show us
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
particularly from europe
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we have probably made some mistakes
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
and we have a medical system that is
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
driven by profit unlike european
 
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.029 align:start position:0%
driven by profit unlike european
countries

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
countries
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
we have to be very careful about this
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
and considering what we
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know what's going on here so i would
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
just urge a tremendous amount of caution
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful deliberations in an open
 
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.110 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful deliberations in an open
mind

mind
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
and no judgment
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
um you know no shaming
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
just uh recognize that we've all been
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
through a lot
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
and uh my opinions are very thoughtful
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions on towns or cities being
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
able to determine whether or not a mask
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
requirement will be imposed in that city
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
or town
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
restrictions on state government
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
entities being able to certify an
 
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
individual's covid vaccination status
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting private businesses in the
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
state to require verification of their
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination status and prohibiting
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccination status
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
needless to say a very broad and
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
far-reaching bill a piece of legislation
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to the entire bill but we
 
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.430 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to the entire bill but we
focus

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
focus
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
i will focus my comments today on the
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
sections that would impact our member
 
00:25:39.679 --> 00:25:41.190 align:start position:0%
sections that would impact our member
hospitals

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
as private employers
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
as i think a lot of you know the
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
hospital association and its member
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals announced in august of last
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
year a consensus statement in support of
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
requiring our health care workforce to
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
be vaccinated against covid in odor in
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
order to protect the health and safety
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
of our patients our staff and our
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
communities hospitals have announced
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
their own individual policies and have
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
been implementing them with robust
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
education for their staff
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
about the important benefits of vaccine
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
in doing so hospitals have sought to be
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
flexible and have complied
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
with all relevant state and federal
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines including offering medical
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
and religious exemptions
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
um the decision to require their
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
employees to be vaccinated against covid
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
was done to ensure the health and safety
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
of their patients their workforce and
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
their communities they have seen first
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
hand the devastation that covet 19 can
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
have on their patients especially those
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
that are unvaccinated
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals have an inherent
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect the health and
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
safety of their patients who by their
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
very nature are very ill and the covid19
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine is the most effective way we can
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
we can do that requiring vaccines of
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
health care workers from communicable
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
diseases is not new for hospitals in new
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospitals have required
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinations against several
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
communicable and deadly diseases such as
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
mumps measles rubella chickenpox
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
diphtheria tetanus
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
pertussis and influenza as a condition
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
of employment with the same type of
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
medical and religious exempt exemptions
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
now allowed for under covert 19 vaccine
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
we believe it is absolutely the right
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
thing to do for the health and safety of
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
our patients our staff and the citizens
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
furthermore to make such a vaccination
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirement and unlawful discriminatory
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
practice as stated in this legislation
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
would have a chilling effect on
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
employers in the state of new hampshire
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
not to mention an increase in lawsuits
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
as stated in the fiscal note the cost to
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state if this bill were were to be
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
passed is significant for all these
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
reasons we are opposed to house bill 224
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
share my views with you any questions
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
for ms minahan and thank you for coming
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
and sharing
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative lyon thank you mr
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
again today
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
my question is there are other states
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
where hospitals have employees who are
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and covet positive working is
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
that something that new hospitals in new
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire would do
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
to allow coveted positive physician
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare practitioners to work in
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
order to fill the gaps
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
the hospitals have a workforce shortage
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
and a number of staff have been out due
 
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.590 align:start position:0%
and a number of staff have been out due
to

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
coming down with kovid
 
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.630 align:start position:0%
coming down with kovid
breakthrough

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
breakthrough
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
cases and they have been
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
out because of that
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
as far as how long they have been out
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
before they're able to come back i
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
believe they're following the cdc
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines relative to that okay thank
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
you follow up yes yes thank you um and
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up if policy ever allows
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
covet active
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
coveted positive employees to work would
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
you loosen the backs would you be in
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
favor of loosening the vaccination
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
requirement if we are having healthcare
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
professionals who are coveted positive
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
working in our new hampshire hospitals
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
um i i can't really answer that
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
hypothetical question
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
by i will follow up on that by which you
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
mean you haven't thought it through or
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're not prepared to tell us
 
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.389 align:start position:0%

i
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
am have not thought that through so i do
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
not feel that i'm able to answer that
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
question at this time
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%

institutions in this country
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
cleveland clinic
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
placed on
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%

unvaccinated employees
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
i was not aware of that
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
that that is i have uh colleagues at
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
cleveland clinic where it comes from
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
um a quick follow-up thank you mr
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
chairman and
um

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
did you have any notice that some
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
organizations such as cleveland clinic
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
this is new today
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
have clamped down on a medical
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
exemptions for vaccination and are
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
basically not
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
allowing almost any of them
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
i can only speak to what my experience
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
is in new hampshire with our hospitals
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is from
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
not every single hospital has fully
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
implemented their policies but they have
 
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.389 align:start position:0%
implemented their policies but they have
been

00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
generous and and working with the
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
employees to try to work through
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
if they request a medical or a religious
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
exemption and the fact is that we have
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
about one percent of staff that actually
 
00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.029 align:start position:0%
about one percent of staff that actually
um

00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
were affected if they did not um receive
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
an exemption um and were um
 
00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:08.149 align:start position:0%
an exemption um and were um
were

00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
were not able to remain in in employment
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
you want to learn from you you're
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
welcome representative folsom
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
taking the question um can you please
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
describe um i know it's going to be kind
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
a broad description but can you please
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
describe the typical uh process someone
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
has to go through
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
for a medical exemption or a religious
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
exemption for having um not taking the
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
vaccine there is a process there is a
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
committee um it varies by hospital these
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.029 align:start position:0%
are not
mandated

00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
processes each each facility goes
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
through but again they've been as i as
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
my testimony indicated they have been
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
had these in place for influenza and
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
other required vaccinations for years so
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
there is a policy that the hospitals
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
have and an individual does go through
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
that process and there is a committee
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
that reviews those um and i think for
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
medical it's obviously a little
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
different than religious but again they
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
do have
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
those in place it is not one individual
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
making this decision
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
it is a committee yes to follow up um
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
i think um i probably didn't ask it very
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
well but what does the
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
employee have to provide to this
 
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.230 align:start position:0%
employee have to provide to this
committee

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
during this process
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
do they have to have signs
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
slips from doctors do they have to show
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
their medical records do they have to
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
have something signed by their
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
pastor priest or or whatever i will need
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
to get back to you i don't know exactly
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
what they have to submit um i don't
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
believe medical records are necessary i
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
think there's a physician um at a
 
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
think there's a physician um at a
station

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
station
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.389 align:start position:0%
station
required

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
but as far as on the religious side i i
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
would need to get a little bit more
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
information for you which i'm happy to
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
any further questions for mrs minahan
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
taking my questions i actually have
 
00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:21.669 align:start position:0%
taking my questions i actually have
three

00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
okay the first one is
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
are the hospitals willing to accept the
 
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.830 align:start position:0%
are the hospitals willing to accept the
liability

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
for employees when they suffer
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
the second question i'll let her answer
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
the first one please thank you
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
um there is a um
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
a law that was passed last year that
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
addresses that so um
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think that that
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
kind of speaks for itself
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
for those of us who don't remember what
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
that was even though we were part of it
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
i need to look it up to be honest i have
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
this year's bills in my head but i will
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
i will find it i claim exemption on the
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
basis of age
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
i'm right there i'm with i'm right there
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
with you i'm not so sure
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative gay number two please
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
when are you going to permit the usage
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
of old-time medicines that have been
 
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.710 align:start position:0%
of old-time medicines that have been
proven

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
proven
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
effective in over
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
160 trials
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
clinical trials worldwide
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
i don't believe i'm
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
capable or
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer that question
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
number three
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
what is the new hampshire association
 
00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:41.829 align:start position:0%
what is the new hampshire association
policy

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
as my i believe my testimony in um
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
various bills in front of this committee
 
00:34:53.589 --> 00:34:53.599 align:start position:0%
um the hospitals support the
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations um and again follow cdc
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines that say vaccinations even if
 
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
you have already had covid are
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
superior to
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
not being vaccinated
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
what policy are you what studies are you
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
the decisions being made about people
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
having natural immunity as opposed to
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
simply having a vaccine i do understand
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
that currently the policy the
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
opinion is at least by some people that
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
having had covet and having natural
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
immunity and having a vaccine
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
is rated the best protection
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
but that's not what the hospitals
 
00:35:39.839 --> 00:35:41.270 align:start position:0%
but that's not what the hospitals
require

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
so are they going to adopt those similar
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
studies that say people who have a
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
natural immunity have superior
 
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.510 align:start position:0%
natural immunity have superior
protection

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
that is a question for our clinicians
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
that i would need to
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
talk with them about that question thank
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
many of you for taking my question
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have a long history in the state i
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
think also in this country you're trying
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
to allow business owners to run the
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
business they wait they think it should
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
be run
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
does this in fact in your opinion
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
infringe upon that right for the
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
business owner to run the business the
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
way they want to and enjoy the fruits of
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
their labor yes i agree with that
 
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:32.710 align:start position:0%
their labor yes i agree with that
statement

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative leon thank
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
i found the law that was passed last
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
year it provides liability for any
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
hospital who's operating and complying
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
with any
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
with any executive order agency order or
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
rule including but not limited to
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
waivers from cms
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
and the department of health and human
 
00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
and the department of health and human
services

00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
so as long as you're as long as the
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals are complying with any of
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
these rules their liability is protected
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
against vaccine injury against anything
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
else but it does not appear to limit the
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
liability for anything
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
if the hospitals are not following any
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
of those rules or guidelines do you
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
think that that's influencing the policy
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
and do you think that that is the state
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
dictating how the hospitals practice
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%

widespread vaccination including both

the freedom to make these decisions
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
should be left up to those entities
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
state government should not prevent

providers now more than ever need the
flexibility

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
and for the health of their employees
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
clients and patients so we asked the
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee to vote in expedient to
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislate i do have um written testimony
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
that i'll leave with you
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and while that's coming around
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
just a quick when you mentioned um that
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of needing to be nimble
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
to sorry to be able to respond um
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the businesses but would you agree
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
that in general it is a bad policy to
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
place into statute
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
how public health officials will respond
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
because this applies not just to covet
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
19 but to other infectious diseases
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
could this be a problem if we face
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
something else and we're not able to
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
respond in an appropriate fashion
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative i completely agree i did
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
work at the division of public health
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
services at some point in time and i do
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
know that you um things are ever
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
changing you have to be fluid so i would
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
agree with you that you need that
 
00:40:49.359 --> 00:40:54.710 align:start position:0%
agree with you that you need that
flexibility

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
taking the question um i appreciate that
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
you're trying to respect these rights of
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
these businesses
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if you know that there's a
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
certain point with corporations and
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
other businesses where because of how
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
they work with the state they're
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
actually trading off their own personal
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
risk and do you think that weighs into
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they need to appreciate
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
the personal risk of their employees and
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
customers for that trade-off for
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
protection from the state thank you for
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
the question representative um
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i can't answer that
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
question i'm not um
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in employees and risk i'm
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
sure there are a lot of people who are
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the question thank you
 
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the question thank you

thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
my question um we've heard how
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals often require other vaccines
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
up front
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
but if you are going to work at a
 
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.030 align:start position:0%
but if you are going to work at a
company

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
and they ask for
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
no other documentation of any other
 
00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.109 align:start position:0%
no other documentation of any other
vaccines

00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
should they be allowed to force their
 
00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:02.390 align:start position:0%
should they be allowed to force their
employees

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
to take this one
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
i think that is something that has to be
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
again up to the employer that's based on
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility i mean there is um the
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative connect said that there's
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
changing um policies and situations so i
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i really would leave that up to the
 
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.790 align:start position:0%
i i really would leave that up to the
employer

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%

my story is part of my testimony
 
00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.589 align:start position:0%
my story is part of my testimony
actually

00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
plan on addressing some of these topics
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
but after having listened to some of the
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
other testimony i've been i
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
add some things to my testimony
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
we just we just heard that uh
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
from previous testimonies that uh
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
because we we require these other
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
vaccines that we should you know it's
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
it should be a policy that we require
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
this covert 19 vaccine we shouldn't
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
question it because
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
of course we we require other vaccines
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't think those
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
testimonies take into account that
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
theirs the vaccine adverse event
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
reporting system now has registered
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
unprecedented amounts of side effects
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and damages to people including deaths
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
that never happened with any of the
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
other vaccines and to call this
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
experimental medication that they're
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
a vaccine i think is unfair as well
 
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.870 align:start position:0%
a vaccine i think is unfair as well
because

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
this is not a vaccine in by definition
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
until they change the definition
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
this is really an experimental
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
medication that's really gone awry
 
00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:09.349 align:start position:0%
medication that's really gone awry
um

00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
we talk of i'd also like to talk about
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of this vaccine we're
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
finding out now that people who have
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
taken this vaccine have
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
a it's creating a negative
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
efficacy and i'd like to explain what
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
that means if you had the vaccine it's
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
damaged in the immune system
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
now people are more likely to contract
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
variants of this cova-19
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
virus or i shouldn't say cova-19 that is
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
a variant we should call it a sars covid
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
ii virus the new variants now we're more
 
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.510 align:start position:0%
ii virus the new variants now we're more
likely

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
likely
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
catch this virus if you've had the
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine so we're seeing negative
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
efficacy not positive efficacy in other
 
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
words we're not seeing a benefit to
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
these so i'd like to set the record
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
straight on that based upon the current
 
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.670 align:start position:0%
straight on that based upon the current
science

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
science
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
um we talked there was also talk about
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
natural immunity versus vaccine immunity
 
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.589 align:start position:0%
natural immunity versus vaccine immunity
and

00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
we are seeing now myself i
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
i had the coke the saurus covertube
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
virus with and most likely the delta
 
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.710 align:start position:0%
virus with and most likely the delta
variant

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
variant
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and when i had my blood work taken not
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
only does my t cell t detect cell come
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
up positive which means i have
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
long-lasting immunity
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
not just the uh a short-term immunity
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
from the vaccine now we know because
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
boosters right there it isn't a
 
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
boosters right there it isn't a
long-term

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
immunity it's a short-term immunity or
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
else we wouldn't require these boosters
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
but the natural immunity is far superior
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
as the evidence is beginning to
 
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.069 align:start position:0%
as the evidence is beginning to
demonstrate

00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
cloth masks
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
cdc has just changed their uh opinion
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
and you can and i think just this week
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see in all the major news
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
networks it's not just uh
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
a conspiracy theory conspiracy theories
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
are only conspiracy theories until
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
they're proven true and then they're
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
just a conspiracy but
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:00.710 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
cloth masks don't work
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
they just don't work this is a disease
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's spread by aerosols not by large
 
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.670 align:start position:0%
that's spread by aerosols not by large
droplets

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
droplets
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then we may have an argument that
 
00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.230 align:start position:0%
and then we may have an argument that
maybe

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
as physicians we should all be wearing
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
n95 mass and
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that any i i would say
 
00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
very few people in this room even know
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
n95 means the n stands for non-oil if it
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
gets wet it's an ineffective mask
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
if it's not fit properly it's
 
00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
ineffective 95 means that it was
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
the mass are tested
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
for particles that are 0.3 microns or
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
larger it can stop 95 percent of those
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
but still the holes in that in that mask
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
are large enough to let
 
00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:48.150 align:start position:0%
are large enough to let
things

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
smaller than 0.3 microns through
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
like this virus the sars co2 virus which
 
00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
is 0.1 microns
 
00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.470 align:start position:0%
is 0.1 microns
so

00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
so
it's

00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is an ineffective
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
way to stop a pandemic to put on these
 
00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.270 align:start position:0%
way to stop a pandemic to put on these
masks

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
masks
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
not my by my opinion but based upon the
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
science and then telling people to put
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
on a cloth mask when we know that an n95
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
and we've had this virus now for two
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
years over two years don't you think
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
that the scientists who just who did the
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
experiments to to show that an n95 mass
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
could stop point three
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
things that are 0.3 microns or larger 95
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
don't you think in two years we could
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
have done a study to show
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
what effectiveness what percentage not
 
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.589 align:start position:0%
what effectiveness what percentage not
95

00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
95
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
a 0.1 micron
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
virus would be for that mask
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
it will be something less than 95 but
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps it's a it's an n30 mask when it
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
comes to a virus this this particular
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
virus only 30 percent effective
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
and then if we put it tell people to put
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
a mask on a cloth mask or even these n95
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
masks which we know now are not 95
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
percent effective because the the
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
particle the viruses
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
is 0.1 microns aren't we putting people
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
in harm's way thinking that they're
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
protecting themselves
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
when actually they're putting themselves
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
in harm's way the the the part of the
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
population that's most at risk
 
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're telling them
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
sew a mask together made out of your
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
underwear put it over your face a piece
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
of cloth
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
and you're going to protect yourself
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
from virus no what we just did was we
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
put them in harm's way
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
this wasn't initially part of my
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
testimony but i thought i should address
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
those topics i'd like to now
 
00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.630 align:start position:0%
those topics i'd like to now
address

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
parts 1 and part 4 of this bill which is
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
requiring the mass and discrimination i
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
sit here before you today because i had
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
to flee the state of rhode island
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
because if i continued to practice
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
even though i had natural immunity and i
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
was able to prove it in my serology in
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
my blood tests and my my antibodies were
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
four times higher
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
typically than those people who had who
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
even though i could do that
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
and i went to seminary school at trinity
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
college of the bible before i went to
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
chiropractic school and every one of
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
these vaccines was either tested
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
its efficacy
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
or developed
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
using aborted fetal cells murdered
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
children's cells
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't put that sin into my arm
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
but the state of rhode island didn't
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
allow for a religious
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
objection so
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
i had to leave a half a million dollar
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
practice with 11 500 patients that i
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
it was worthless when i went to go sell
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
it the practice the people that evaluate
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
practices told me it was worthless just
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
sell your building and leave and that's
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what we did we sold the building
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
we sold our home and here we are
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to see that happen in

right
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
so requiring mass and discrimination on
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
the basis of kova 19
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
is the reason why i sit here before you
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
trying to keep this to live free and die

state

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
to keep liberty in a place
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
of democracy in a democratic republic
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to now address
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
so if you want to see what what you know
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
if physicians will leave with health
 
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
care providers what they can how they're
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
going to respond when they're forced
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it before you go on to
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
that point you'd ask me five minutes and
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to you you've gone past that
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you now to summarize
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
because we've got a number of people who
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
wish to speak
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
immunity passports and and requiring uh
 
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.430 align:start position:0%
immunity passports and and requiring uh
documentation

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
80 years ago in germany we were asked
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
i would it would be an absolute shame
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
to walk into a place of business
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
and be asked to be shown your papers
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
particularly because my the heritage of
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
my family
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
goes back to to germany and russia
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i will not allow
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
people walking into a place of business
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
so much to summarize
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
this bill on all four parts protects the
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
freedom of new hampshire the people of
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it protects their health
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
and it protects the livelihood of the
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
people who live here

my name is pam dinapoli and i am the
 
00:53:12.559 --> 00:53:13.430 align:start position:0%
my name is pam dinapoli and i am the
current

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
executive director of the new hampshire
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
nurses association and i'm a nurse
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
um i submitted my uh written testimony
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
digitally and so i'll just summarize a
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
few things
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard the narrative over the last
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
couple weeks about vaccines and mass and
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
mandates and opposing and support so i'm
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
just gonna talk about two key points
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
um we still have a pandemic the pandemic
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
is still raging um you're hearing about
 
00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:43.589 align:start position:0%
is still raging um you're hearing about
fewer

00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
fewer
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
cases being hospitalized but that
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're being
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
discharged from hospitalization
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
so the the beds are still at capacity so
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about that
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
and further restricting the use of
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
proven interventions such as
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinations masking and social
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
distancing including staying home when
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
you're sick to decrease the spread of
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
covet will prolong the pandemic and
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
result in a continuing strain on health
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
care resources both human resources and
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
capacity resources
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
and it will continue the spread of
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
the osha general duty standard says it
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
requires employers to provide a work
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
environment that is free from recognized
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
cause death or serious physical harm
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting employers in places of
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
public accommodation from adopting
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
mandates that would otherwise protect
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
employees from transmission of covert 19
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
has the potential to cause death and
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
serious physical harm to vulnerable
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
including those unvaccinated
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
we all want employees and those that
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
they serve to be treated fairly that
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%

further protections that pro that

private employers can implement has the

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
would you um agree that there should be
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
standard for
 
00:56:25.599 --> 00:56:26.950 align:start position:0%
standard for
medical

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and with private employers
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
for instance say truck drivers who are
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
in the vehicle themselves all day long
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
who are now being barred from going into
 
00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:39.190 align:start position:0%
who are now being barred from going into
canada

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
canada
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
or or
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
other workplaces where
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
there may be some exposure but nothing
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
like a health care facility where
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh people are are in close contact all
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
day with people who have cope and so
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
forth would you agree that there there
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
should be a a separate standard for
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
those two bodies
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
well i think it all depends on your work
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
environment and where you work so if i'm
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
a truck driver and i'm in my cab and i
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
get out and i pump gas
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
and i go in and i pay for the gas and
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
that person in the in the store that
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a mask is not vaccinated
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
comes into contact and then it trickles
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
down so that's that's the way viruses
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
work is that the more exposure the more
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
the virus expands so i think everyone
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be protected the level of
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
protection so if i'm a healthcare worker
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
i want full ppe
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
when i'm taking care of a patient if i'm
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
a truck driver i may just want to wear a
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
mask when i go into the store so in
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
terms of a standard
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
it definitely is leveled but everyone
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
should be protected
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:50.390 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
question

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
it seems that you're very knowledgeable
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
about this so i'm hoping i can ask you a
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
more detailed question
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you know of any studies that show
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the mass protest protects anybody
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
other than the wearer outside of a
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
i couldn't quote you a study but i've
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
read studies yes
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you could forward those to me i've
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated them before i'd appreciate
 
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.309 align:start position:0%
evaluated them before i'd appreciate
that

00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:14.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
and follow up
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
and follow up would be
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware that even with the vaccine
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
people are able to transmit covet so
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
that it does not stop it in its tracks
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
and the main benefit is to reduce
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations which is another
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
personal benefit right
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you for being
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
here today and isn't the reduction of
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations a benefit not only to
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
are not hospitalized with covet but also
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
a benefit to everybody who has a car
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
accident a heart attack a stroke
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
cancer surgery
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
that currently needs hospital of space
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
but is not able to get it that's exactly
 
00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.710 align:start position:0%
but is not able to get it that's exactly
right

00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
or the person who has pain in their
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
elbow and is putting off getting their
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
elbow surgery so that they're not able
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
to exercise i mean the capacity issue is
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
more than just not enough beds for
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
covered patients it's not enough beds
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
for people to protect their own health
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
or get the treatment that they need
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative delemus
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.030 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
as we heard from the doctor prior
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
considering the evidence i mean
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
well first of all do you believe
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
that new information
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
as we continue to examine this disease
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
should be considered when establishing
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
mandates and usurping people's freedoms
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
well i think that answers your own
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
question as we continue to get evidence
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
everything's going to evolve so we need
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
to start at the place of the most
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
protection and as the evidence becomes
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
more clear then we change is like what
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
we have seen with this virus so far so i
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
think that we all have to continue to be
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable and read the evidence and
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
stay protected especially those who are
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable or being taken care of
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
because of their vulnerabilities follow
 
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
up thank you
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
um and considering the evidence i
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe it or not i used to sell filters
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
so the some of the filtration
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
systems that i dealt with actually
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
were very effective because they used a
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
static electricity to capture particles
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the microns that the doctor was
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
very important and if
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
if he is correct and i believe he is
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
that the size of the of the virus itself
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
is a 0.1 micron which is actually rather
 
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
is a 0.1 micron which is actually rather
large

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
large
um

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
well would you believe
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
that well considering the evidence
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
how how effective do you really believe
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
the masks are
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
if they're allowing particles to get
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
through if they're only filtering to
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
you know like a 0.3 and the microns 0.1
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're getting you're able to pass
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
aerosol through the masks in and out and
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
aren't the masks uh
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
originally designed
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
to protect the wearer and
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
not the person who the wearer is
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
speaking to
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
well personally i'll continue to wear a
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
mask until i have evidence that i don't
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
given the
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
change in protocols that we
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
first recently heard from sweden and
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
then denmark and then the united kingdom
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
a couple days ago
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
do you believe that evidence is coming
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
i think so i mean i think the scientists
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe there's at least two
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
variables as to
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
why one is science is ever evolving
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
as new information happens and secondly
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
it seems that the pandemic is evolving
 
01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.789 align:start position:0%
it seems that the pandemic is evolving
from

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
the original one to delta to omicron to
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
i guess son of omicron
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
there are more greek letters but
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
apparently this is just a variant of the
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
variant so
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
given would you do you know that given
 
01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:47.029 align:start position:0%
given would you do you know that given
this

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
evolution of both scientific knowledge
 
01:02:49.839 --> 01:02:50.950 align:start position:0%
evolution of both scientific knowledge
and

01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.750 align:start position:0%
and
events

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be surprised that
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
we will be given different
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
suggestions regarding masks
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
don't ask me to repeat that
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
i i think that that
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
if we've learned anything from this
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
disease is that it's evolving and that
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
we have to continue to look at the
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
evidence and i guess continue to try to
 
01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.589 align:start position:0%
evidence and i guess continue to try to
prevent

01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
preventable illness and death
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative gay one question
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative i'll choose
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative gay one question
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
um are you have you studied the clinical
 
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.630 align:start position:0%
um are you have you studied the clinical
trials

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
trials
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
of hydroxychloroquine
 
01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:38.870 align:start position:0%
of hydroxychloroquine
ivermectin

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
ivermectin
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
and in particular the study in
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
argentina of 800 health care workers who
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
were divided into
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
a placebo group and the group that got
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
ivermectin but it was double-blind so
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't know what they got
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the 400 of the 200
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
people who got the placebo
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
got sick 58 of them got sick and of the
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
600 who got the ivermectin
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
none of them got sick
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
it was prophylactic
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh i've read a lot of the armor mectin
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
studies yes and i know a lot of them
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
have been discredited so what we want to
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
look at is the meta-analyses which looks
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
at all of the data together because 800
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
is a small studies we put all the data
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
together into what they call a
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
meta-analyses and 15 percent of the data
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the largest meta-analysis study was
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
discredited so again i'm remembering
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
like masks is something that we're going
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
to continue to look at
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
but not use okay we strike we're
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
straying from the uh bill here
 
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.789 align:start position:0%
straying from the uh bill here
um

01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
please keep your questions on the bill
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
iver mechton is not on the bill
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.670 align:start position:0%
uh representative
um

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.430 align:start position:0%
um
cofold

01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
so we're we're often called upon to um
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
to balance the rights of one group or
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
party against the rights of another
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
and um you know one example would be a
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people have a concern that
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be offended by
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
certain speech and we have to balance
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
that against the constitutional right to
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
free speech
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is you know
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
do you acknowledge that there are
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
two competing sets of rights here one is
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
the right to medical self-determination
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
and then the other is
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
i would not call it a right but your
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
perceived right or what i think is is a
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
right that you're perceiving
 
01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:45.750 align:start position:0%
right that you're perceiving
to

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:47.190 --> 01:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
to live in
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
a germ-free environment or as safe safe
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
as possible environment
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh as i understand this bill it
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
prohibits mandates so
 
01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.069 align:start position:0%
prohibits mandates so
that

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
means that i don't have the right to
 
01:06:00.319 --> 01:06:01.430 align:start position:0%
means that i don't have the right to
then

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
mandate something for the protection of
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
my own
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
employees so i think yes everything is
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
balancing but the idea to prohibit
 
01:06:09.119 --> 01:06:10.630 align:start position:0%
balancing but the idea to prohibit
mandates

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the flexibility that we
 
01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the flexibility that we
need

01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you

uh i do a lot of study on this
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and with regards to this mandate even
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
this word mandate
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
i don't find it in the state
 
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
i don't find it in the state

telling everybody
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
that they're here their herd immunity
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
or their own immunity is no good
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
and teaching

that their immunity means nothing
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
unless we want to keep on jabbing you
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
with a
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
needle the choice of the people has been
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
taken away
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
i've got a very close relative or had a
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
very close relative
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
he was a school teacher in massachusetts
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
he ran in the marathons never a smoker a
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
drink or a party it worked out every day
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
believed in this covert thing and went
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
and got the vaccine
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little too much to take
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
i know many people that have lost their
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
jobs over this
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
you've got to choose whether you're
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
going to put a needle in your arm
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%

until just
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's been no study of a year two
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
years three years five years or ten
 
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
years three years five years or ten
years

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
and we're ready to mandate people and
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
tell them show me your papers
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
and then we really need to look at
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
what's in the vaccines
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
has anybody here ever heard of graphene
 
01:09:15.839 --> 01:09:18.950 align:start position:0%
has anybody here ever heard of graphene
oxide

01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
besides

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
besides
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
baby fetal parts being in these vaccines
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
which has been proven
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
graphene oxide is in every one of these
 
01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.789 align:start position:0%
graphene oxide is in every one of these
vaccines

01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
graphene oxide gets in your system
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
and it creates like its own little
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
wiring system
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
and 5g can be used to control it
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
study it
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the cdc
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
has been proven time after time
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
to be full of lies
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
and you know early care
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
i got the cobra real bad the beginning
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
of last year
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
and i had ivermectin in my cabinet
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
i couldn't breathe the second day i was
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
ready to go to the hospital
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
what's going on well if you've got that
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want you bringing it here
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
that was that was cmc in manchester new
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire i won't say the doctor's name
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
early care worked for me i had
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
ivermectin at home
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
so let's go over these uh the things in
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit state or local government
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
agencies from requiring masks
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't need any
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
government telling me whether i should
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
wear a mask or not i said that before
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you want to put a
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
fence up in your yard
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
to cause mosquitoes from not crossing
 
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
your fence it's the same thing
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
as wearing these masks
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
you can't put a fence up with holes that
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
big in it and expect me mosquitoes not
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
to get through it's the same thing
 
01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
secondly people that are getting these
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
shots are the ones that are losing their
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
hurt immunity and they're shedding to
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
other people
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
and giving other people the virus
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's a proven fact now
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
but back to back to this law prohibits
 
01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
but back to back to this law prohibits
um

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
state and government agencies from
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
issuing immunity passports or
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
standardized documentation
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
this government we have especially the
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
federal one cares not about the states
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
we have 50 states
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
and there would be no federal government
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have those 50 states
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
so they're turning around now and it's
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
just like when they do the uh
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
when they come to your house and do the
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
census mr rossetti uh we've got a lot of
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
people testifying i'm almost done i
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you sir okay
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh when they do the census they collect
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of information
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
for a long time people in
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
state governments have been against the
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
government collecting that information
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
when they when they document you on this
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
they put you into a bank and they have
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
all your medical information as far as i
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
know socialists love having the medical
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
system in their hands
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
somebody said it before me show your
 
01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
somebody said it before me show your
papers

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not showing papers to anybody
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
whether i have a vaccine or not is
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
nobody else's business hipaa law covers
 
01:12:27.679 --> 01:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
nobody else's business hipaa law covers
that

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i don't think any state
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
anywhere should be mandating that people
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
have to have a vaccine or lose their job
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
or can come into this public place or
 
01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:40.630 align:start position:0%
or can come into this public place or
restaurant

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
that is totally against the freedom that
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
america was built upon
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
if anybody's got questions i'll gladly
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
take them
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
i know i'm a little scary looking but i
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
won't harm anybody
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
the only thing the only thing that's
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.830 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions have a question i i
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
what about the idea that
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm a carrier
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
other people get sick because of me and
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
i have a responsibility to them unless i
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
choose to live way up north in the woods
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
and never have contact with anybody else
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
there was a question in there i forget
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it was but what do you think
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
well if you're sick you shouldn't be
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
going near other people
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
if we if we look at the r naught factor
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay the r naught factor is on
 
01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
every every you get the measles the
 
01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
mumps this that or the other they've all
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
got an are not factor
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
the r knot factor for covert is 2.4
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
for the measles
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's 18.
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
so when a kid has the needles measles we
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
don't shut down the street
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
we don't tell everybody you can't go
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
near joe's house because joe's sons got
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
the measles
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
in other words if you're sick
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
protect others put a mask on
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
but don't make me have to wear a mask
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
because you're a
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
a jerk
 
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.709 align:start position:0%
a jerk
so

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
that you know i'm just like i said i'm
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
just a straight guy from the street but
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
come on here we got to get serious this
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
comes down to common sense the proof is
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
turning around now when england turns
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
around and says
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
stop this with the covet and the backs
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
and all this stuff
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
and many other countries are doing this
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
when we look at india
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
and five percent of the populations got
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
covered you've answered you've answered
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
my question we gotta
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
answer my question
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
one question from representative canark
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um i was curious uh
 
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:55.430 align:start position:0%
thank you um i was curious uh
that

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
you made a comment about the
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
the constitution earlier and that there
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
are no mandates stated in the
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
constitution but are you familiar with
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that in part one article three
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
that it says when men enter into a state
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
of society they surrender up some of
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
their natural rights to that society in
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
order to ensure the protection of others
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
this is a bit of a follow-on to our
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
chairs question
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
so would you agree that there is
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
recognition in the new hampshire state
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
constitution that we do not have
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
complete liberty but we have to give up
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
some for the protection of others
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
well yeah this is this is why we have
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
resolutions instead of mandates
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is why we suggest to people to use
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
their common sense if you're sick we're
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
a mask don't go out in public don't be
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
kissing and hugging everybody if you're
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
not don't
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
so to mandate something is a government
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
putting down an edict
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
do we not mandate that you cannot drink
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
excessively and then go out and drive
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the protection of others
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
well there you go there's the common
 
01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
sense thing if i'm gonna go out and
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
drink excessively
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
and get in a vehicle and be blacked out
 
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and run as others over that's my fault
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's on me it's also against
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
well it is against the law i agree with
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
you 100
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
but does i don't see the word mandate
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr rossetti
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much excuse me there was
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
a hand up before i said that so
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
and discussing all of these i know that
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
our constitution does talk about those
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
trade-offs but do you
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that even if you're vaccinated
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
you can still spread covid do you think
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
that forcing someone to be vaccinated to
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
protect others when those who are
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated can be carriers would fall
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
under that requirement
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody should be forced
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
at all i think that should be suggested
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
to them i think that's up to the the uh
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
patient doctor relationship
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
and and if and i'm not going to go into
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
it but doctors have been bought off
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
and all you have to do is study it to
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
find out they make a certain amount of
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
money for a covered case certain amount
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
of money for where it is a certain
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money for us whereas that's
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
what okay
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
sorry you answered my question i really
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%

hb 1224 as written does not clearly

define places of public accommodation
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if hb 1224 would apply to

nursing homes hospitals or any other
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%

not at this time have any intention of

implementing schools or child care

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
while the department does not have at
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
this time any intention of implementing

school or child care requirements for
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
covet 19 vaccination the department is
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
concerned that hb 1224 would circumvent
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
the department's authority under 141 c
 
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:55.280 align:start position:0%

requirements
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
there is too much uncertainty about
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
covet 19 to place a prohibition that
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
would threaten the ability to make
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
future public health decisions
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%

contrary to 141.c which obligates the

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
entered into the nhiis
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
records can be attained through written
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
request or downloaded through the secure
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
patient portal this bill would prevent
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
patients from accessing replacement
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%

versions of their information
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the department is also opposed to hb
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
1224 as the language as written is
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with 141-c
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
paragraphs two and three which state the
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions where proof of code
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
vaccination may be required
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
hi janice emery extern with dhhs um we
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to add that the department's
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
goal here is really to balance public
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
health with individual choice and we're
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you've done
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%

wow
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i i have a question for
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
whomever wishes to try to answer it
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i i think i've got this right
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
that this bill would
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
do something negative
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the department's
 
01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:21.189 align:start position:0%
to the department's
authority

01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
is it not the case you have the
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
authority we choose to give you
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
that you work for us you are the
 
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
that you work for us you are the
executive

01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
folks to do
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
what the legislature
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
either instructs you to do or not do
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
what we prohibit you to do and your
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
authority is derivative is that not
 
01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.229 align:start position:0%
authority is derivative is that not
correct

01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question chairman
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
pearson um that is correct um one for
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
rsa 141c was put into statute to protect
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
public health and protect against
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
communicable disease so as
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
according to the statute that's our task
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
and if the legislature chooses to make
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
amendments to 141c we would have to
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
abide by that that's correct
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
i think that's a kind of a scary truth
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to nail it down yes
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
as the token attorney on the committee i
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
welcome you
 
01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.229 align:start position:0%
welcome you
um

01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
would enacting this statute
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
repeal your authority to provide me with
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
a replacement card for the volunt for
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccine that i accepted voluntarily
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
at a state vaccine site
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
when i lose the card
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
and it would prohibit
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
my ability
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
at my choice
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
to share my decisions appropriately with
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
whomever i chose to share it with
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
if i happen to lose the little piece of
 
01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:09.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:12.229 align:start position:0%

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your question
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
we are concerned that this bill would
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
potentially impact that ability to issue
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
the cards
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
as this bill does
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
state that prohibits state or local
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
government agencies from issuing
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you let me follow up on that
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
question if that means i choose
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
to travel
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
to another state
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
where they have chosen and i'm not in
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
their legislature they have chosen to
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
require me to present a card
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm over a barrel now and i'm even
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
frantically now searching to see if i
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
still have my card
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
would that not put me at a disadvantage
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
and take away my choice to travel
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
if a state uh yes thank you for the
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
question if a state required
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination to enter the state
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you did not have a car that you
 
01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.629 align:start position:0%
and you did not have a car that you
would

01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
be over a barrel
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
yep i did find my card but thank you for
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you very
 
01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you very
much

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:20.790 align:start position:0%
much
um

01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
would a couple of word changes in that
 
01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph number roman numeral one where
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
it says they don't issue
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
the passport
 
01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.189 align:start position:0%
the passport
uh

01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm guessing and please tell me what
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
you think i'm guessing that the attempt
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
in this paragraph is to say
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
that you don't issue passports but it
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't prohibit you issuing proof
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
because the real issue here i think and
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
you please tell me what you think is
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
ban passports that would be a
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
requirement to go somewhere that's to me
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
is a different issue there's two issues
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
here i think thank you for the question
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative gay i would um i would
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
point you to page two paragraph two
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
where there's a definition of um in the
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislation of immunity passport well it
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
does say uh means vaccine passport
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine pass or any standard
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
documentation standard documentation
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%

01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
cdc card that the state distributes uh
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
there was an exception that was added i
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
believe during the committee of
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
conference and
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as we passed it out of this
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so i'm just hoping to
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
remove that and
 
01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.229 align:start position:0%
remove that and

i don't believe that private employers
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%

workforce shortage
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
and you may have heard a lobbyist from
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
the association of counties tell us that
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
they only lost 10 nurses in the county
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
and i have heard from
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
far more than 10 that had a very
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
difficult time either securing an
 
01:43:37.679 --> 01:43:38.790 align:start position:0%
difficult time either securing an
exemption

01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
or just
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
chose not to fight and just left
 
01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
chose not to fight and just left
so

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:45.510 --> 01:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
i i will say that i see the county
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
nursing home shifts
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
being an agency nurse and they are
 
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:52.580 align:start position:0%
constantly running short and
 
01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:53.669 align:start position:0%

01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
they had a shortage before and
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
increasing that shortage even by 10
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
nurses has a significant impact
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere is hurting for staff but
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
especially our county nursing homes um
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
they don't pay as well to begin with um
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know 10 nurses is a lot you know one
 
01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
unit is typically run by one or two
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
nurses and you do the math
 
01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
nurses and you do the math
um

01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know and the my understanding though
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
um is that you know we have exemptions
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
but the process
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
has become very cumbersome and to speak
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh to representative folsom's question
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
um there are questions for religious
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
exemption such as
 
01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.669 align:start position:0%
exemption such as
uh

01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
have you received any vaccines before
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
what makes this vaccine different
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
can you describe
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
how your religious beliefs impact
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
other aspects of your life
 
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.750 align:start position:0%
other aspects of your life
um

01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.189 align:start position:0%
um
sometimes

01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're almost set up the questions to
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
be like a trap
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.350 align:start position:0%
you know
guess

01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
just to make it very difficult for you
 
01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.229 align:start position:0%
just to make it very difficult for you
to

01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
prove your sincerity in your belief
 
01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:10.470 align:start position:0%
prove your sincerity in your belief
um

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day though who
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
suffers the most from losing staff
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's the patients
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
and the remaining staff when you're
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
running short staffed you have
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know a significant increase in
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
workload we already have you know high
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
workload as nurses and lnas and
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
mnas and um
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
just that the state needs to not condone
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of treatment of people
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
we should be setting the standard it's
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
unethical to deny skilled competent
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
medical professionals employment and to
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
deny patients and residents the staff
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
needed to care for them
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
based on their vaccination status we
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
have ppe
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to mitigate
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
this and now as the is
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
evolving as mr chairman said at the last
 
01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:03.669 align:start position:0%
evolving as mr chairman said at the last
meeting

01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh last hearing
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know we understand that it's not 100
 
01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:09.510 align:start position:0%
you know we understand that it's not 100
protective

01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
protective
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it's actually only about 43 percent
 
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.070 align:start position:0%
and it's actually only about 43 percent
protective

01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
protective
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
and those who get vaccinated can still
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
have the virus and there are
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in new hampshire that are
 
01:46:20.639 --> 01:46:21.669 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in new hampshire that are
permitting

01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
01:46:21.679 --> 01:46:23.109 align:start position:0%
permitting
positively

01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
positively
 
01:46:23.119 --> 01:46:25.109 align:start position:0%
positively
tested

01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
tested
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
nurses and other staff to work
 
01:46:30.550 --> 01:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
but they're not permitting unvaccinated
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
staff to work
 
01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
staff to work
um

01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.189 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
it just comes down to in in health care
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
we have the right of bodily autonomy
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's the nurses job to ensure
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
self-determination for patients
 
01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.870 align:start position:0%
self-determination for patients
and

01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think that that self-determination
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be protected for everybody
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
including health care workers they don't
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
give that up just because they want to
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
help people and care for people they
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
still have
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know their body to worry about and
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
their health to consider and their
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
beliefs and their conscience and
 
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
there is moral distress when they're
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
faced with
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
these decisions and moral distress is
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
one of the leading reasons that
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers leave the field
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
the uk just changed their practices
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and they are removing mandates for
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
and maybe last year they felt that it
 
01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.030 align:start position:0%
and maybe last year they felt that it
was

01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
was
um

01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
you know prudent but now where it's
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
being shown that even if you get
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you can still get it and
 
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
transmit it and that omicron doesn't
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
really respond to the vaccines as well
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
as delta and alpha did
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
um you know they've they've changed
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
course in their decision making and
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
will be repealing requirements for
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
health care workers and they also noted
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
that part of that decision
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
had to do with staff shortages
 
01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
so i think new hampshire
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
should make the move to remove this
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
exemption from the medical freedom of
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
in immunizations act
 
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.270 align:start position:0%
in immunizations act
and

01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
and
allow

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
our state to hire nurses
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
and other health care workers to work in
 
01:48:19.590 --> 01:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
our facilities regardless of whether
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and unfortunately i
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
have to ask the same question to ask you
 
01:48:30.790 --> 01:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
on the last bill and that is
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
what do you perceive will be the
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
implications given the supreme court
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
decision that the cms ruling regarding
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the requirement for vaccination for
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
health care workers
 
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
is constitutional
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
and our county nursing homes are funded
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
primarily by medicare and medicaid
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
what do you perceive will be the problem
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
when we violate that bypassing this and
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
how will we
 
01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
how will we
plug

01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
plug
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
the loss of revenue whether you think
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to increase the taxes that
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
immensely in the state to pay for our
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
health care
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
so as i stated during the last hearing
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
and i i know that this is a new hearing
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
so um in speaking with the 10th
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment center and with legislators in
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
florida who passed legislation that also
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
contradicts what the
 
01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
cms rule is they have they foresee no
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
issues with the federal government
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
continuing to certify and
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
reimburse for medicare and medicaid
 
01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:31.270 align:start position:0%
reimburse for medicare and medicaid
services

01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
since that supreme court decision was
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
handed down less than three weeks ago
 
01:49:40.390 --> 01:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
would you not say that that's not been a
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to find out what's going
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah i suppose that you know there
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
could be a movement by the federal
 
01:49:49.599 --> 01:49:51.350 align:start position:0%
could be a movement by the federal
government

01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
against the state of florida
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
so far it doesn't seem like it's going
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
to be an issue and again the 10th
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
amendment center
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
took took the position that you know the
 
01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:02.709 align:start position:0%
took took the position that you know the
state

01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
has more legal authority
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
in a legislatively passed law
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
and more legal standing than a federal
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
rule and that the federal government
 
01:50:13.119 --> 01:50:14.390 align:start position:0%
rule and that the federal government
will

01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
work with us and will not
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know withhold
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
important funding for our hospitals and
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
other health care facilities
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
um and i hope you mr chairman that you
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
will indulge me a little bit as i
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would go completely against
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for not making me an exception
 
01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:52.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for not making me an exception
um

01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative are you familiar with the
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
i am not representative okay so the
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
glencliff home is
 
01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire
 
01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.550 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire
run

01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
nursing care facility for people with
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
severe mental illness it's an unusual
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
situation most states do not have those
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
but in new hampshire along with new
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the state of new hampshire
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
also runs the glen cliff home which is
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
up where representative folsom lives
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
in the white mountain in the
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
very western part of the white mountains
 
01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.709 align:start position:0%
very western part of the white mountains
um

01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
so my brother-in-law lived at the
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
glencliff home for maybe eight to ten
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.239 --> 01:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
 
he

01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
was severely mentally ill his whole
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
adult life
 
01:51:48.719 --> 01:51:49.589 align:start position:0%
adult life
um

01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
very smart guy very funny guy great
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
athlete when he was young
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
but he had this terrible illness
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
and it led to terrible consequences with
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
his physical health and so he ended up
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
he needed the care of a nursing a
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatric nursing home and he lived
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
there for 10 years where they gave him
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
just as one example of the people who
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
would not have been able to socially
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
distance or wear a mask consistently
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
because he was
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
paranoid and had all different kinds of
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
things going on in his head that um
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
even if he had wanted to do those things
 
01:52:39.030 --> 01:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think he could have done those
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
things so my point being is that he's an
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
example of the type of very very
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people both medically and
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatrically who live at the
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
glencliff home
 
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:51.390 align:start position:0%
the glencliff home is one of the
 
01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:52.550 align:start position:0%
the glencliff home is one of the
[Music]

01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:53.990 align:start position:0%

institutions

01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
that is included
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
in this aspect of the bill that you
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
would suggest repealing or
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
changing the um
 
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.510 align:start position:0%
changing the um
exception

01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:08.629 align:start position:0%
exception
um

01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
i know from
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
and from previous testimony that um
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
you don't think the vaccinations are
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
that effective or as effective as
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
some other people think they are but um
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
you did say that they were 43 percent
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
effective in terms of something so i
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
know that you agree that they are
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat effective for some things
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't you think
 
01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.470 align:start position:0%
don't you think
people

01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
who are severely psychiatrically
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
and medically impaired and can't really
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves
 
01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
take care of themselves
um

01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
deserve the the
 
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
highest level of protection from the
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
people who work with them that they
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
could possibly have
 
01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative and yes of course i do
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
believe that they should have
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
protection um
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
insofar as it doesn't violate the rights
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
of others
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently we have the ability to rapid
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
you know and the idea that
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
a vaccinated person is guaranteed to be
 
01:54:26.239 --> 01:54:27.750 align:start position:0%
a vaccinated person is guaranteed to be
protected

01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
protected
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
has been shown to be false i mean we
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
could have someone who
 
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
is vaccinated but
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
you know is morbidly obese and has other
 
01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
compounding health issues and they may
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
not have any protection if they have a
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
poor immune system to begin with a
 
01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.109 align:start position:0%
poor immune system to begin with a
healthy

01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
young unvaccinated person may be less
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
likely to be infected and
 
01:54:52.149 --> 01:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
contagious than than that vaccinated
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
person so
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
there are so many variabilities in
 
01:54:58.709 --> 01:54:58.719 align:start position:0%
how effective
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
a covid vaccine can be in an individual
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it justifies a
 
01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it justifies a
blanket

01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
blanket
 
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.950 align:start position:0%
blanket
requirement

01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
for healthcare professionals to be
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in these settings and again
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
we still
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
always have the federal
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
civil rights act of 1964
 
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.109 align:start position:0%
civil rights act of 1964
and

01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:23.030 --> 01:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know no facilities
 
01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:24.229 align:start position:0%
you know no facilities
um

01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know can guarantee a 100 vaccination
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
rate because we do have
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
but i think what the state of new
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire needs to do
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
and the reason that i want
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
to bring this bill forward is i think we
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
need to step forward and say
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
we believe in the rights of the people
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
to choose when it comes to this vaccine
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
and that includes our health care
 
01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.629 align:start position:0%
and that includes our health care
professionals

01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh this
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
is you may have the answer to this i'm
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
hoping you do um
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned rapid tests and that the
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated come in and they could have
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
a rapid test done every time they came
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
knowing the number of breakout
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
infections among people who have been
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated do you know is it standard
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
practice to also do a rapid test every
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
day on
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
people who are vaccinated
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
it depends on the facility so different
 
01:56:33.589 --> 01:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
facilities have
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
have taken different approaches to that
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
some require three times a week for
 
01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.790 align:start position:0%
some require three times a week for
everybody

01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
some require
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
daily just for unvaccinated some don't
 
01:56:45.669 --> 01:56:45.679 align:start position:0%
require testing at all
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
so it depends on the facility and and uh
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
there have been different approaches
 
01:56:50.719 --> 01:56:51.589 align:start position:0%
there have been different approaches
taken

01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
taken
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
taking the question i know that the
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruling has been stated as
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
if it's all said and done but are you
 
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
aware that they just
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
granted a they stayed the preliminary
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
injunction pending the disposition of
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
the government's appeal in the eighth
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
circuit and depending on what happens in
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
the eighth circuit this will or will not
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
be upheld so some we don't know the
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
ultimate disposition of this case yet
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
i heard
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
some mumblings
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
that something was going on with it but
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
i did not hear the detail so thank you
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative woods thank you mr chair
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the chilling effect on
 
01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.629 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the chilling effect on
hiring

01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
01:57:40.639 --> 01:57:41.830 align:start position:0%
hiring
staff

01:57:41.830 --> 01:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
for nursing home
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
if the mandate is in place
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there are staff
 
01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:50.149 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there are staff
who

01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
will not work because
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
the other staff is not
 
01:57:59.189 --> 01:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in other words uh
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
i i know this uh personally
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
a nurse has decided to withdraw
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
from a nursing home
 
01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:07.990 align:start position:0%
from a nursing home
because

01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
of a if if there is no
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
mandate in place
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
she will feel unprotected
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore she has
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
family who have heart transplant and she
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
just can't take that kind of risk so
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
there's a chilling effect on the other
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
side too
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
that if there isn't sufficient
 
01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.270 align:start position:0%
that if there isn't sufficient
vaccination

01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
that there will be nurses leaving as
 
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
well do you have any idea how
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
big that component would be um thank you
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
for the question i don't know how big
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
that component would be
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
um but i do know that i have a list of a
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
thousand he'll over a thousand health
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
care workers who have reached out to me
 
01:58:47.119 --> 01:58:48.390 align:start position:0%
care workers who have reached out to me
um

01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
for help with dealing with mandates
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
because they have been forced to leave
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
their jobs and overwhelmingly that's
 
01:58:55.119 --> 01:58:56.070 align:start position:0%
their jobs and overwhelmingly that's
been

01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
the report from health care workers that
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
i've received
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
however um even if this didn't pass
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
again that employee can never be
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a 100
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinated work environment and that
 
01:59:12.310 --> 01:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
includes patients you know we can't
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
force patients to be vaccinated
 
01:59:16.159 --> 01:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
force patients to be vaccinated
and

01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
it calls into question um i guess
 
01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know i i would never
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
deny treatment to a patient based on
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
their vaccination status and i and i
 
01:59:31.030 --> 01:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
just hope that
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:43.189 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
setting aside the question of personal
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
rights which of course is important but
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're really concerned i'm
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that all of us are very
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about protecting patients
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we have far superior ways to
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
protect patients
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
such as the staff using prophylactic
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
treatments such as with hydroxychloric
 
02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:09.109 align:start position:0%
treatments such as with hydroxychloric
and

02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
and ivermectin which have been proven to
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
protect people from getting sick
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so there
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been any um you know clinical
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
trials comparing the efficacy of
 
02:00:23.830 --> 02:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination for prophylaxis versus
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or a
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
protocol of those so i can't say
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that one is more effective than the
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
other but i can say that there are
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
studies showing that ivermectin
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
and hydroxychloroquine as part of
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
preventive protocols are do have some
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
efficacy in preventing covid
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and also thank you
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
mr cushman's taking my question as i
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
look through the bill
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
and look at line three i may have missed
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
this new testimony
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
it says
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
medical freedom from immunizations are
 
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
we talking about all immunizations
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
things to do with
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
flu is a good example i mean there's
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
many immunizations beyond covet and i
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
think the broad
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
breadth of this language is concerning
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
because there's many times in which
 
02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and other capacities have
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
been shown to be very effective and also
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
very important to the safety of the
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
patients in which the facility is
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
treating i think
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
i want to give clarification on what you
 
02:01:34.870 --> 02:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
mean by immunizations
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question so the
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
statute that
 
02:01:38.239 --> 02:01:39.030 align:start position:0%
statute that
this

02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:40.070 align:start position:0%
this
um

02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is repealing language from
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
is specific to cova-19 vaccination
 
02:01:51.669 --> 02:01:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
would it be possible then to uh instead
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
of saying immunization be specific it
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
so it actually just repeals
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
so there's no language that's going to
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
be inserted it's repealing
 
02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.750 align:start position:0%
be inserted it's repealing
um

02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's section 2e
 
02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.669 align:start position:0%
it's section 2e
which

02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
basically says that
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
would you read it exactly yes
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
so paragraph 2e
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
says apply to county nursing homes the
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state hospital or any
 
02:02:26.790 --> 02:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
medical facility a provider operated by
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire any political
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision identified in paragraph one
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's saying that paragraph one shall not
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
apply to those and paragraph one says
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
every person has the natural essential
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
and inherent right to bodily integrity
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
free from any threat or compulsion by
 
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
government to accept an immunization
 
02:02:45.830 --> 02:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
accordingly no person may be compelled
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
to receive an immunization for cobit 19
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
in order to secure receive or access any
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
public facility any public benefit or
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%

or political subdivisions thereof
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative merchant thank you mr
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
chairman also representative cushman um
 
02:03:04.709 --> 02:03:04.719 align:start position:0%
i misread the mill so i stand corrected
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
on what i was trying to say so
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
i now understand it thank you thank you
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
for clarifying everyone
 
02:03:11.599 --> 02:03:12.830 align:start position:0%
for clarifying everyone
anyone

02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
and your microphone friend
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
why do i have to fight with these things
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry maybe this is all clarified in
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
141c but this bill only seems to
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
reference staff
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
not residents or patients in any
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
facility is that the intention of the
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill or is it
 
02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
is it is the intention of the bill to
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
only apply to staff because there's
 
02:03:47.109 --> 02:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
nothing in the bill that clarifies that
 
02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:47.990 align:start position:0%
nothing in the bill that clarifies that
so

02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specify and
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
as it's written now in statute it also
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify it but the bill i mean
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the statute that it's
 
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the statute that it's
in

02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
talks about public benefit or public
 
02:04:04.159 --> 02:04:05.430 align:start position:0%
talks about public benefit or public
service

02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
service
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
for um
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
that are offered from the state of new
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire so my assumption is that
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire's nursing
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
homes and
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
other medical facilities are not
 
02:04:25.109 --> 02:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
prohibited from requiring
 
02:04:25.119 --> 02:04:26.229 align:start position:0%
prohibited from requiring
patients

02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
to be vaccinated
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
while this language is there
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
and when we repeal it
 
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
they will not be able to deny a public
 
02:04:38.950 --> 02:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
service or benefit to patients or
 
02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:42.069 align:start position:0%
service or benefit to patients or
employees

02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.350 --> 02:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
of state
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
medical facilities so in your mind it
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
does apply
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes so in your mind it does apply to
 
02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:51.589 align:start position:0%
yes so in your mind it does apply to
both

02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
patients and staff
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
even though it isn't specified
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
correct and is there any useful reason
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
no i thought she said no i would like it
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
to apply to staff and patients that they
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
should have medical freedom in
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
immunizations thank you
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
 
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the
representative

02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you and the chair
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%

02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%

kate horrigan
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
we represent the new hampshire
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
association of counties
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm here today on behalf of the
 
02:05:57.189 --> 02:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
association in opposition to house bills
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
6 um
 
02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:00.629 align:start position:0%
6 um
1604.

02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
1604.
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
um as the sponsor bill indicated uh this
 
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
is a piece of legislation which would
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
make changes to um house bill
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
220 which passed just a few months ago
 
02:06:11.679 --> 02:06:12.870 align:start position:0%
220 which passed just a few months ago
um

02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
um
that

02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
that
bill

02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
created the exemptions for a number of
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
facilities including the county nursing
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
homes and it's primarily on behalf of
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
the the county nursing homes that we
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
were opposed to 1604
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
and hope to work with the committee to
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that the exemption
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
from state law as it applies to the
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
county nursing home stays in place
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
as you all know as members of your
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
county delegations the county there are
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
11 county nursing homes in new hampshire
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
they care for approximately 2 000
 
02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.149 align:start position:0%
they care for approximately 2 000
residents

02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
and employ approximately 4 000 staff at
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
the county nursing homes um among our
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
problems as articulated in the letter
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
that we sent you today is that the
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
challenge associated with conflicting
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
federal and state
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
regulations on the nursing homes um the
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
the committee is very well versed in the
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
provision the cms provisions for that
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
requires a rather rigid
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
infection control including vaccinations
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
at the at the nursing homes including
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes as a requirement
 
02:07:18.639 --> 02:07:19.990 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes as a requirement
for

02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement through
 
02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.709 align:start position:0%
reimbursement through
medicaid

02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:07:24.470 --> 02:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's the cms rule that we've talked
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
about our concern with eliminating the
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions exist today
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
is that would put us in conflict uh with
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
that which raises a whole number of
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
problems including which has been
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
identified here which is potentially
 
02:07:37.679 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
identified here which is potentially
putting

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
putting
 
02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:39.669 align:start position:0%
putting
um

02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
the medicaid match
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the county nursing homes at risk
 
02:07:47.030 --> 02:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
heard people suggest don't worry about
 
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:49.589 align:start position:0%
heard people suggest don't worry about
it

02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's some organization in the state
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
of florida that are saying it's probably
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be a problem but in fact we
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
think it probably will be a problem uh
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
both in its uh actual execution as well
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
as the financial steps that that that
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
the county governments would have to
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
take if those funds were at risk um you
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
know i
 
02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking a bit a minute about how
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to gather some other
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
information for the committee but i
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
think one of the risks to be concerned
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
about is whether or not there's a risk
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
of those funds being um not
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
presented to the county governments
 
02:08:23.750 --> 02:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether that would become an event on a
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
gas fee that would require
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of a notification of it being
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
a financial event which would put county
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
revenues at risk um that would happen
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
well before
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
any sort of a denial of the match from
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
the centers for medicare and medicare
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
 
02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:41.589 align:start position:0%
medicaid services
um

02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
so um as and i should also add that uh
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court decision a recent
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court decision uh uh
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 220
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
uh was enacted in such a fashion that it
 
02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
created the exemption for the nursing
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
home for the for the county-owned
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and so while a lot has
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
evolved between now and then
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work for the staffs at the
 
02:09:13.990 --> 02:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
nursing homes to comply
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
with the federal regulations and adding
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
another potential
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
interference with that with state
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
statutes becomes rather problematic for
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
i should also say you know we've
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
kate and i have a weekly conversation
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the county nursing home
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
we want to be as accurate as we possibly
 
02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
can with the committee with regard to
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
the impact on employment
 
02:09:45.109 --> 02:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
when we meet this week i'm going to try
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
to gather some additional information
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
but as the committee is probably well
 
02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.390 align:start position:0%
but as the committee is probably well
aware

02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
aware
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
the cms guidelines uh have a
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh phase one and a phase two component
 
02:09:57.270 --> 02:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
of it and they're also
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh it has it's a
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
relatively it's a relatively new
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
um provision so particularly after we
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
were waiting for the supreme court to
 
02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.229 align:start position:0%
were waiting for the supreme court to
act

02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
um a couple of counties couple of larger
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
counties actually went ahead and adopted
 
02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.430 align:start position:0%
counties actually went ahead and adopted
a

02:10:11.430 --> 02:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:12.709 align:start position:0%
a
um

02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
a more rigid vaccine i want to be
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
careful not to call it a mandate because
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
as we well know there are medical and
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
other exemptions under the guidelines
 
02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
but a number of at least two if not more
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
counties move forward with the exemption
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
the go live dates from the cms rule
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
but those go live dates uh would be
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
february fourth as we as we're
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
interpreting them would be february 14th
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh for the uh for the first
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine and then the second
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
dose would be on march 15th so it's
 
02:10:46.229 --> 02:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
still an evolving situation for the
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
counties but what we do want to do is be
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
able to report back to you after we meet
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
with folks this thursday more accurately
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
what some of the numbers are with regard
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
had their employment terminated as a
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
consequence with non-conformance with
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
and then one of the more challenging
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
things to do would be get our arms
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
around whether or not folks have moved
 
02:11:11.270 --> 02:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
on because of the mandate we'll do our
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
best on that
 
02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
but i think it was observed by someone
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
in this side of the room that
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
what we'll miss in that part of the
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
conversation we'll try to gather for you
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
is how is the
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine guidelines at a county nursing
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
home helped with employee retention and
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
that may well be because it has reduced
 
02:11:31.189 --> 02:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
the incidences of people calling out
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
being sick or people that want to work
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
in a safer environment
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's not as easy a number to gather
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
for you but i think it's part of the
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
consideration for the committee um we're
 
02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
going to try and do that
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
so um i mr chairman i trust you're
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
probably not going to act on this bill
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
before thursday
 
02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
before thursday
um

02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay thanks um but i'll tr uh kate and i
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
will try to get information through the
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee through you mr chairman with
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
regard to some accuracy on the numbers
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
but i think the numbers that kate
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
reported to you last week uh seem very
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
consistent uh with what we're hearing
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:12:08.069 --> 02:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes particularly
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that we have some live
 
02:12:11.430 --> 02:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
experience uh with two large nursing
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
homes that implemented
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
the guidelines back in november december
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
time period so
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
um so anyway with that i'm happy to
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
have i'll answer
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
one of yours we won't be executing
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
on thursday but we must by next tuesday
 
02:12:30.550 --> 02:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's an early bill thank you
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
question i just needed a clarification
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
because i was trying to
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
make sure i understood
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
which dates or which implementations
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
related to the two larger
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes in new hampshire and which
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
were the cmc guidelines am i right and
 
02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
thinking it's
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
february 14th and march 15th are the cmc
 
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines for implementation cms
 
02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:02.310 align:start position:0%
guidelines for implementation cms
guidelines

02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay so kate's
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
kate's my fact checker on that but she's
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
here yes okay and and
 
02:13:08.639 --> 02:13:10.470 align:start position:0%
here yes okay and and
so

02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes that you referenced
 
02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.109 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes that you referenced
actually

02:13:15.109 --> 02:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
implemented those guidelines earlier and
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
they've been in place for some time
 
02:13:22.390 --> 02:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
since since the end of last year is that
 
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
since since the end of last year is that
correct

02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.510 align:start position:0%
correct
um

02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
they implemented a
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
set of vaccine guidelines if they i'm
 
02:13:31.990 --> 02:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're exactly the same
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
as the cms guidelines but they are
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
has been represented to us essentially
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
and when did they implement those uh i
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
can check on you for that but i think it
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
was in the november time period okay
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative cofolt
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:13:57.350 --> 02:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned data collection and that
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to be looking at the
 
02:14:02.550 --> 02:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
benefits of
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
having everybody vaccinated in terms of
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
employee morale and employee retention
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
and the ability to hire new employees
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
will that data also include information
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
about employees that have
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
have been lost because
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
they don't want to get
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to be subject to a vaccine
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
mandate uh yeah that's as i said that's
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
the number we'll try to collect for you
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
as concise as we possibly can but if
 
02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:34.229 align:start position:0%
as concise as we possibly can but if
somebody

02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
moved on to other employment and their
 
02:14:38.550 --> 02:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
exit interview didn't include
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
information about vaccine their
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
hesitancy around the mandate uh we
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know that so well we'll do our
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
best to give you a sense of it um you
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.669 align:start position:0%
best to give you a sense of it um you
know

02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a scientific data collection
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's underway
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up um
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and and
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
do you have any data with respect to the
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
rates of covid infection
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
among staff including among staff who
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated versus non-vaccinated
 
02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:05.350 align:start position:0%
are vaccinated versus non-vaccinated
staff

02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
staff
 
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh we might
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
if i can gather that information i'll
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
do my best to get it to you and then i
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
think the other piece of it is they they
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
try to determine and i don't know how
 
02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
try to determine and i don't know how
well

02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
they can do determine if it was
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
community spread um or more likely from
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.079 --> 02:15:23.189 align:start position:0%
 
more

02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:15:23.199 --> 02:15:24.709 align:start position:0%
more
um

02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes in new hampshire
 
02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.149 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes in new hampshire
segregating

02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
segregating
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.109 align:start position:0%
employees and
patients

02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:15:35.270 --> 02:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
based on their vaccination status that
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
is having non-vaccinated employees
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
working only with patients
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
with certain populations of patients
 
02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
with certain populations of patients
and

02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
vaccinated employees working with other
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated patients are you aware of any
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
situation like that yeah we were there
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
were situations of that last fall
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
when there was some pretty aggressive
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in some of the more rural
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes where uh they they
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
did just that they created a reward and
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
made some accommodations around that but
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
that was prior to the availability of
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccines um so i don't know if that
 
02:16:11.910 --> 02:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
continues um but again i will try to get
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
an answer few in that
 
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
mice i suspect that those provisions
 
02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
mice i suspect that those provisions
that

02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:16.239 --> 02:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
that
because

02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the the staff are
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
complying with the guidelines that the
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
necessity of that um
 
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:25.109 align:start position:0%
necessity of that um
has

02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
they've moved beyond the necessity for
 
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
they've moved beyond the necessity for
that

02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leon thank you
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking the
 
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:34.549 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for taking the
question

02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
i i know that the healthcare worker
 
02:16:38.230 --> 02:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
shortage is not just in new hampshire
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and is around the country and i'm sure
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
you've heard that some states are
 
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
allowing vaccinated employees who test
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
positive to continue working through
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
without a quarantine period
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
i would like to know if any of our
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
county nursing homes are doing that
 
02:16:53.429 --> 02:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
policy or if they are considering that
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
policy because if they do i'd like to
 
02:16:56.399 --> 02:16:57.589 align:start position:0%
policy because if they do i'd like to
understand

02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:16:59.830 --> 02:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
where they stand on that versus
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated employees
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a long meeting on
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
thursday with the nursing administrators
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
but yeah i don't know the answer to that
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
i can try to get an answer for you but i
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
should say
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
part of the concern we have with
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
1604 is that by eliminating exemption it
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
creates a rather rigid um policy in that
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
we i think we all know we've heard from
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
all sides of the debate this is it
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
continues to be an evolving situation
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
there are periods where there needs to
 
02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
be more stringency and others with
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the future we might not need
 
02:17:31.519 --> 02:17:32.309 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the future we might not need
them

02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's different guidelines around
 
02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
isolation quarantine and things like
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
that and the problem with
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
this bill in that environment is it
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
takes that flexibility away from the
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
from the professional staffs there
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
if you've talked to your county nursing
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
homes and the administrators and the
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
directors of nursing you know they put a
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
lot of work into
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
infection control
 
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with standards that
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
cms sets that are
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
followed on by surveys that take place
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
at nursing homes and
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
not having the flexibility to operate
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
your facility in a way that complies
 
02:18:09.190 --> 02:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
with infection control and takes into
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
account the safety of staff and
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
residences is something that
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that flexibility and that ability
 
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
of your nursing administrators to keep
 
02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:18.629 align:start position:0%
of your nursing administrators to keep
their

02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
their environment their residents and
 
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
staff safe is a problem
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
with this type of state government
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
mandate on a local facility
 
02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.910 align:start position:0%
mandate on a local facility
follow-up

02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:18:32.629 --> 02:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like the reimbursement
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
guidelines from cms are actually having
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
more of an impact on day-to-day onto on
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
the practice of our county nursing homes
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
than our county commissioners are would
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:46.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:47.589 --> 02:18:47.599 align:start position:0%
or at least on these policies the
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine policies well with regard to
 
02:18:51.439 --> 02:18:53.750 align:start position:0%
vaccine policies well with regard to
the

02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
federal medicaid reimbursement of course
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's all dictated by the
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
social security act and cms rules and
 
02:19:03.030 --> 02:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
regulations that the you know
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that or fortunately
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
depending how okay the county
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
commissioners and u.s delegation members
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
um uh are not in a position to
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
um uh to formally make changes to
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
one more
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not sure if you're aware
 
02:19:21.190 --> 02:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
that they simply stayed the injunction
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
that supreme court hasn't rolled down
 
02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:24.150 align:start position:0%
that supreme court hasn't rolled down
finally

02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
if they end up overturning this rule and
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
that that cms had this authority will
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
people who have been vaccinated be able
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
to unvaccinate themselves once the
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
policy changes
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that's a county
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner decision or i'm trying to
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
be following the supreme court
 
02:19:42.950 --> 02:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with the procedures for
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
um unvaccination
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
you'd make a lot of money if you did
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
mr monahan i don't know if you know
 
02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.750 align:start position:0%
mr monahan i don't know if you know
that

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
my job as part of the county delegation
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
in rockingham county is overseeing the
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and further that i had a loved one in
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
there for quite some time so i'm very
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
close to the situation and
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
therefore my thought was
 
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
did our job well and interviewed well
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
and hired well
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
and the person is evidencing that
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
in this case he
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
is keeping up with an ever-changing
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
focus would i not be encouraged to let
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
our rockingham county
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrator under the
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
watchful eye of yours truly and a few
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
others get on with his job
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
with the flexibility he needs
 
02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.469 align:start position:0%
with the flexibility he needs
uh

02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that
 
02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that and i appreciate the
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
approach representative thank you sir uh
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
and following on to that question would
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
you also agree that
 
02:20:57.670 --> 02:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's very important to recognize that a
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
serving manchester and a nursing home
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
serving coast county may have very
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
differing needs at varying times
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
and that those needs may change
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
as we have seen them fluctuate
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
astronomically during the course of this
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
particular scourge
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes i believe that and that you know
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
would contribute to the reason why we're
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir and we will be
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
looking forward to hearing what happened
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
on thursday before next tuesday
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
joseph christie and ellen lapointe from
 
02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:51.670 align:start position:0%
joseph christie and ellen lapointe from
dhhs

02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
they have handouts or there is a handout
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman and members of the
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
committee my name is joe curisti i'm the
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
chief financial officer and legislative
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
liaison for new hampshire hospital and
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
glencliff home and with me today is
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
ellen lapointe the chief operating
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
officer for new hampshire hospital
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
we are here to testify in opposition
 
02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
today against house bill 1604
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'll just briefly touch on a few of the
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
key points of our concerns
 
02:22:33.670 --> 02:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
so the first of which
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
as we understand the first sentence of
 
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the medical freedoms act uh 220.
 
02:22:43.110 --> 02:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
it does not limit specifically to covet
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
19 and so we do believe that house bill
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
1604 would inhibit our ability to
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
require other forms of vaccination
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
as a condition of employment and that is
 
02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
a fairly long-standing practice in the
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
medical community for things like
 
02:22:57.200 --> 02:22:58.230 align:start position:0%
medical community for things like
rubella

02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
rubella
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
measles etc
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
and so that is that is one of our
 
02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:02.830 align:start position:0%
and so that is that is one of our
primary

02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
primary
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
concerns relative to
 
02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
the cms coven 19 vaccine mandate
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
as as it currently stands it is our uh
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
understanding and we've reviewed this
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office that
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
it is active
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
and so we are working towards adhering
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
to it
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
the enforcement mechanism that cms has
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
indicated for the kovid19 vaccine
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
mandate for hospitals is through the
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
accreditation process so these surveyors
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
and accreditors for hospitals and
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
nursing homes uh bear the primary
 
02:23:38.469 --> 02:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
responsibility for enforcement and what
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
that really does is
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
it it creates challenges for healthcare
 
02:23:45.030 --> 02:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
facilities if they were to not be in
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with the mandate
 
02:23:49.349 --> 02:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
there's a progressive disciplinary
 
02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
process from an accreditation
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
perspective that could put our
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
accreditation at risk
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a significant concern of
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
ours for a variety of reasons so
 
02:24:00.309 --> 02:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
without accreditation a lot of our
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
operations and clinical workflows
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
will be subject to a lot less regulation
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
there is also the concern that
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
very few facilities are unaccredited and
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of healthcare workers
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
who would likely not want to work in an
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
unaccredited facility so we do have some
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
concern relative to the potential
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
turnover if we were to be put into that
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
situation again that would be a
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
progressive process
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know cms has indicated they want to
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
work with organizations at every effort
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
to try to come into compliance with the
 
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
mandate but that is uh how we have uh
 
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
interpreted the guidance that we have
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
received up to this point
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
um and then our last uh i would say
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
significant point of concern is relative
 
02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:45.750 align:start position:0%
significant point of concern is relative
to

02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
the loss of uh cms related revenues
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
should we not be able to comply with the
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
cova 19 vaccine mandate so um we did
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
provide some fish fiscal information
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
relative to what that could
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
mean for new hampshire hospital and
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
in thinking about that particular
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
situation further
 
02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
since we provided that financial
 
02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
since we provided that financial
information

02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance revenues may also
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
be at risk for healthcare facilities as
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of them require accreditation as a
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
part of the contracting process
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
so that that also is a concern of ours
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:27.190 align:start position:0%
and we are
uh

02:25:27.190 --> 02:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
we anticipate that that risk could
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately result in something like new
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital and glencliff home
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
having to be 100 general funded
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
um so the relatively significant risk
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
there for uh for our organizations um
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the last point i also um
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
sort of wanted to thank representative
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
shapiro for his comments relative to uh
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
glencliff home and the populations that
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
our two organizations
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
serve it is a very challenging
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
population to work with from a infection
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
control perspective and we certainly
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
feel we have an increased obligation to
 
02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to protect those
 
02:26:04.319 --> 02:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
do everything we can to protect those
individuals

02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
especially the ones who are within our
 
02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:10.070 align:start position:0%
especially the ones who are within our
facilities

02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
on an involuntary basis so with that we
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any questions
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that you may have and thank you for the
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
merchant

02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
going back to my confusion before
 
02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
i think i'm more confused than i was
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
i thought i read the bill correctly i'm
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
not sure if i'm reading it but if i go
 
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
back and look at the actual medical
 
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
back and look at the actual medical
freedom

02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
immunization 141c one hey sort of
 
02:26:43.510 --> 02:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
brought this up
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
it says on the first line every person
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
has the natural essential
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
an inherent right to bodily integrity
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
freedom from any threat or compulsion by
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
government to accept any
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
aid back sorry immunization
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
so the way it's worded and it goes on
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
and talks about
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
covet is there confusion some confused
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
between that word immunization versus
 
02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
the next line it talks about covert
 
02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.389 align:start position:0%
the next line it talks about covert
specifically

02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
so in repealing this so we talk about
 
02:27:12.870 --> 02:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
the potential to repeal repeal all
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinations because of the way that's
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
worded in the statute therefore i may go
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
back to my original thing about being
 
02:27:21.270 --> 02:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
confused i'm now definitely confused
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question i think
 
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:23.910 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question i think
that

02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
is certainly the concern that we are
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
raising as an agency today is that first
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
sentence does not include any of the
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
words coving 19 or anything to that
 
02:27:33.270 --> 02:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
effect and therefore
 
02:27:35.750 --> 02:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
repealing our exemption from the medical
 
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
freedoms act
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
could potentially inhibit our ability to
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
require other forms of vaccination for
 
02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:43.270 align:start position:0%
require other forms of vaccination for
employment

02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you um
 
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the attorney general
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
has already ruled on the scope of this
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislation um the the law that's
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
already passed and that he has ruled
 
02:27:57.190 --> 02:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
that that's been ruled that it only
 
02:27:59.190 --> 02:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
applies to covet 19 and not to other
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
immunizations i was not aware of that
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask is if if perhaps the
 
02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
ambiguity in that statute is not a
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
lesson to us as
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
as a committee when we look at bills to
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that a statement of purpose
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
clause is labeled as a statement of
 
02:28:27.830 --> 02:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
purpose clause and then the actual
 
02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:29.190 align:start position:0%
purpose clause and then the actual
statute

02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:28:36.309 --> 02:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:39.270 --> 02:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
but we would certainly agree with some
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate your
 
02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes lori
 
02:28:55.840 --> 02:28:58.630 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes lori
orlano

02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.389 --> 02:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think i got it yesterday is it the
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay um i'm going to be brief because
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
it's lunchtime and i'm absolutely
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
certain everyone's hungry
 
02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:14.870 align:start position:0%
certain everyone's hungry
so

02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:15.910 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to set my stop watch my name
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
is lori ordolano i'm from nashua i don't
 
02:29:22.469 --> 02:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
have written testimony but i just wanted
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
to make a few comments on this i'm a
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
citizen i don't represent any medical
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
community or have a medical background
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
you know all of this type of legislation
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
is driven by these immunization issues
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
by the devastation of this
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
illness and the death toll that it has
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
taken and the burden it's placed on
 
02:29:43.270 --> 02:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals but i can't help but start to
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
question whether our treatment protocols
 
02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
were really appropriate in addressing
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
this and i think we have to
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
consider that when we look at this type
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
of legislation i mean this is an
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
inflammatory disease and treating
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
inflammation is something we've known
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
how to do for years and years and years
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm starting to wonder why we didn't
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
know how to do that for this one
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about data reporting
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think we have great
 
02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
data reporting going on and i think we
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
need to do a better job with our data
 
02:30:17.110 --> 02:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
reporting so we can make decisions on
 
02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
these impacts and one of the gentlemen
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
here who spoke about you know people
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
potentially in nursing homes that are
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
going to quit because they don't want to
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
be around people staff members who are
 
02:30:29.670 --> 02:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated very legitimate point but
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
we need to have a sense of
 
02:30:33.750 --> 02:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
how many people that encompasses versus
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
the ones who are just trying to maintain
 
02:30:39.270 --> 02:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
employment while having vaccine choice
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned that just because we
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
say the same thing over and over again
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it right you know
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
capitalism drives our our system and
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
those with the most money can also can
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
often dictate the message and from that
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
message we can have a false sense of
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
security and be misled so we have to
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
question more carefully what we're being
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
told and as a citizen you just have to
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
try and peel away at what you think is
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do i'm also very
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about in this only recently
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
happened for me the natural immunity
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
issue i was living in a bubble for a
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
while because i actually didn't realize
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
that people who had coveted and were
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
employed in jobs still had to go be
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinated i i didn't think that was
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
true when i first heard it i grew up or
 
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
when i had my children one of my doctors
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
had always said natural immunity is much
 
02:31:34.630 --> 02:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
better than um immunization because of
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
the way it goes through the nasal
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
passages the eyes and mouth that it was
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
better than a muscle injection i just
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
always thought that that was true
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
i was aware of it
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
natural immunity didn't count anymore
 
02:31:53.429 --> 02:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
and i've only for two months gone to our
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
board of health meetings in nashua i've
 
02:31:58.630 --> 02:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
attended four and i've asked our doctors
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
two two actual doctors a pediatrician
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
and a pulmonologist and a dentist sit on
 
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
that board and i ask them why we don't
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
consider it anymore and they won't
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
answer that question they just won't
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
respond so anytime
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
i ask a question
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
and i try to speak to them after the
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
meeting because you know public comment
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
isn't about questions it's only about
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
comment and that's fine because that's
 
02:32:24.550 --> 02:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
what rsa 91a allows you no problem but
 
02:32:26.469 --> 02:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
informal discussions after to connect
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
with them i i can't get answers to those
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions and if i can't get answers it
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
raises um concerns with me that we're
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
not looking at data appropriate
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately and you know life comes
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
with risks it just does there's no
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
guarantees and i am very concerned that
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
the younger population is being forced
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
into something that isn't suitable for
 
02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
the younger population because we don't
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
have enough data
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know i get it for the older
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
population i really do but
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
these costs and the money and the money
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get from the federal
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
government maybe we need to think about
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
the potential risks and costs associated
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
with forcing something that we don't
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of history on and the impact
 
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the cost of that to our state
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
um when we do these things i just i'm
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
just concerned so
 
02:33:15.429 --> 02:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
i've i've done my almost four minutes so
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
i'm stopping
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
wow thank you
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you so much have a good
 
02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:28.710 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you so much have a good
lunch

02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:33:30.309 --> 02:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
and then the final pink card from the
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.349 --> 02:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for test taking my testimony
 
02:33:45.190 --> 02:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
on this bill as well
 
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to preempt my statements by
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
saying i was notified during my um
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
testimony that my digital
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
testimony did not get to you and
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
some of my members said the same so
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
we'll be emailing it to you after this
 
02:33:58.720 --> 02:33:59.590 align:start position:0%
we'll be emailing it to you after this
meeting

02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
um the second was i just want to echo
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
the comments that our understanding was
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
that this applied to all of the
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
immunizations so in reading my comments
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about the term
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
immunization and again what was said is
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
hoping that that might be clarified
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
anyway in in 2021 the medical freedom
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
and immunization act became law
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
in signing the medical freedom bill
 
02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
governor sununu's press team announced
 
02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
as long as
 
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
as long as he has said governor sununu
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
believes that private entities have the
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
choice to require vaccination brandon
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
pratt the governor's deputy
 
02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
communications director told abc news in
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
a statement the simple fact remains that
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
the safest thing one can do is get
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated as soon as possible to help
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
increase the state's already high
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
by the nature of the business it was
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
logical then and now the county nursing
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
homes new hampshire hospital and state
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
operated medical facilities were exempt
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
from rules of the bill
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
being cared for by providers who have
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
not been fully immunized as defined in
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
cdc's annual guidelines which include
 
02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines such as hepatitis b
 
02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
influenza pneumococcal pneumonia measles
 
02:35:12.150 --> 02:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
mumps and rubella among other vaccine
 
02:35:14.870 --> 02:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases puts these most
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and sick residents at risk
 
02:35:18.389 --> 02:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
for a spread
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
historically health care institutions
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
have established requirements for
 
02:35:25.110 --> 02:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines as conditions of employment in
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
recent years there's been a move towards
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
increasing vaccine exemptions
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the coven 19 pandemic has
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
exacerbated conflicting beliefs
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
re-individual freedom and public health
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
and safety fueled by misinformation
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
about vaccines
 
02:35:45.910 --> 02:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
individual reasons for decisions not to
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
vaccinate include the safety of a
 
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination and or its ingredients
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
religious or philosophical objections
 
02:35:55.590 --> 02:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
fear of side effects and associated
 
02:35:58.630 --> 02:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
illness and lack of urgency or priority
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
explained in part by the supposition
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
that hurt immunity will protect the
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated from infection
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
if an unvaccinated person encounters
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
another person that is infected with the
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
virus they too will become infected
 
02:36:14.150 --> 02:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of human herd immunity
 
02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:15.910 align:start position:0%
regardless of human herd immunity
percentages

02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation proposed in hb 1604
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
conflicts with health care providers
 
02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
duty to protect self and others and may
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
interfere with the ability of
 
02:36:26.950 --> 02:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
institutions to establish requirements
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain health and safety effective
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
protection of the public's health
 
02:36:33.590 --> 02:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
mandates that all individuals receive
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
immunizations against vaccine
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases according to the
 
02:36:40.469 --> 02:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
best and most current evidence outlined
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
by the cdc
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
the acip and all health care personnel
 
02:36:47.270 --> 02:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
including registered nurses should be
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated according to these
 
02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:50.630 align:start position:0%
vaccinated according to these
recommendations

02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
02:36:53.990 --> 02:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
finally as has already been noticed the
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruling upholding vaccine
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
requirements in facilities that accept
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid payments
 
02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
could further jeopardize the health and
 
02:37:04.230 --> 02:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
safety of all those involved including
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
and among other residents health care
 
02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
providers pharmacists or housekeepers
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
the reduction or elimination of vaccine
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases is one of the
 
02:37:15.910 --> 02:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
greatest public health achievements in
 
02:37:17.510 --> 02:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
current evidence and research illustrate
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
that immunizations are essential to the
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
primary prevention of disease from
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
infancy through adulthood the new
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire nurses association urges the
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose h.b 1604
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you in advance thank you so much
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%

02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions for the committee
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
this ends the hearing on house bill 1604
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
and the question i need to ask is
 
02:38:00.479 --> 02:38:01.750 align:start position:0%
and the question i need to ask is
if

02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
there is anyone
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
who wishes to work on an amendment
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
we will be executing this bill one way
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
or the other on tuesday and it would be
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
helpful to me in my preparation to know
 
02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have to
 
02:38:20.319 --> 02:38:21.270 align:start position:0%
you don't have to
you're

02:38:21.270 --> 02:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
thinking of bringing forth an amendment
 
02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
thinking of bringing forth an amendment
perhaps

02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.910 --> 02:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
if one is required i'm one is
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's totally up to you folks
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:38.309 --> 02:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not volunteering for this but i also
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
have a question of the chair when you're
 
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
question to the chair i think also is to
 
02:38:51.270 --> 02:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
um clarify i think going to be
 
02:38:52.630 --> 02:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
clarification because the opening
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
statement really is not a statement it's
 
02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:54.830 align:start position:0%
statement really is not a statement it's
kind

02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
kind
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
of woven into the statute itself and i
 
02:38:57.920 --> 02:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
of woven into the statute itself and i
think

02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
if we go forward we have to have some
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
clarification on the intent of what it
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
means by humanization opening line
 
02:39:11.110 --> 02:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:12.710 --> 02:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
02:39:15.510 --> 02:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so there was
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
question about that when the bill was
 
02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:18.710 align:start position:0%
question about that when the bill was
passed

02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:39:19.670 --> 02:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
up until
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
he asked the question and he's okay now
 
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
um there was there was question on that
 
02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
when the bill was passed um
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
there was a faction of the public that
 
02:39:31.030 --> 02:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
wanted it to apply to all vaccines and
 
02:39:32.389 --> 02:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
there was a faction that wanted it
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
applied to just coven 19. and when um it
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
came down to the wire and the ag was
 
02:39:40.389 --> 02:39:40.399 align:start position:0%
asked his opinion on it he said that
 
02:39:40.399 --> 02:39:41.429 align:start position:0%
asked his opinion on it he said that
because

02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
the second sentence starts with
 
02:39:43.359 --> 02:39:44.710 align:start position:0%
the second sentence starts with
accordingly

02:39:44.710 --> 02:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the implication is that it only
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
okay not asking for an amendment i'm
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
just asking uh this is the time if one
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
person wants to work on it with others
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
everything goes out the door on this on
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
the eight so i don't see anything
 
02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative webber you had a question
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
of the chair
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
it was actually the chair and others uh
 
02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
about 1439 might i inquire about
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
availability of the subcommittee for at
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
a particular time yes you may thank you
 
02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.070 align:start position:0%
a particular time yes you may thank you
uh

02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
the commit subcommittee as as detailed
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
by uh the chair and others
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
was myself representatives leon gay
 
02:40:31.680 --> 02:40:32.870 align:start position:0%
was myself representatives leon gay
kelsey

02:40:32.870 --> 02:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
kelsey
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
cushman woods nutteruppum and mckay
 
02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:38.469 align:start position:0%
cushman woods nutteruppum and mckay
and

02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is the bill relative to hospital
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
visitation policies with a particular
 
02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
emphasis on end of life but also
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
throughout life and i was wondering if i
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
could schedule that at 8 30 on a tuesday
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
morning so that people would not have to
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
make a s
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
a special trip in
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
to consider that does anybody object to
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
that because i would do it not next
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
tuesday when we're under the gun with a
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
lot of execs and i think people might be
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
preparing for that but the next tuesday
 
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.349 align:start position:0%
preparing for that but the next tuesday
and

02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:15.670 --> 02:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
i could then prepare calendar notices
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
for that if that's okay
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
hearing no objection i'm going to check
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
with representative kelsey since she's
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
out today but
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh we we've got a pretty good critical
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
mass at this point so
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
um i i as the clerk have a request if
 
02:41:37.190 --> 02:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
someone could substitute for the clerk
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
during that meeting and take
 
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
the notes
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
the normal procedure on subcommittees is
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
one of the members and it may be the
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
chair but it may be another member does
 
02:41:50.790 --> 02:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
take that and the
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
minute taking for subcommittees is very
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
minimal it's simply recording decisions
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's not recording as you do every
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
single comment by every single person
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
which is a great relief to anybody doing
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
that duty
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
but i will ensure that that's done and
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
the clerk may
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
be at leisure
 
02:42:14.630 --> 02:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
so representative weber um perhaps after
 
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
hearing from representative kelsey who's
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
with us today uh then you would take
 
02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
care of calendaring thank you so much
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
the other question i have to
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
raise is on the first bill we heard 12
 
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.590 align:start position:0%
raise is on the first bill we heard 12
24

02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
24
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative baldazzaro
 
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
is presented by representative cushman
 
02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:36.190 align:start position:0%
is presented by representative cushman
prohibiting

02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
employers and public space people from
 
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
discriminating on back status and
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
several other things
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
again i'm not asking and i'm i'm not
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
making anything except if
 
02:42:53.670 --> 02:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
there is a an individual or a group who
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
wishes to write an amendment to this
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
this bill too will go out the door on
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
the 8th with or without you so just just
 
02:43:03.830 --> 02:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
inform me
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
does it look like there's anybody who's
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
was this a question that we got the
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
answer to because i marked two places
 
02:43:25.750 --> 02:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether we were
 
02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:27.349 align:start position:0%
whether we were
specifying

02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
specifying
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
which immunization
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
that would be a question to anybody in
 
02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
the room other than me please
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah did that get solved already
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
in hb 1224
 
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
yes that bill is specified
 
02:43:46.469 --> 02:43:46.479 align:start position:0%
i believe yes
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
that one is
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
so it looks like there isn't but should
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
someone on the drive home say
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
you want to write something wonderful
 
02:44:00.389 --> 02:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
and get a group together just let me
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
know that's all so i can plan my work um
 
02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:05.429 align:start position:0%
know that's all so i can plan my work um
that

02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:06.790 --> 02:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
looks like
almost

02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
almost
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
it representative soloway
 
02:44:12.389 --> 02:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i have a piece of
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
information that just arrived may i
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry is it like late breaking news
 
02:44:25.349 --> 02:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
this is late breaking news this is from
 
02:44:28.630 --> 02:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
my uh informant at the cleveland clinic
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.670 --> 02:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine mandates are being removed
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the near future in florida and
 
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
colorado they're going to be removing
 
02:44:45.830 --> 02:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine mandates and mask mandates
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
essentially the pandemic is considered
 
02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
over and that will be going into effect
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
toward the end of this month of february
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
if i may add to that a week ago friday i
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
informed my domestic partner
 
02:45:03.030 --> 02:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
well it's over you can watch the numbers
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
drop beginning today the news media are
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
in fact reporting that hospitalizations
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
are way down for complex reasons the
 
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
deaths are going down
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
and we're probably seeing the end of
 
02:45:20.150 --> 02:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
omicron currently omicron b is still out
 
02:45:21.910 --> 02:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
there we don't know what that's going to
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
be like but it's very likely that we're
 
02:45:24.319 --> 02:45:25.269 align:start position:0%
be like but it's very likely that we're
now

02:45:25.269 --> 02:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
past the crisis
 
02:45:29.429 --> 02:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
and that may affect our decisions on
 
02:45:31.510 --> 02:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you mr chairman this
 
02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
is why the chair kept these bills that
 
02:45:35.910 --> 02:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
are early bills as late as i could to
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
see what happens and since you are an
 
02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:40.070 align:start position:0%
see what happens and since you are an
epidemiologist

02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
would you all buy lunch for us given
 
02:45:45.269 --> 02:45:45.279 align:start position:0%

thank you um
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative mckay
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
received copies of the mental health
 
02:45:59.030 --> 02:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and a supplement from dhhs
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%

by then

um

03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
this bill inserts language into the
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
residential care and health facility
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
licensing chapter
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
so it only applies to patients admitted
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
to a facility those facilities that we
 
03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:46.710 align:start position:0%
to a facility those facilities that we
discussed

03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:37:46.720 --> 03:37:48.309 align:start position:0%
discussed
on

03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:37:50.229 --> 03:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
a previous bill
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
would be nursing homes hospitals
 
03:37:57.190 --> 03:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.190 --> 03:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
day surgery centers
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
so anything that falls under that
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
the premise of the bill
 
03:38:08.399 --> 03:38:10.070 align:start position:0%
the premise of the bill
is

03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
we live in a
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
culture of increasing
 
03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
hostility towards people who
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
make a medical decision to not
 
03:38:25.110 --> 03:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
participate in vaccination
 
03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:26.710 align:start position:0%
participate in vaccination
and

03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
i have mentioned previously that
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
from my background as a nurse
 
03:38:34.150 --> 03:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
i took my code of ethics seriously and
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
when i was told it's part of my
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to advocate for patient
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
self-determination that
 
03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:44.070 align:start position:0%
self-determination that
i

03:38:44.070 --> 03:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:45.269 --> 03:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
i took that
 
03:38:45.279 --> 03:38:47.910 align:start position:0%
i took that
wholeheartedly

03:38:47.910 --> 03:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
um the american medical association
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
recommends not refusing
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
care to patients who
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
decline vaccination in a way that
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
discriminates based on a class of people
 
03:39:03.990 --> 03:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
they do encourage making adjustments in
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
the manner of serving them if they feel
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
set aside for unvaccinated or having
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
them come in for visits at a certain
 
03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
time of day if they feel that that's
 
03:39:17.920 --> 03:39:19.110 align:start position:0%
time of day if they feel that that's
necessary

03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
so the conversation in the literature
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
medical ethics literature has changed
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
since i graduated nursing school
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
during that time medical ethicists were
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
saying it's absolutely a doctor's duty
 
03:39:38.070 --> 03:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
to continue seeing unvaccinated patients
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
even in primary care settings not only
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
in emergency care
 
03:39:45.570 --> 03:39:45.580 align:start position:0%
and now there's a shift in the culture
 
03:39:45.580 --> 03:39:47.189 align:start position:0%
and now there's a shift in the culture
[Music]

03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
of medicine to not only deny care to
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated but
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
there is some interest in the
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of using shaming
 
03:39:56.479 --> 03:39:58.469 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of using shaming
and

03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
um encouraging vaccination
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
so there's been a real change in how
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
these people are approached um when it
 
03:40:13.349 --> 03:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
comes to health care
 
03:40:13.359 --> 03:40:14.150 align:start position:0%
comes to health care
so

03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
for me it's just another representation
 
03:40:18.469 --> 03:40:18.479 align:start position:0%
of how far medicine has fallen
 
03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
as a practice where doctors can refuse
 
03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
patient care based on a medical decision
 
03:40:26.550 --> 03:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
people decline vaccinations for all
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons religious moral ethical
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
or based on their assessment of benefit
 
03:40:33.189 --> 03:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
versus risk
 
03:40:35.510 --> 03:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
we believe in informed consent right
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
as health care providers doctors and
 
03:40:39.750 --> 03:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
nurses are expected to ensure patients
 
03:40:41.429 --> 03:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
have informed consent
 
03:40:41.439 --> 03:40:42.229 align:start position:0%
have informed consent
but

03:40:42.229 --> 03:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:44.389 --> 03:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
how does that add up when we decide that
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
their decision is unacceptable and say
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
well if that's your decision we can't
 
03:40:49.990 --> 03:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
treat you
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's not impo in really providing
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
informed consent or acknowledging
 
03:40:56.950 --> 03:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
patient self-determination
 
03:40:56.960 --> 03:40:58.469 align:start position:0%
patient self-determination
so

03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
if an immuno-compromised patient refuses
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
to take an immunostimulator to reduce
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
their risk of infection
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
would a doctor refuse them
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
because they are at increased risk of
 
03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
infection and therefore it increased
 
03:41:12.950 --> 03:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
risk of
 
03:41:15.030 --> 03:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
passing on that infection
 
03:41:15.040 --> 03:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
passing on that infection
so

03:41:15.990 --> 03:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:17.830 --> 03:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
if a doctor wouldn't do that why would
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
we refuse someone who doesn't take a
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's the same premise
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
how how about morbidly obese patients
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
who refuse to change their diet or
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
diabetics who don't take their insulin
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
and end up with infected leg wounds that
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
nurses have to care for daily
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
putting them at risk of mrsa and other
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
antibiotic resistant bacterial
 
03:41:43.269 --> 03:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
infections you know we have to get right
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
up personal
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
in our you know sometimes get our faces
 
03:41:48.389 --> 03:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
in these things
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
and despite the damage to our backs and
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
the risk of infection that we face
 
03:41:54.790 --> 03:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
we don our ppe and we take care of those
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
patients we don't turn them away and we
 
03:41:58.150 --> 03:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
take care of them with love and
 
03:41:58.160 --> 03:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
take care of them with love and
compassion

03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
the bill just says you can't deny care
 
03:42:06.630 --> 03:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't doesn't mean that if a
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
patient is combative or
 
03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:12.150 align:start position:0%
patient is combative or
um

03:42:12.150 --> 03:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
for other reasons
 
03:42:18.389 --> 03:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
that you would deny care that you can't
 
03:42:20.790 --> 03:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
um if we had a robust alternative health
 
03:42:24.150 --> 03:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
care system in new hampshire
 
03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
i might
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
i might say that this bill isn't
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
necessary but where we have a heavily
 
03:42:31.510 --> 03:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
corporate monolithic health care system
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
especially where hospitals are concerned
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the area that this bill
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm concerned about most nursing
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
homes don't have any vaccine
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
requirements and don't discriminate on
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination status i'm really concerned
 
03:42:51.990 --> 03:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
about hospitals there have been some
 
03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
cases around the country a
 
03:42:55.269 --> 03:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
three-year-old was
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
denied heart treatment because parents
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
the parents were unvaccinated
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's just a headline and that was
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
actually in europe
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
but an unvaccinated patient of a boston
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
hospital was denied a heart transplant
 
03:43:11.269 --> 03:43:11.279 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't vaccinated
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
and if you just
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
search the internet you'll find similar
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
cases and i have received
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
reports from
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
the general public
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
of parents being
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
let go from specialists that their
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
children needed
 
03:43:30.710 --> 03:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
from being dismissed from
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
private practices
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
based on vaccination status and this
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't apply to private practices
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think there is some more
 
03:43:40.389 --> 03:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
room for lateral movement for patients
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
to shop around and find a different
 
03:43:41.760 --> 03:43:43.990 align:start position:0%
to shop around and find a different
doctor

03:43:43.990 --> 03:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
03:43:45.830 --> 03:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm open to
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
having that discussion if we if that's
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
something the committee wants to include
 
03:43:51.429 --> 03:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's about it
 
03:43:57.110 --> 03:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you very
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
much representative cushing for taking
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
so you were talking about hospitals and
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
access to hospitals
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
but as far as i know the department of
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
health and human services is involved in
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
only one hospital
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
being the new hampshire
 
03:44:16.399 --> 03:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
being the new hampshire
hospital

03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:44:21.670 --> 03:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
the other hospitals are all entities
 
03:44:25.189 --> 03:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
unto themselves and while they may have
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
to comply with certain department
 
03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
to comply with certain department
regulations

03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.349 --> 03:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's not the department of health and
 
03:44:33.750 --> 03:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
human services that's requiring anything
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
it would be the entity themselves
 
03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
so how does this apply in those cases
 
03:44:40.160 --> 03:44:41.110 align:start position:0%
so how does this apply in those cases
so

03:44:41.110 --> 03:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
um this bill isn't just specific to the
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:44:48.389 --> 03:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
it's to all
 
03:44:51.189 --> 03:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
medical facilities that are regulated by
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:44:52.800 --> 03:44:54.150 align:start position:0%
that um
statute

03:44:54.150 --> 03:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:44:54.160 --> 03:44:54.990 align:start position:0%
statute
it's

03:44:54.990 --> 03:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
151 sorry do i have do i have the wrong
 
03:44:57.600 --> 03:44:58.469 align:start position:0%
151 sorry do i have do i have the wrong
bill

03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
what bill are we on one zero zero three
 
03:45:04.469 --> 03:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
ah i have the wrong bill okay my
 
03:45:07.189 --> 03:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
deepest apologies this is what i
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
get for being late to class and my
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
apologies thank you for the
 
03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
clarification but hold that thought
 
03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
because you're on a good roll i will
 
03:45:16.630 --> 03:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
hold that phone okay representative
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
woods yeah thank you mr chair and thanks
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh just a query
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
about the
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh rather broad-based
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
inclusion i'm trying to think of
 
03:45:30.550 --> 03:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
potential exceptions uh say an oncology
 
03:45:33.510 --> 03:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
service that has people who are
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
really immunosuppressed and then
 
03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
not to being able to say
 
03:45:41.429 --> 03:45:41.439 align:start position:0%
well no in this facility we need to have
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
everybody vaccinated to care for these
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
particularly immune compressed or
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
compromised patients similarly
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
like two of my very close friends here
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
in concord have heart transplants
 
03:45:52.479 --> 03:45:53.750 align:start position:0%
in concord have heart transplants
and

03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
they can't even with vaccines they can't
 
03:45:58.950 --> 03:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
get uh their titers up they have to be
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
protected and if they had open clinics
 
03:46:04.950 --> 03:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh without some regulation uh
 
03:46:09.269 --> 03:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh that would be rather significant
 
03:46:10.790 --> 03:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
 
03:46:10.800 --> 03:46:12.150 align:start position:0%
uh is there any
exceptions

03:46:12.150 --> 03:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
for this in the way you it doesn't look
 
03:46:16.469 --> 03:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
like there's any exception for anybody
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
03:46:18.800 --> 03:46:19.670 align:start position:0%
for anything
so

03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
it just states that they can't
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
discriminate they can't deny care or
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
services based on vaccination status so
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
they could still
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to separate appointment
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
times and have all the unvaccinated
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
patients come at the end of the day or
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know only be seen on a certain day
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
they they could still make policies like
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
that if they wanted to
 
03:46:40.239 --> 03:46:42.309 align:start position:0%
that if they wanted to
um

03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:44.070 --> 03:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
but again
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
currently there's still no guarantee
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
even that the employees in that facility
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
won't be vaccinated given the the
 
03:46:53.349 --> 03:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions available
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative canark thank you very
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
much sort of as a follow-on i um
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate and agree that you we
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be discriminating whether
 
03:47:04.150 --> 03:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to care for somebody uh you
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
know we
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
we still take care of people who have
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know our smokers and get lung cancer
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
we take care of them
 
03:47:12.389 --> 03:47:12.399 align:start position:0%
the question is sometimes there's
 
03:47:13.750 --> 03:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
medical issues for example you brought
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
up heart transplants and there's a
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
number of
 
03:47:17.910 --> 03:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh factors that go into deciding who
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
gets a heart because we don't have
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
enough of them
 
03:47:22.950 --> 03:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
and or liver transplants if i remember
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
right we don't usually do liver
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
transplants and people will continue to
 
03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:26.309 align:start position:0%
transplants and people will continue to
drink

03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
drink
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh because we know it's just gonna fail
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
um so would there would it be reasonable
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
to say something in the order of
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh based on a patient's vaccination
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
status comma unless there are medical
 
03:47:41.670 --> 03:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
indic medical reasons to do so or that's
 
03:47:43.110 --> 03:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
kind of vague too i can't figure out a
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
good wording but there are some times
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
when this might possibly come in i think
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
it'd be rare
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of a decision making for
 
03:47:52.389 --> 03:47:52.399 align:start position:0%
something that would be
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
medical though not because you didn't
 
03:47:55.189 --> 03:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
like it because they didn't get
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated but because of the increased
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
medical risk or something along that
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
hill could i i'm not sure how to word it
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
what's your thoughts on that one
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
um i'm open to discussing it uh
 
03:48:09.670 --> 03:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
like you i i don't see it
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
i see it being a really rare occurrence
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
where that would be the only factor that
 
03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:14.389 align:start position:0%
where that would be the only factor that
would

03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
preclude a medical
 
03:48:18.469 --> 03:48:18.479 align:start position:0%
treatment or
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
procedure from going forward
 
03:48:20.960 --> 03:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
procedure from going forward
um

03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:24.150 --> 03:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
but we yeah i'd be open to discuss it
 
03:48:24.160 --> 03:48:26.229 align:start position:0%
but we yeah i'd be open to discuss it
certainly

03:48:26.229 --> 03:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
follow up um i'll i'll try to think back
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
but would you believe that back when we
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
first had hiv that was an issue because
 
03:48:33.429 --> 03:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
we faced it with things that were
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
elective like hardware removals from
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
ankle fractures and the concern of
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
increased risk and we spent a lot of
 
03:48:40.479 --> 03:48:41.269 align:start position:0%
increased risk and we spent a lot of
time

03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the hospital trying to figure out how
 
03:48:44.150 --> 03:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
do we handle that situation i'll try to
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
think back to figure out how we worded
 
03:48:47.110 --> 03:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
some of these things and get back to you
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
on it i'll work with you
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
and now the chair calls on the honorable
 
03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
gentlelady from cheshire county with a
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
well and i know it was on 1003 because
 
03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative kenner really made me ask
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
the question that i was going to ask
 
03:49:06.399 --> 03:49:08.469 align:start position:0%
the question that i was going to ask
about

03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:49:12.150 --> 03:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
those procedures where we deny for all
 
03:49:14.070 --> 03:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of different factors and they may
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
be obesity they may be refusable to stop
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
drinking they may be
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:21.349 align:start position:0%
you know
scarce

03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
scarce
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
medical resources
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
and you have to
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
decide as ethically as possible
 
03:49:31.510 --> 03:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
how you are going to
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
not only do no harm but do the most
 
03:49:33.279 --> 03:49:34.389 align:start position:0%
not only do no harm but do the most
benefit

03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:49:37.189 --> 03:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
and so i i think we were driving at the
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
same thing so i thank you for your
 
03:49:40.790 --> 03:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
willingness to consider that
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
representatives excuse me
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
you may answer if you wish
 
03:49:46.870 --> 03:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so my thought is that
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
not being vaccinated in and of itself
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know a year ago when there was no
 
03:49:56.160 --> 03:49:57.429 align:start position:0%
you know a year ago when there was no
vaccine

03:49:57.429 --> 03:49:57.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:49:59.030 --> 03:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
not being vaccinated wouldn't preclude
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
obtaining a procedure um like a heart
 
03:50:06.150 --> 03:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
transplant or anything so i don't i
 
03:50:07.830 --> 03:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
personally don't
 
03:50:10.710 --> 03:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
think it's an acceptable reason to not
 
03:50:10.720 --> 03:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
think it's an acceptable reason to not
um

03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:14.070 --> 03:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
even elective procedures to not go
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
forward with them
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house had me do a
 
03:50:21.030 --> 03:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
deep dive research on the issue of
 
03:50:21.040 --> 03:50:22.710 align:start position:0%
deep dive research on the issue of
transplants

03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
transplants
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that what i
 
03:50:27.269 --> 03:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
learned among other things
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
was that there were many factors that
 
03:50:32.150 --> 03:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
would push an individual up or down on
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
the transplant list
 
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
one of which would be
 
03:50:39.750 --> 03:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
um the likelihood of survival of this
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
individual in receiving the transplant
 
03:50:44.389 --> 03:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
versus that individual
 
03:50:47.269 --> 03:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that would you then believe that
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the only answer but it's a
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
valid answer in the question
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
that lack of vaccination status could be
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
seen by some reasonable people
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
as something that would push them down
 
03:51:04.550 --> 03:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:07.030 --> 03:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis
 
03:51:09.269 --> 03:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
yes okay you can see that
 
03:51:11.670 --> 03:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh thank you mr
 
03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
representative soloway uh thank you mr
chairman

03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
and representative cushman thank you for
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a two-part
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
question i do want to point out however
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
that we have visitors in the gallery
 
03:51:23.910 --> 03:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
and we are being on our best behavior
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
we've not done it this year but we can
 
03:51:25.600 --> 03:51:27.189 align:start position:0%
we've not done it this year but we can
try

03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
try
 
03:51:27.199 --> 03:51:28.150 align:start position:0%
try
um

03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
are not
 
03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners and organizations already
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
bound by their ethical systems
 
03:51:39.429 --> 03:51:39.439 align:start position:0%
uh i would assume that they are but the
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
ethics around how we treat unvaccinated
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
people has changed a lot in the last
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
year or two
 
03:51:46.880 --> 03:51:48.229 align:start position:0%
year or two
so

03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:49.830 --> 03:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
an increased tendency toward
 
03:51:56.309 --> 03:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.630 --> 03:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
a new understanding of what
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
the ethical way to treat them would be
 
03:52:04.389 --> 03:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
okay a quick follow-up follow-up um i i
 
03:52:06.309 --> 03:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
was moved by
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
of your presentation
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
of the numbers of diagnoses
 
03:52:15.910 --> 03:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
that might require this kind of
 
03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
that might require this kind of
protection

03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
protection
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
i thought that you did a really good job
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
on that but the way the bill is written
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
would this not open up the door to add a
 
03:52:30.229 --> 03:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
longer and longer list of diagnoses
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
that require protection we've seen this
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
with other bills that we've dealt with
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
in this session
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
in particular on the bill on migraines
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh would we
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
open up the door there to a long series
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
of diagnoses would we not be opening up
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
the same door here
 
03:52:52.229 --> 03:52:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't add a list of diagnoses there's
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
no language for that in the bill it's
 
03:52:58.800 --> 03:52:59.990 align:start position:0%
no language for that in the bill it's
just

03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:01.269 align:start position:0%
just
um

03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
that there's a prohibition on refusal to
 
03:53:03.359 --> 03:53:05.030 align:start position:0%
that there's a prohibition on refusal to
care

03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
refusal to provide care services based
 
03:53:09.189 --> 03:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
on vaccination status
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
you could generalize it
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
rather than just vaccines
 
03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
you could come up with language on
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah sure i mean i'd be open to discuss
 
03:53:24.399 --> 03:53:25.590 align:start position:0%
yeah sure i mean i'd be open to discuss
um

03:53:25.590 --> 03:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:27.189 --> 03:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know a different way to word it sure
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much representative uh
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
before we continue the chair wishes to
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
reconsider a previous remark that
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps was not worded well that yes we
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
are on our best behavior and this is
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
something this committee has noted for
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for the look i got from
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
a one-time second grade teacher that
 
03:53:51.990 --> 03:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.830 --> 03:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:53:57.670 --> 03:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
that clarification and welcome thank you
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
for joining us today
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
these questions and i appreciate the
 
03:54:06.389 --> 03:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
other questions around denial of care
 
03:54:09.429 --> 03:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable if this list of
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
diagnoses that are excluded
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
is written so that a patient with
 
03:54:17.830 --> 03:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
with with a disease that has a lot of
 
03:54:19.750 --> 03:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
immune compromise
 
03:54:22.469 --> 03:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
say somebody with that needs treatment
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
in one of these oncology clinics
 
03:54:27.189 --> 03:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
or needs to be seen by the transplant
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
center perhaps they already have a
 
03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
center perhaps they already have a
transplant

03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
transplant
 
03:54:32.150 --> 03:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with excluding
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
those patients from care even though the
 
03:54:37.189 --> 03:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
other patients with the same diagnosis
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
sorry i probably didn't worry that
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
clearly i'm saying can you ask again
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm gonna back up and rewind
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
the tape uh we're looking at some of
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
these patient groups that are very
 
03:54:55.199 --> 03:54:56.389 align:start position:0%
these patient groups that are very
vulnerable

03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and without treatment whether those who
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
any of those patients without treatment
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
may end up either much sicker or die
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the idea of
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
protecting those patients who are
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and potentially excluding the
 
03:55:15.269 --> 03:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated are we are you comfortable
 
03:55:18.070 --> 03:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
denying life-saving care to somebody
 
03:55:19.590 --> 03:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
simply because others with the same
 
03:55:19.600 --> 03:55:21.189 align:start position:0%
simply because others with the same
diagnosis

03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
might be at higher risk from covet
 
03:55:22.960 --> 03:55:24.389 align:start position:0%
might be at higher risk from covet
exposure

03:55:24.389 --> 03:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
03:55:26.630 --> 03:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
oh no i am not comfortable with that
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:55:37.110 --> 03:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
well we're halfway home we've got the
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
microphone in front of you the next step
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
why is it i'm the only one that has
 
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
trouble with these things
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
i can't we hide it better uh i know i
 
03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:48.389 align:start position:0%
i can't we hide it better uh i know i
know

03:55:48.389 --> 03:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of your testimony you
 
03:55:51.910 --> 03:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
indicated this bill is really like the
 
03:55:53.590 --> 03:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
other bill we looked at that was
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
really aimed at health care facilities
 
03:55:57.510 --> 03:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
nursing homes etc
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
and yet the wording of the bill says
 
03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
providers which seems to indicate
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
individual private practice etc would
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
this bill be easier for people to
 
03:56:06.560 --> 03:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
this bill be easier for people to
understand

03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
if that one word
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
where it says providers was just simply
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:19.269 --> 03:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of an individual press so
 
03:56:25.189 --> 03:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
under that statute i believe provider
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
includes facilities
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
under the arts by the way i'll say 151.
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
but it also includes individual private
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are
 
03:56:35.840 --> 03:56:37.030 align:start position:0%
practitioners who are
one-on-one

03:56:37.030 --> 03:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
one-on-one
 
03:56:38.469 --> 03:56:38.479 align:start position:0%
you know particularly in behavioral
 
03:56:38.479 --> 03:56:39.510 align:start position:0%
you know particularly in behavioral
health

03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think some
 
03:56:42.389 --> 03:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
are perfectly aware that they have an
 
03:56:44.070 --> 03:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
attitude about vaccination where they
 
03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't be as much help
 
03:56:47.349 --> 03:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
patient as someone else would who's not
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
kept the same attitude about it so that
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
you might
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
want to do that but i mean i i thought
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
you were aiming at facilities that
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
facilities couldn't turn people away
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
because of vaccination status not any
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
individual practitioner
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
i personally
 
03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
can't imagine doing it i i'm very strong
 
03:57:08.800 --> 03:57:09.590 align:start position:0%
can't imagine doing it i i'm very strong
on

03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:57:11.110 --> 03:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
masks and the other but i would not
 
03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
refuse to see somebody who was not
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated representative connerk
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
yes but um
 
03:57:18.790 --> 03:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
this camera i'm going to make i'm not
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
going to make it a question 151 does
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to do with facilities it's not
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
providers so since it is in 151 she's
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
got the right place i think
 
03:57:29.830 --> 03:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
so you you support the idea of keeping
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
that word providers
 
03:57:35.110 --> 03:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh no crosstalk until the uh that's okay
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
until the executive session i don't know
 
03:57:38.950 --> 03:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
why but that's the rule representative
 
03:57:38.960 --> 03:57:41.510 align:start position:0%
why but that's the rule representative
merchant

03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
and also thank you representative
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
um just for clarification would you
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
believe that in
 
03:57:49.920 --> 03:57:51.590 align:start position:0%
believe that in
151

03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
151
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
colon 21
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
section 4
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
it says health care provider means any
 
03:57:59.349 --> 03:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
person corporation facility
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%

03:58:19.510 --> 03:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i would believe that and
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to make it so
 
03:58:28.870 --> 03:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
that no one has refused care for
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination status so if that's an
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.110 --> 03:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
or a facility
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
protection for these patients and make
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
sure they can still receive care
 
03:58:42.080 --> 03:58:46.950 align:start position:0%
sure they can still receive care
follow-up

03:58:46.950 --> 03:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.960 --> 03:58:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
matt

03:58:47.910 --> 03:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
matt
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
inquirer i guess is what is the impetus
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the spill because you have in my
 
03:58:52.080 --> 03:58:53.189 align:start position:0%
of the spill because you have in my
opinion

03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
so to hit the nail on the head ethically
 
03:58:56.950 --> 03:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
as a clinician
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
03:59:00.550 --> 03:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
able to in a sense refuse treatment to a
 
03:59:00.560 --> 03:59:01.910 align:start position:0%
able to in a sense refuse treatment to a
patient

03:59:01.910 --> 03:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm not quite sure exactly what is
 
03:59:05.510 --> 03:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
triggering the bill to begin with what
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we're trying to
 
03:59:06.880 --> 03:59:07.830 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we're trying to
solve

03:59:07.830 --> 03:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
solve
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
because from an ethical point of view
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
providers are bound to take care of the
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
patient regardless of their status
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure exactly why this is
 
03:59:20.070 --> 03:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
coming forth to this committee
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh well
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
i've received reports from many parents
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
here's one dr
 
03:59:29.199 --> 03:59:30.870 align:start position:0%
here's one dr
al

03:59:30.870 --> 03:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
al
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
i'll take out the name is a wonderful
 
03:59:33.279 --> 03:59:34.790 align:start position:0%
i'll take out the name is a wonderful
dermatologist

03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
dermatologist
 
03:59:37.590 --> 03:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
who specializes in dermatology
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
um called to make an appointment the
 
03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
voice message
 
03:59:43.269 --> 03:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
said you would not be seen if
 
03:59:43.279 --> 03:59:44.950 align:start position:0%
said you would not be seen if
unvaccinated

03:59:44.950 --> 03:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
03:59:46.950 --> 03:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
um here's another one we got kicked out
 
03:59:46.960 --> 03:59:47.830 align:start position:0%
um here's another one we got kicked out
of

03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
my son's pcp for not being vaccinated
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
names the
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
primary care doctor
 
03:59:58.469 --> 03:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
here's another one
 
04:00:00.309 --> 04:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
we got kicked out of
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:06.229 --> 04:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
for not being vaccinated we got kicked
 
04:00:06.239 --> 04:00:07.110 align:start position:0%
for not being vaccinated we got kicked
out

04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
i have like several
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
um and those were just for the last two
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
days when i asked and those are
 
04:00:15.910 --> 04:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
those were mostly pcps and specialists
 
04:00:15.920 --> 04:00:16.790 align:start position:0%
those were mostly pcps and specialists
um

04:00:16.790 --> 04:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
and like i said that there is
 
04:00:18.880 --> 04:00:19.830 align:start position:0%
and like i said that there is
a

04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
more free market
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
practice and i think there's more
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
options to find a different primary care
 
04:00:27.199 --> 04:00:28.710 align:start position:0%
options to find a different primary care
doctor

04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
04:00:28.720 --> 04:00:29.830 align:start position:0%
doctor
so

04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's why i think that the facilities
 
04:00:34.710 --> 04:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
where people would be admitted which is
 
04:00:36.389 --> 04:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
what this speaks to
 
04:00:39.189 --> 04:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
are the ones that i would like to ensure
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
won't refuse patience on that
 
04:00:44.309 --> 04:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
um i have the chair has a question um i
 
04:00:44.319 --> 04:00:45.429 align:start position:0%
um i have the chair has a question um i
know

04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
that the facility of which i'm ceo
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh can and occasionally does
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
dismiss patients from the practice
 
04:00:54.800 --> 04:00:56.870 align:start position:0%
dismiss patients from the practice
and

04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
of course we give them 30 days to find
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
someone else if they can and all the
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
forwarding of medical records and
 
04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
forwarding of medical records and
whatnot

04:01:06.710 --> 04:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
would this be a carve-out saying that we
 
04:01:12.229 --> 04:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
can do that but not for this specific
 
04:01:12.239 --> 04:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
can do that but not for this specific
reason

04:01:14.630 --> 04:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:01:16.870 --> 04:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
because we can dismiss them
 
04:01:18.389 --> 04:01:18.399 align:start position:0%
as a facility
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
and my facility does it on the say so of
 
04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
one of my several pcps
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
is this saying we can do that but not
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chairman
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't apply to
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
your business
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
but yes the
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
the um facilities licensed under that
 
04:01:42.150 --> 04:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
statute 151
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
they would still be able to dismiss a
 
04:01:45.510 --> 04:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
patient for other reasons could they
 
04:01:47.990 --> 04:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
dismiss for this reason no
 
04:01:49.990 --> 04:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay so this is a carve out of which
 
04:01:52.229 --> 04:01:52.239 align:start position:0%
there could be some others say you don't
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.189 --> 04:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
i mean this this could lead to a second
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
one could it not
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
a second a second carve out
 
04:02:05.830 --> 04:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
you must you can dismiss people for any
 
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
reason you want except for
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine status and then next year for
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
another status and so on well the so
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
this is in the patient bill of rights
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
and there are already you know reasons
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
that patients can't be denied care under
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
that um they can't be denied or
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
dismissed if they
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
um have medicaid they can't if
 
04:02:29.429 --> 04:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
they um can't pay
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
they can't be denied based on their race
 
04:02:34.070 --> 04:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
or gender or
 
04:02:34.080 --> 04:02:34.870 align:start position:0%
or gender or
um

04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
age are you saying that a patient cannot
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
be dismissed for the patient's steadfast
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
refusal to pay the copay
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
that's for these facilities that's what
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
right and that's what this applies to
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
i've got a note handed up here that john
 
04:02:55.600 --> 04:02:56.870 align:start position:0%
i've got a note handed up here that john
williams

04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
williams
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
who does not just work for the dhhs but
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
is also a font of wisdom
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
is willing to speak to this issue
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the only drawback is we don't have
 
04:03:06.880 --> 04:03:08.550 align:start position:0%
and the only drawback is we don't have
one

04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
while he's doing that um
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
i just know from having numbers of
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
family members who are
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
career medical providers the oaths that
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
they take
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they really do lean heavily towards
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
treating people irrespective of so thank
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%

04:03:52.550 --> 04:03:52.560 align:start position:0%

the bill uh you know for allowing us to

04:04:14.229 --> 04:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
limited capacity we're here to provide

and i have to say that representative
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
weber always attends the right class in
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
the right school because i actually
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
think you were probably perhaps on the
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
right issue relative to the placement of
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
this law within our facilities licensing
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
statute under 151. if you read the
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
language and i'm actually going to have
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
janice read us the language starting on
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
no health care provider licensed or
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
registered to provide services in this
 
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
state may refuse to provide care or
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
services based on a patient's
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
and miss emery do we license providers
 
04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
under this section or facilities
 
04:04:57.279 --> 04:04:59.110 align:start position:0%
under this section or facilities
we

04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
do not license
 
04:05:01.439 --> 04:05:03.269 align:start position:0%
do not license
providers

04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you so the correct placement for
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
this if the consideration is to having
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
it apply to
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh the provider's licensure as opposed
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
to the facility licensure and it's
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
clearly written so that it applies to
 
04:05:16.080 --> 04:05:17.590 align:start position:0%
clearly written so that it applies to
providers

04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so therefore the the appropriate
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
placement at least as it relates to
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
physicians and surgeons would be under
 
04:05:26.150 --> 04:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
rsa chapter 329 and just putting it out
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
there for your consideration and open to
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
dr representative woods
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:05:37.750 --> 04:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
under general practice
 
04:05:45.830 --> 04:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard that the physicians and
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
facilities are refusing because of this
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
issue and therefore you're right
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
physicians at least from the standpoint
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
are controlled by the board of medicine
 
04:05:54.150 --> 04:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
and have a certain standard at which
 
04:05:55.349 --> 04:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
they can practice
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
have any of these been brought to the
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
board of medicine
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
that we heard i had my hand up to ask
 
04:06:01.840 --> 04:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
that we heard i had my hand up to ask
the

04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor but
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
i was not able to get in
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
or would you have an opinion as to
 
04:06:12.469 --> 04:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
whether this
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
would be the venue of the board of
 
04:06:14.640 --> 04:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
would be the venue of the board of
medicine

04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
if a physician were in fact refute or a
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
facility was refusing
 
04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know physician visa borough medicine
 
04:06:24.150 --> 04:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like that would be the
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
avenue to to start
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.479 --> 04:06:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay so realistically the question that
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
was posed at the department as i filter
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
out all of the first one do we have any
 
04:06:41.269 --> 04:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
information uh from the office of
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and board of
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
medicine on the frequency of these kind
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
of complaints i do not because that's
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
not our agency it's another agency
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's other members in the
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
audience that i think are very prepared
 
04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
to provide you with that level of
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
background information on that question
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
number one number two is because we're
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:06:59.349 --> 04:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh if you're looking at and and we're
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
just working off the language in the
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
build in front of us that talks about
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
providers that if we're talking about
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
providers and not facilities the
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate location for that would be
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the professional licensure statute
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
and if it is related to physicians and
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
surgeons and looking in anticipation for
 
04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
a question from representative merchant
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
that they are regulated by the board of
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
medicine at least as to those entities
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
there's perhaps other providers that the
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill sponsor may want to include in that
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
list this was not meant to be all
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
exhausted list but we just wanted to
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
identify that the appropriate location
 
04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
should not be in rsa 151 which only
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
licensed facilities and even if you were
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
to consider doing that we would actually
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
suggest other placement as well if
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to go down that route so we
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
hope you don't and uh and again we're
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the bill
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
but in the spirit of trying to get you
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place where it belongs
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be helpful
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
that you've now received this bill in
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
front of you as as drafted
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative cushman would you be able
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
to address representative woods question
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
as to whether such offending
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
providers have been duly reported to the
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woods for the
 
04:08:13.750 --> 04:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
question i
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
do not have
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
information on whether those were
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
but i do know that non-disciplinary
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
action when they investigate complaints
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
if there's no official disciplinary
 
04:08:27.670 --> 04:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
action taken it's not
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
made public
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
so it could be that it has but it's not
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
on the website
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
of actions taken follow-up
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair uh but i guess my
 
04:08:41.110 --> 04:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
real question is do you know if any of
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
these individuals have in fact
 
04:08:45.030 --> 04:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
approached the board of medicine to at
 
04:08:46.710 --> 04:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
least initiate
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
that comment it would still that
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
individual if that were the case if they
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
were no a non-disciplinary action taken
 
04:08:56.070 --> 04:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
that would still be a notification to
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
the patient the patient then would know
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
and would have to get a reason okay for
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
that non-disciplinary reason it you're
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
true it would not be publicized
 
04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh as disciplinary or that that's in the
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
public domain and in fact they're it's i
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
mean every one is published their anyway
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
but uh so
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're not sure
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
no i don't have confirmation that any of
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
them filed complaints with the uh board
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
of medicine
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative merchant
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i also think that
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
kristen cushman has taken the question
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to understand and break it
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
apart there's the facility side
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the provider
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
so in essence what dhhs does is
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
regulates the facility
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore they could talk about the
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
access to the provider who's in the
 
04:09:45.120 --> 04:09:46.229 align:start position:0%
access to the provider who's in the
facility

04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
which is different than a provider who's
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
in the facility so this could
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
allow the facility to grant access it
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the provider who's in that
 
04:09:54.720 --> 04:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the provider who's in that
facility

04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:09:58.389 --> 04:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
has he has an obligation to ethically
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
treat the patient but if they don't back
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
the representative wood's comment
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that go back to the board of
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
medicine as a
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
violation of ethics
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh i wonder if it would um
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
i would i would think so but
 
04:10:14.630 --> 04:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
so where i put this in is the bill of
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
rights right patient bill of rights for
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
patients who are admitted to medical
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
facilities and um now that we've been
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
talking about the phrasing i noticed
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
that it the phrasing of this bill the
 
04:10:31.110 --> 04:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
language deviates from the pattern
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's in that bill of rights
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
all of the other rights of patients
 
04:10:37.750 --> 04:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
start with the patient shall so i wonder
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
if it would be appropriate to amend the
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
bill and make it say the patient shall
 
04:10:45.590 --> 04:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
not be denied care based on
 
04:10:48.149 --> 04:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
04:10:48.159 --> 04:10:50.550 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
follow-up

04:10:50.550 --> 04:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
i totally agree with what you're saying
 
04:10:53.910 --> 04:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's probably better in that
 
04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
location and i think we should also talk
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
about the provider separately maybe in
 
04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
rsa 329 although i'm dangerous about
 
04:11:02.349 --> 04:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
doing that because once we do that in
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
rsa329 that deals only with physicians
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
position assistants it doesn't deal with
 
04:11:08.229 --> 04:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
dentists podiatrists optometrists and so
 
04:11:09.910 --> 04:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
forth so if we go down that road we
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
should be sure we amend all the other
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
rsas dealing with those providers but if
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're willing to work with you on it
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
i would believe that
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
well once again i think we may have gone
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
a long way towards addressing my concern
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
which was
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is very very broad language in a
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
very very specific statute so if you
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
mean it to apply
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
as the patient bill of rights does
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
because it's in this chapter to patients
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
who are in residential care and health
 
04:11:43.040 --> 04:11:44.469 align:start position:0%
who are in residential care and health
facilities

04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
then it ought to say
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
either either use the language proposed
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
by representative merchant or say
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
in several prominent places under this
 
04:11:55.359 --> 04:11:56.469 align:start position:0%
in several prominent places under this
chapter

04:11:56.469 --> 04:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
04:11:59.670 --> 04:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
so that we know that it is limited
 
04:11:59.680 --> 04:12:01.349 align:start position:0%
so that we know that it is limited
to

04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
the facilities but i don't think that's
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
your intent and the language here is
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
very very broad
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
and as as representative merchant has
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
already pointed out
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe that if that is
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
your intent that you need to get into
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
a matter of some delicacy
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
having remembered all the negotiations
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
that had to do with
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
everybody who could prescribe opiates
 
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
which unfortunately
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
included patients that were not only
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
two-legged but four-legged and had very
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
different considerations so luckily
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
you're out of that one but but there are
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of different places in the statute
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
that it has to go
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
and my other question is
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
did you intend
 
04:12:53.760 --> 04:12:54.630 align:start position:0%
did you intend
to

04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
include all vaccination or simply covet
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination because it does not the
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
language here does not restrict to the
 
04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
covert vaccination
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
it would include every single one of the
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations that we have been using
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
for many many years and as the child of
 
04:13:16.309 --> 04:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
a polio survivor
 
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
i am very grateful
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
for the climate in which i was born
 
04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
where everybody went and got the polio
 
04:13:24.399 --> 04:13:25.590 align:start position:0%
where everybody went and got the polio
vaccine

04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
04:13:25.600 --> 04:13:26.469 align:start position:0%
vaccine
so

04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you is it your intent that it
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
apply to everything or just covet thank
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
you for your question it is my intent
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
that it apply to all vaccinations
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson and thank you
 
04:13:44.950 --> 04:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i want to put a scenario and make
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure i've got this right so a person who
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
presents say at an emergency room and is
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
admitted to the emergency room
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
has presented with some very specific um
 
04:14:04.309 --> 04:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
possible issues that require certain
 
04:14:04.319 --> 04:14:05.830 align:start position:0%
possible issues that require certain
protocols

04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
and as soon as it's found out that that
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
person did not
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated that all those protocols
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
were then
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
pushed aside
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
would i not i wouldn't have
 
04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
in this i would
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the facility's fault
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
it was what happened after i was already
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
admitted well i must say hi but um
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think i'm sorry would i then
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
are we talking then we um someone would
 
04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
have to go to the board of
 
04:14:40.880 --> 04:14:42.229 align:start position:0%
have to go to the board of
medicine

04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
04:14:42.239 --> 04:14:43.110 align:start position:0%
medicine
for

04:14:43.110 --> 04:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
to report an issue
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
reporting to dhs
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how that would play out
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
um i would think that the
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
doctor wouldn't want to violate
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know the provider wouldn't want to
 
04:15:03.600 --> 04:15:04.710 align:start position:0%
you know the provider wouldn't want to
violate

04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
violate
 
04:15:04.720 --> 04:15:05.830 align:start position:0%
violate
the

04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:07.510 --> 04:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights that governs the
 
04:15:09.269 --> 04:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
facility that they work at
 
04:15:09.279 --> 04:15:10.710 align:start position:0%
facility that they work at
um

04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i think both would be
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know responsible in that situation
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
but i'm not i'm not sure the board of
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
medicine could probably weigh in um but
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
to speak to your scenario i actually
 
04:15:25.590 --> 04:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
knew um
 
04:15:27.269 --> 04:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
know somebody who was hospitalized in
 
04:15:29.349 --> 04:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
was had a ruptured appendix
 
04:15:31.680 --> 04:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
was had a ruptured appendix
and

04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
was admitted and
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
when they found out that
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
this person was unvaccinated
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
and also was refusing testing
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
they changed they completely changed
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
their course of treatment they were
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
going to do surgery and
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
instead they drained an abscess and put
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
them on iv antibiotics and said that
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
they were going to discharge them that
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
night so it does happen
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think they could have just treated him
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
as a presumed coveted positive and
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
didn't need to go all of that
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
to change the course of treatment but
 
04:16:09.750 --> 04:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
that brings up one of the issues and why
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
the bill is needed
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
i have a question um from the chair i
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't see any penalties in here is it
 
04:16:17.520 --> 04:16:18.790 align:start position:0%
don't see any penalties in here is it
assumed

04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
assumed
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
that if somebody's reported to the board
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
of medicine or facility to dhhs
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
licensing those two organizations would
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
take care of any penalties to be meted
 
04:16:29.439 --> 04:16:31.349 align:start position:0%
take care of any penalties to be meted
out

04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
i believe those are the two
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
bodies that would be dealing with this
 
04:16:35.279 --> 04:16:36.229 align:start position:0%
bodies that would be dealing with this
yes

04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay representative leon
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
as we're looking at this and looking at
 
04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement possibly through the board
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
of medicine are you aware that they
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
will issue confidential warnings prior
 
04:16:51.990 --> 04:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
to action that are not disclosed to
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
anyone and do you think it would be a
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
good idea if perhaps we're sending such
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
big ethical issues to the board that
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps redacted
 
04:17:02.469 --> 04:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
statements of these should be going to
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
healthcare hhs oversight committee just
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that they can review a basic redacted
 
04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
one to make sure that these things
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
aren't happening because if it's
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
confidential they're not able to discuss
 
04:17:12.720 --> 04:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
confidential they're not able to discuss
it

04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and um i'm
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
sorry if i haven't said thank you to you
 
04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
guys when you're asking all your
 
04:17:19.760 --> 04:17:20.790 align:start position:0%
guys when you're asking all your
questions

04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:17:20.800 --> 04:17:22.389 align:start position:0%
questions
um

04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that that would be a good
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
idea to add an additional layer of
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
oversight um
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
and kind of in that same vein where we
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
were just talking about uh penalty
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
this statute in general has had some
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
violations as we saw when we had the
 
04:17:41.710 --> 04:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
bill hb
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
1439 about
 
04:17:46.630 --> 04:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
ensuring that patients have visitors
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
some of that has been violated and
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
there are no teeth in this law so may be
 
04:17:54.950 --> 04:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes just a very
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
um every healthcare facility that i go
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
with every practitioner that i go to
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
today require me to wear a mask when i'm
 
04:18:16.149 --> 04:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
being seen
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
and i think if i were going and
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
to go and
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
if if the practitioner said i'm not
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
going to see you
 
04:18:27.349 --> 04:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
because you're not vaccinated but if
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
instead they said
 
04:18:30.149 --> 04:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to see you if you won't
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
wear a mask do you see e that is would
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
that be a legitimate reason to refuse to
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
see him versus saying i'm not going to
 
04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
see you if you have colgan
 
04:18:42.149 --> 04:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think a mask can be taken off
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
and you know can be worn temporarily a
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
vaccination can't you can't undo it so i
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:18:55.670 --> 04:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
so you would have no problem
 
04:18:58.710 --> 04:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
you're not saying that refusal
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh refusal to wear the mask while you're
 
04:19:03.510 --> 04:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
face to face with a practitioner
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
would not
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
be you would not have a problem with
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
that according to this bill correct this
 
04:19:10.790 --> 04:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't touch on masking at all
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
and thank you for
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
um taking this question i'm i'm still
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
after all this conversation i'm still
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
baffled if we're talking about
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
facilities or providers are we talking
 
04:19:27.120 --> 04:19:28.229 align:start position:0%
facilities or providers are we talking
about

04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:19:28.239 --> 04:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
about
outpatient

04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
outpatient
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
appointments within facilities or just
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
in residential
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
services but regardless
 
04:19:41.910 --> 04:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass would you um
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
would you see
 
04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
telehealth appointments
 
04:19:46.159 --> 04:19:47.189 align:start position:0%
telehealth appointments
when

04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
when um medically
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
um applicable
 
04:19:54.070 --> 04:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
as a an alternative to face-to-face
 
04:19:58.229 --> 04:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
is unvaccinated in other words if uh if
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
a health care provider said i'm not
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to see you in person but i will
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
see you in a telehealth appointment
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
would that um
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
04:20:12.870 --> 04:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
go along with the
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
spirit of this bill
 
04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative i i think it would
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
04:20:21.040 --> 04:20:21.910 align:start position:0%
like i said
um

04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
they can they can dictate different
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
policies to try to mitigate risk
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't doesn't say they
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
can't do that you just can't
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill the intent of
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
the bill is just so that you can't just
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
deny care outright
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's not really a follow-up but it's
 
04:20:46.710 --> 04:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
another question another question it
 
04:20:48.560 --> 04:20:48.570 align:start position:0%
seems like in my experience
 
04:20:48.570 --> 04:20:51.030 align:start position:0%
seems like in my experience

[Music]
the

04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
issue of denying care
 
04:20:59.110 --> 04:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
before someone starts in your care
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
as opposed to after you've been treating
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
somebody or somewhat different
 
04:21:04.040 --> 04:21:05.429 align:start position:0%
somebody or somewhat different

04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
i believe have a lot more leeway in
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
saying that they're not going to treat
 
04:21:10.399 --> 04:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
saying that they're not going to treat
someone

04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
who they haven't treated before as
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to their ethical
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
um responsibilities once they're already
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
in treatment with them
 
04:21:20.960 --> 04:21:22.389 align:start position:0%
in treatment with them
so

04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
would your bill apply to both situations
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
um if someone is first knocking on your
 
04:21:28.630 --> 04:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
door or
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
you've been treating them
 
04:21:31.240 --> 04:21:31.250 align:start position:0%
you know before
 
04:21:31.250 --> 04:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
you know before

04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
you knew about their vaccination status
 
04:21:37.590 --> 04:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
would it apply to both
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
i believe it would apply to both in
 
04:21:41.910 --> 04:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
these in this setting
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
so this setting is
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
um for admitted residents or patients of
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%

um

04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:59.269 --> 04:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure how to
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
ask this
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
but the subject of
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
whether this is really an issue right
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:06.469 align:start position:0%
whether this is really an issue right
now

04:22:06.469 --> 04:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:22:06.479 --> 04:22:07.269 align:start position:0%
now
uh

04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:07.279 --> 04:22:08.469 align:start position:0%
uh
yesterday

04:22:08.469 --> 04:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
driving here listening to the news i
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
found out that a woman that i know
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
i didn't know her name but she waited on
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
me at the post office for 30 years in
 
04:22:18.720 --> 04:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
me at the post office for 30 years in
salem

04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
salem
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
that she died
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
after the hospital
 
04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
in in a around boston
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
refused her
 
04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
monoclonal antibodies
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
so then they asked for old medication
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
they refused ivermectin
 
04:22:41.510 --> 04:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
they refused the best kind of respirator
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then they refused to transfer her to
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
a different hospital
 
04:22:47.189 --> 04:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
she died
 
04:22:47.199 --> 04:22:48.229 align:start position:0%
she died
so

04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:48.239 --> 04:22:49.269 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
asking have you heard anything
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
worse than that
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
i have not heard anything worse than
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
that and my
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
second question is
 
04:22:58.880 --> 04:22:59.750 align:start position:0%
second question is
if

04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:22:59.760 --> 04:23:00.710 align:start position:0%
if
oh

04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:23:02.630 --> 04:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
since this seems to be
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
from the help of everybody who's
 
04:23:04.479 --> 04:23:06.070 align:start position:0%
from the help of everybody who's
commenting

04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
commenting
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
it seems like in line four
 
04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
would to because it's mentioning 151 21
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
on line three
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
to make it match 151 21
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
then would would it be better to say
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
instead of no health care provider
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
licensed or registered
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
may refuse to make it match we'd say no
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
health care facility
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then for the providers
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
amend it so that it adds the other
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate rsas that cover those others
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um to your
 
04:23:43.510 --> 04:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
second point
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
um amending it and adding the rsas that
 
04:23:48.710 --> 04:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
govern specific providers
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
would cover the providers
 
04:23:52.630 --> 04:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
but i think the issue with the language
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
here and the statute that it
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the patient bill of rights is that
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of that statute the
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
the rights are listed as the patient
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
shall so it would an amendment to change
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
it to the patient shall not be denied
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
care based on vaccination status would
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate amendment one more
 
04:24:13.760 --> 04:24:14.550 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate amendment one more
question

04:24:14.550 --> 04:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:24:15.670 --> 04:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
one more
 
04:24:15.680 --> 04:24:16.630 align:start position:0%
one more
okay

04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
we were seemingly
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
wondering about the teeth
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody's violating this and what
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
what could dhhs do
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the absolute
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
sharpest teeth be
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
if you're breaking the rules
 
04:24:36.830 --> 04:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
license i don't know that that would be
 
04:24:40.630 --> 04:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
the sharpest but it would be pretty
 
04:24:40.640 --> 04:24:43.030 align:start position:0%
the sharpest but it would be pretty
sharp

04:24:43.030 --> 04:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
04:24:45.279 --> 04:24:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
chairman

04:24:47.510 --> 04:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
view transferring care to another
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner either in that facility or
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
another one is denying care or would
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
that be another way for a particularly
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
vulnerable or concerned practitioner to
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
to maintain care for that patient but
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
not personally be involved
 
04:25:07.990 --> 04:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question no i wouldn't
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't view that as denying care i
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good option for
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
patients within a facility i mean
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
providers within a facility thank you
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
well i had a question but i have a
 
04:25:27.189 --> 04:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative leon's
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
question first and wouldn't rewording
 
04:25:34.710 --> 04:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
the statute to say the patient shall
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
solve some of that problem because the
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
patient has a right to care then but the
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
patient does not necessarily have a
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
right to be cared for by me
 
04:25:47.110 --> 04:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
if i have a problem but there is
 
04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
somebody else who is qualified to
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
deliver the care that the patient needs
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
who is going to
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
provide the care it it allows a great
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
deal more room for
 
04:25:59.199 --> 04:26:01.030 align:start position:0%
deal more room for
providers

04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
to also exercise their individual rights
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
is that true
 
04:26:07.110 --> 04:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree thank you for the
 
04:26:07.120 --> 04:26:08.070 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree thank you for the
question

04:26:08.070 --> 04:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
and follow up follow up um and i had one
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
other word
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
question is would you be willing to
 
04:26:15.920 --> 04:26:17.830 align:start position:0%
question is would you be willing to
consider

04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:26:17.840 --> 04:26:19.189 align:start position:0%
consider
uh

04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:21.269 --> 04:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time remembering how
 
04:26:23.110 --> 04:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
to phrase it because we're changing the
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
phrasing but
 
04:26:24.399 --> 04:26:25.910 align:start position:0%
phrasing but
um

04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh it would be
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
no patience shall be denied and would
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
you object to adding the word solely on
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
the basis of vaccination status because
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about the cases
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
where there are three
 
04:26:42.000 --> 04:26:42.790 align:start position:0%
where there are three
other

04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
reasons that we
 
04:26:48.309 --> 04:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
deem valid i mean and then
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
having a patient say oh no i have to be
 
04:26:54.630 --> 04:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
treated because of the other
 
04:26:56.550 --> 04:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you for the question
 
04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
i i would not object to inserting the
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
word solely and i actually thought about
 
04:27:04.870 --> 04:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
that too so thank you so that that would
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
help thank you
 
04:27:08.550 --> 04:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question uh would
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
you believe uh
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
relative to a
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
phrase we heard earlier about confident
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
about confidential uh warnings uh that
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
often confidential warnings are meant to
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
be confidential to allow the person in
 
04:27:29.189 --> 04:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
that case a provider physician involved
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
to respond and clarify and sometimes i
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
was involved in one such episode when i
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
was a practicing physician that there
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
was a miscommunication
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh that it was confidential it allowed
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
me a chance to respond and clarify
 
04:27:47.269 --> 04:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh so i just just i wanted that
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
are you aware that that confidential
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism is in place
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
i was not aware but i would believe it
 
04:27:53.840 --> 04:27:54.630 align:start position:0%
i was not aware but i would believe it
uh

04:27:54.630 --> 04:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you um
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
also uh i think it's uh relative to uh
 
04:28:03.670 --> 04:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
are you aware that oftentimes a
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
physician who may be in private practice
 
04:28:12.550 --> 04:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then a facility purchases their
 
04:28:12.560 --> 04:28:13.590 align:start position:0%
and then a facility purchases their
practice

04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that then will change
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
some of the parameters in which they can
 
04:28:21.670 --> 04:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
both economically as as well as actual
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
day-to-day uh procedures
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
so uh that can come into play and
 
04:28:29.110 --> 04:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
therefore the it
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
makes it cloudy between if it's just for
 
04:28:34.149 --> 04:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
the facility may be impacting his
 
04:28:39.110 --> 04:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
response but are you aware that that
 
04:28:41.429 --> 04:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
creates a little bit of a
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty i understand uh i think i
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand your question um so but this
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
particular chapter is
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
describes the rights and
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of each patient
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
admitted to a facility
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
except those admitted by a home health
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
care provider so these are for patients
 
04:29:02.950 --> 04:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
admitted to
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
the hospital or a nursing home um not
 
04:29:07.680 --> 04:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
the hospital or a nursing home um not
those

04:29:08.710 --> 04:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
who are
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know seeing a specialist in a clinic
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
inside of one of those hospitals
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
going to fall just to
 
04:29:19.110 --> 04:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we clarify because we're
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
talking provider being physician versus
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
facility and i think that has to be a
 
04:29:24.720 --> 04:29:26.229 align:start position:0%
facility and i think that has to be a
distinction

04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
04:29:28.149 --> 04:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
because of some of the economic
 
04:29:28.159 --> 04:29:29.189 align:start position:0%
because of some of the economic
uh

04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
relationships that some of these
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
providers versus facilities have and
 
04:29:35.910 --> 04:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
will impact what you're trying to do
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah um yeah i understand what
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying so
 
04:29:40.640 --> 04:29:41.510 align:start position:0%
you're saying so
uh

04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
i mean language to clarify i'm not
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
against but it seems like
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
there's some movement on
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
including providers also instead of just
 
04:29:50.820 --> 04:29:50.830 align:start position:0%
facilities so i guess
 
04:29:50.830 --> 04:29:53.590 align:start position:0%
facilities so i guess
[Music]

04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:29:59.349 --> 04:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
the chair calls uh catherine michelotti
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
who has filled out a pink card she comes
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
and wishes to speak in support of the
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill thank you so much for coming hi
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you rep chairman for accepting my
 
04:30:25.750 --> 04:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
ques or my testimony i guess and thank
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
you everyone for having us here
 
04:30:31.110 --> 04:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
um i would like to testify as a parent
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
who has been
 
04:30:35.110 --> 04:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
has had my child denied care for
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination status
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
prior to covid even
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
because a child one of my children had a
 
04:30:44.070 --> 04:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
reaction to a vaccine
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
as a young infant
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
and my doctor in another state had said
 
04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
please make sure this child does not get
 
04:30:52.149 --> 04:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
this vaccine again and despite that
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
record being transferred
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
to the state where we lived at the time
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
the provider would
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
refuse to care for my child and so we
 
04:31:03.670 --> 04:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
had to go on a physician search when my
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
son was dealing with lyme disease and
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
his lyme disease was unchecked for
 
04:31:07.920 --> 04:31:08.950 align:start position:0%
his lyme disease was unchecked for
months

04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
while i tried to find a physician who
 
04:31:13.189 --> 04:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
would see him because he had not had a
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
pneumococcal vaccine
 
04:31:18.309 --> 04:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
and so i would like to
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
put my support behind this bill because
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important for more
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
than just
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
current vaccines that are new
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you would you take any
 
04:31:31.269 --> 04:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the i'd be happy
 
04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman also thank you for
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
when that happened
 
04:31:45.830 --> 04:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
was there a complaint filed with the
 
04:31:47.349 --> 04:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
board of medicine or the board
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
overseeing that practitioner about the
 
04:31:51.429 --> 04:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
issue of violating what i consider to be
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
their ethics which the boards take
 
04:31:53.600 --> 04:31:54.870 align:start position:0%
their ethics which the boards take
seriously

04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be honest there wasn't
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
as a mom who was dealing with a very
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
sick kiddo i didn't even know that was
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
an option
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
i was just really concerned with finding
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
someone who would take care of my child
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i did not know that that was
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
something i could do and i have a
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
feeling i'm not the only one
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
who knows you know if i'm denied care oh
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's some there's steps i can take i
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.399 --> 04:32:22.630 align:start position:0%

i'm not quite sure there's a lot of
different

04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
takes on it
 
04:33:11.990 --> 04:33:12.000 align:start position:0%

04:33:16.240 --> 04:33:17.429 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to testify today and for
uh

04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
listening to me even though i probably
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.840 --> 04:33:30.551 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of when covid
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
vaccines were first released to the
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
general public the unvaccinated have
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
faced so much discrimination because of
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
not to inject potentially harmful
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
substances into their bodies
 
04:33:48.400 --> 04:33:49.910 align:start position:0%
substances into their bodies
and

04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
i personally personally believe that
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
denying someone healthcare because
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
of what they choose to do um
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
with their with their selves is
 
04:34:03.119 --> 04:34:04.390 align:start position:0%
with their with their selves is
completely

04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
completely
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
terrible i i don't think it should be
 
04:34:06.400 --> 04:34:07.830 align:start position:0%
terrible i i don't think it should be
legal

04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
legal
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
um furthermore i think it violates the
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
hippocratic oath which
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
all medical
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
service providers i think take and it
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
says that they will not do
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
any harm and denying someone care is
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:29.600 --> 04:34:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
speaking as someone who can't get the
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine um
 
04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
i have an anxiety diagnosis and to me
 
04:34:54.949 --> 04:34:54.959 align:start position:0%
and to my mother and to
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
whatever doctor would have to administer
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccine to me
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's not worth the panic attack it's not
 
04:35:01.119 --> 04:35:02.789 align:start position:0%
it's not worth the panic attack it's not
worth

04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
worth
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to cause i've also
 
04:35:08.470 --> 04:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
had a bad reaction to a vaccine before
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
and for me i really just can't risk it
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
and the fact that i could be denied
 
04:35:14.879 --> 04:35:16.310 align:start position:0%
and the fact that i could be denied
life-saving

04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
life-saving
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
health care because of it
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
just doesn't sit right with me
 
04:35:21.680 --> 04:35:22.551 align:start position:0%
just doesn't sit right with me
and

04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
i think i can say the same for my
 
04:35:29.670 --> 04:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
i guess that's it
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
would you take questions from everyone
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%

04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%

04:35:58.709 --> 04:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
and i hope you believe
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
that under no circumstances
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
would you be done any care that was even
 
04:36:06.000 --> 04:36:08.789 align:start position:0%
would you be done any care that was even
remotely

04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
04:36:08.799 --> 04:36:10.789 align:start position:0%
remotely
life-threatening

04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
life-threatening
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
we would never
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:16.400 --> 04:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand what you're
 
04:36:20.480 --> 04:36:23.189 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand what you're
asking

04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is a way we make speeches with it
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:32.551 --> 04:36:32.561 align:start position:0%
we just want you to know from the
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
medical community that we do care
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that that may not seem like it at
 
04:36:37.920 --> 04:36:38.949 align:start position:0%
and that that may not seem like it at
times

04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
times
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
and sometimes we as physicians
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
believe it or not physicians have been
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
known make the wrong decisions in some
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances and that weighs as heavily
 
04:36:51.429 --> 04:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
on us
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
as us
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
as it does you
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
trust me i've been there many times as a
 
04:36:59.429 --> 04:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
as a surgeon
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
and it's it's
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
we weigh on this very
 
04:37:02.799 --> 04:37:04.310 align:start position:0%
we weigh on this very
very

04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
and we carry it with us
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
day to day
 
04:37:07.760 --> 04:37:08.470 align:start position:0%
day to day
and

04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
night to night
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
when things don't go quite right
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate but just we want you to
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
know when i speak i'm sure for the whole
 
04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
medical community we do care
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%

that
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
a one-time second grade teacher
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
a one-time second grade teacher but i i
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
also have a would you believe question
 
04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
which is how we ask questions without
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
how we make statements without asking
 
04:37:42.000 --> 04:37:43.429 align:start position:0%
how we make statements without asking
questions

04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:37:43.439 --> 04:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
questions
but

04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
would you believe that your testimony
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
was really impressive
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
even without your age and even without
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
anxiety issues
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the fact that you were able to do it
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
what you did
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:04.869 align:start position:0%
what you did
is

04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:38:04.879 --> 04:38:05.830 align:start position:0%
is
really

04:38:05.830 --> 04:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
really great
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that at your age i
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
could no more have done what you just
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
did than i could have grown wings and
 
04:38:15.279 --> 04:38:16.551 align:start position:0%
did than i could have grown wings and
flown

04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
flown
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
so you are well on your way
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
to becoming an advocate for whatever you
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
want to advocate for in your life as you
 
04:38:27.429 --> 04:38:27.439 align:start position:0%

committee members um i'm not going to
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
tell you lots of stories because you've
 
04:40:07.830 --> 04:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
had folks have already heard a lot of
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
them from me
 
04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i will say is that
 
04:40:14.230 --> 04:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
i am vaccine injured i have a
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
granddaughter that that's vaccine
 
04:40:16.000 --> 04:40:17.190 align:start position:0%
granddaughter that that's vaccine
injured

04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
injured
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
from another state we had to have her
 
04:40:22.390 --> 04:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
come to new hampshire to get treatment
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
because she was denied treatment
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the other state and she is now being
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:32.400 --> 04:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to let you folks know that
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
i have filed complaints with the boards
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
the medical board
 
04:40:44.708 --> 04:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
one of the things is you don't know
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
they don't ever tell you what the
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
consequence or the the outcome of those
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
complaints are even as someone who files
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
a complaint um what i can tell you is 12
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
years after i filed my first complaint
 
04:41:01.030 --> 04:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
about a specific doctor he was
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
he did lose his license to practice but
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
that was 12 years after my first
 
04:41:07.110 --> 04:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
complaint and i really don't know how
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
many people it took to complain against
 
04:41:11.110 --> 04:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
him before he was
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
his license was pulled
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
so that's it i just wanted to put myself
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
out there so if any of you folks have
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
any questions um to want us to want to

story you told was that person did not
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
care because of their vaccination status
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
or because of the treatment they they
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
were requesting they were denied care
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
because of their vaccination status it
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%

michael padmore from the new hampshire
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.350 --> 04:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is mike padmore
 
04:42:19.110 --> 04:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of advocacy with the
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society
 
04:42:23.670 --> 04:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to speak in opposition to
 
04:42:23.680 --> 04:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
i'm here today to speak in opposition to
hb1003

04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
hb1003
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
not based on the intent of the bill and
 
04:42:30.070 --> 04:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
listening to the bill sponsor i think
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
that we all agree on a number of
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
different things but i think that
 
04:42:36.628 --> 04:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
our opposition more comes from uh we
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
feel that uh the intent of the the bill
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
is covered by uh the current statute um
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
a physician's responsibility to treat
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
patients without prejudice or
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination is a key component of the
 
04:42:50.788 --> 04:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
american medical association's
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
code of ethics which all physicians are
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
required to adhere by in statute through
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
administrative rule med10 excuse me
 
04:42:58.638 --> 04:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
administrative rule med10 excuse me
501.02

04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
501.02
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
which the new hampshire board of
 
04:43:04.868 --> 04:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
medicine is charged with enforcing
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
any patient who believes
 
04:43:08.708 --> 04:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
that a physician has violated this
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
and those ethical rules does have
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
recourse to file a complaint with board
 
04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
of medicine which we obviously have seen
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
some folks talk about that today
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
we agree patients should not be refused
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
care based solely on their vaccination
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
status but any decisions to refuse care
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
should be made through thorough and
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
thoughtful consideration of the medical
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
ethics to which physicians are held and
 
04:43:32.868 --> 04:43:32.878 align:start position:0%
for which mechanisms are in place uh for
 
04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
this review by the board of medicine
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
altogether again we appreciate the
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent of the bill we feel
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
that it's important to allow for our
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
state's health care providers to
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
continue to make these ethical decisions
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
based on the current statute of the law
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to answer any
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:56.390 --> 04:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question so and goodbye to our
 
04:44:01.040 --> 04:44:04.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question so and goodbye to our
guests

04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
if the current statute
 
04:44:09.190 --> 04:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
addresses the problem
 
04:44:10.948 --> 04:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
that that this
 
04:44:10.958 --> 04:44:12.390 align:start position:0%
that that this
uh

04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
bill or hb 1003 is is trying to to
 
04:44:16.240 --> 04:44:17.430 align:start position:0%
bill or hb 1003 is is trying to to
address

04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
then why have patients been denied
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
as we've heard today
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.510 --> 04:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
as we've also heard i mean
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know all of the details of all
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
these different cases and if they've
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
been brought to the board of medicine
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
and reviewed and investigated that is
 
04:44:40.150 --> 04:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
the current recourse um
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
04:44:50.320 --> 04:44:51.430 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
so

04:44:51.430 --> 04:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:54.390 --> 04:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
as the previous uh person who testified
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
stated she did complain to the board and
 
04:45:00.150 --> 04:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
it took 12 years for one position that
 
04:45:01.830 --> 04:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
she had complained against and there was
 
04:45:01.840 --> 04:45:03.990 align:start position:0%
she had complained against and there was
no

04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up to her as to to know whether
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
or not there was any recourse
 
04:45:11.030 --> 04:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
for what had happened
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and if she recently has got a problem
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
with having a family member refused to
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
what what is the recourse is the is
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
there no recourse
 
04:45:29.590 --> 04:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
as as i've stated the recourse would be
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
to go to the board of medicine i don't
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
speak for the board of medicine and
 
04:45:36.868 --> 04:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
their processes um individuals you know
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
are still allowed to go to to seek other
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
treatment providers um if one particular
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
treatment provider made a decision not
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
to treat that patient
 
04:45:46.788 --> 04:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
you know they are responsible for that
 
04:45:48.070 --> 04:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
decision and
 
04:45:49.830 --> 04:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
through that res that recourse of the
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
board of medicine individuals always are
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
available or always are allowed to go
 
04:45:55.990 --> 04:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
and seek treatment elsewhere
 
04:45:57.430 --> 04:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.520 --> 04:46:04.310 align:start position:0%
 
it's

04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
if i understand right you are saying
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
that a provider who does not who does
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
not treat you
 
04:46:14.470 --> 04:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
if they refuse you don't happen even if
 
04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
you report them you don't know
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
what what the result is
 
04:46:18.958 --> 04:46:19.750 align:start position:0%
what what the result is
and

04:46:19.750 --> 04:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
that sounds like you also don't get any
 
04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
help while you're being denied treatment
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
do you agree
 
04:46:28.958 --> 04:46:30.230 align:start position:0%
do you agree
that

04:46:30.230 --> 04:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
this proposed bill
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
is mentioning
 
04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
do you agree with the people who have
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
said this bill is actually by citing
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:46:41.590 align:start position:0%
said this bill is actually by citing
15121

04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
15121
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually should be referring to
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
facilities rather than providers
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
so in that case are you a representative
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
of facilities so can you explain how
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
this would affect facilities
 
04:46:59.590 --> 04:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
i i should have clarified when i when i
 
04:47:01.750 --> 04:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
began my testimony i realized that there
 
04:47:03.510 --> 04:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that this this bill does not
 
04:47:05.670 --> 04:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
specifically address the physician
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
statute um but
 
04:47:09.270 --> 04:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
because there was reference to
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers i did feel that it
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
was appropriate for at least to come and
 
04:47:12.638 --> 04:47:14.070 align:start position:0%
was appropriate for at least to come and
just

04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
speak to i think the physician's
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
perspective on this but i don't know if
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
i can answer your question specifically
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
because i don't speak necessarily for
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
the facilities
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leon thank you
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and thank you for coming to
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
answer questions on this today
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
my question is about oversight over the
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
complaints process at the board of
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
medicine is there any oversight on the
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
top-level basis about types of complaint
 
04:47:40.948 --> 04:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
or anything else that's provided to any
 
04:47:43.270 --> 04:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
legislative body or
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
to any of anything with anyone within
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature

04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson and all the
 
04:48:30.788 --> 04:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
members of the committee present today
 
04:48:32.948 --> 04:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
like others on the committee i was a
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
little surprised that this was put forth
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
for possible legislation
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
as a physician and other physicians have
 
04:48:43.350 --> 04:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
remarked is this is this a problem
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
i mean is this is this happening
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i felt like
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
posing the question to myself out loud
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is happening in new hampshire
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
not knowing the answer suspecting that
 
04:49:00.550 --> 04:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
it is and representative
 
04:49:00.560 --> 04:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
it is and representative
cushman

04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
04:49:03.430 --> 04:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
clearly gave
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that it is happening
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
now i must admit that i'm not a little
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
confused as to where this legislation
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
belongs uh in the main i believe that
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
patients need this
 
04:49:18.798 --> 04:49:20.070 align:start position:0%
patients need this
protection

04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
protection
 
04:49:23.830 --> 04:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
um it's it's sort of a proactive bill in
 
04:49:26.550 --> 04:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
a way in that patients really need
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
to know that they have the right to be
 
04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
treated and not refused
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
for medical treatment
 
04:49:34.320 --> 04:49:35.190 align:start position:0%
for medical treatment
um

04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
people have mentioned maybe this belongs
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
on the bill of rights uh patient rights
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh and and i
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
not knowing much about how laws are made
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
and enacted i would agree with that
 
04:49:51.270 --> 04:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
to to my limited knowledge of that
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
but the question of where it belongs
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
can be sorted out by people much smarter
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
than i am
 
04:50:01.510 --> 04:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i do strongly believe it belongs it
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
belongs somewhere because
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
as others have stated there's
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination going on
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
and i think it i need to clarify that it
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be written down somewhere that
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
the public can access this information
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
that this woman who gave brave testimony
 
04:50:25.270 --> 04:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
with her family that she
 
04:50:28.230 --> 04:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:28.240 --> 04:50:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
treatment

04:50:29.910 --> 04:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
but she wasn't aware that she was able
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
to bring that to the board of medicine
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
i think if so this were somewhere
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
in the public record that yes as a
 
04:50:38.798 --> 04:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
in the public record that yes as a
patient

04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:50:41.350 --> 04:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
this is your right
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that you have you have a right not
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
discriminated solely on your vaccination
 
04:50:46.878 --> 04:50:48.788 align:start position:0%
discriminated solely on your vaccination
status

04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
status
 
04:50:51.350 --> 04:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
and i would agree that yes this is
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.680 --> 04:51:00.948 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.470 --> 04:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
04:51:18.628 --> 04:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
in lieu of since you know we
 
04:51:21.270 --> 04:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
as a person on your side on this issue i
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate your coming and testifying
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
and so do you have any suggestions
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
because you know people really want to
 
04:51:32.070 --> 04:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
make other people safe as well as
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
themselves so do you have any
 
04:51:34.320 --> 04:51:36.070 align:start position:0%
themselves so do you have any
recommendations

04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
that that ought to be part of public
 
04:51:40.830 --> 04:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
health to try to be an
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
alternative to this
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
not so great way of protecting with
 
04:51:46.718 --> 04:51:50.470 align:start position:0%
not so great way of protecting with
vaccines

04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:51:53.830 --> 04:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
what i would throw
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
forth as someone who's not vaccinated is
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
please lose your unfounded fear of
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
people who are unvaccinated
 
04:52:05.430 --> 04:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
we're not full of germs we don't have
 
04:52:05.440 --> 04:52:06.470 align:start position:0%
we're not full of germs we don't have
any

04:52:06.470 --> 04:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:52:09.030 --> 04:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
special evil superpowers to infect
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
others it is clearly known
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the vaccinated and the unvaccinated
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
are equally
 
04:52:20.788 --> 04:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
able to transmit the disease
 
04:52:20.798 --> 04:52:21.910 align:start position:0%
able to transmit the disease
perhaps

04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:52:23.830 --> 04:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
if you're vaccinated and you have the
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
gather and travel and and meet with a
 
04:52:32.788 --> 04:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
04:52:34.628 --> 04:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
because i've been vaccinated well that's
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
not practicing safe distancing but
 
04:52:40.390 --> 04:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm getting off topic here but um i i
 
04:52:40.400 --> 04:52:41.670 align:start position:0%
i'm getting off topic here but um i i
think

04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
i would i would recommend that people
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
lose the unfounded fear of the
 
04:52:51.670 --> 04:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated as someone who
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
might be someone to fear i mean we're
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
just regular people i mean there's no
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
difference between me and anyone in the
 
04:52:58.160 --> 04:52:59.110 align:start position:0%
difference between me and anyone in the
room

04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
as far as risk of spreading disease
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
depending on what your habits are
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:53:12.798 --> 04:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:53:13.750 --> 04:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
do you do you think that these uh
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
statute this should also be in the
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
statutes that regulate the providers
 
04:53:22.470 --> 04:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
such as
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners practitioners
 
04:53:25.200 --> 04:53:26.628 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners practitioners
physicians

04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
04:53:32.390 --> 04:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
dentists psa pa p a s's etc
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think it should include all health
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
providers yes
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and um
 
04:53:40.948 --> 04:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
there was a question before that comment
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
on like telehealth could that be could
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
that be an accommodation for
 
04:53:46.340 --> 04:53:46.350 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
04:53:46.350 --> 04:53:47.910 align:start position:0%
a way to
[Music]

04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
a telehealth could accommodate someone
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
so that you wouldn't have to refuse
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
treating a patient so that would be an
 
04:53:57.920 --> 04:53:59.110 align:start position:0%
treating a patient so that would be an
acceptable

04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation for sure
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor
 
04:54:06.550 --> 04:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
do i see
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'll take a
 
04:54:15.190 --> 04:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
stab at this question um
 
04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
because i think i'm as confused as you
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
are um
 
04:54:18.878 --> 04:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
are um
the

04:54:20.550 --> 04:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there's two problems and
 
04:54:25.510 --> 04:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and the bill addresses one of them
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
but there's still another problem
 
04:54:28.320 --> 04:54:30.628 align:start position:0%
but there's still another problem
um

04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:32.948 --> 04:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
so people are being
 
04:54:34.390 --> 04:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
from the testimony i've heard this
 
04:54:34.400 --> 04:54:36.550 align:start position:0%
from the testimony i've heard this
afternoon

afternoon
 
04:54:37.830 --> 04:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds like people are being
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
discriminated for not having vaccines
 
04:54:41.280 --> 04:54:42.628 align:start position:0%
discriminated for not having vaccines
and

04:54:42.628 --> 04:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:54:45.190 --> 04:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
people that have actually known about
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
how to
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
file those complaints
 
04:54:53.830 --> 04:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
either don't know what the outcome is or
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
nothing comes of it
 
04:54:57.270 --> 04:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
or both
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
is is that where your confusion is as
 
04:55:00.240 --> 04:55:02.310 align:start position:0%
is is that where your confusion is as
well

04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:55:02.320 --> 04:55:03.910 align:start position:0%
well

uh
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%

in new hampshire or any other board of
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
medicine i'm not fully aware of the
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
practice that they that they do in
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
evaluating complaints against physicians
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
or health care providers so
 
04:55:18.320 --> 04:55:19.270 align:start position:0%
or health care providers so
um

04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
i guess to answer your question i am
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
confused because um i do not know it is
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no further questions
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:58.628 --> 04:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:56:03.190 --> 04:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
the committee from record paula minihan
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
senior vice president state government
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
relations for the new hampshire hospital
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
association representing all our
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals the new hampshire hospital
 
04:56:11.830 --> 04:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
association is in strong opposition to
 
04:56:15.110 --> 04:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1003. this bill prohibits
 
04:56:17.030 --> 04:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers from refusing to
 
04:56:19.990 --> 04:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
care provide care or services based on
 
04:56:22.550 --> 04:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
patient vaccination status this bill in
 
04:56:25.190 --> 04:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
our opinion is simply not necessary let
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
me be very clear and direct hospitals do
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
not refuse services or care to anyone
 
04:56:33.750 --> 04:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
period in addition from a technical
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
perspective the statute being amended is
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
confusing rsa 151 21b is actually the
 
04:56:42.628 --> 04:56:42.638 align:start position:0%
home care client bill of rights which is
 
04:56:45.270 --> 04:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
not specific to health facilities per se
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
it also has nothing to do with
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
individual providers it is unclear what
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
what the sponsor of the bill was
 
04:56:52.550 --> 04:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
intending by the term health care
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
provider licensed or registered
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
as it is that is also confusing to us
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
concerning health care clinicians new
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire registers med techs only so it
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
is not clear why this term is being used
 
04:57:09.030 --> 04:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire licensed clinicians that
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
provide direct care to patients rsa 151
 
04:57:14.390 --> 04:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
as was discussed last week when another
 
04:57:14.400 --> 04:57:15.750 align:start position:0%
as was discussed last week when another
bill

04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1044 sponsored by
 
04:57:19.750 --> 04:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative mclean was heard is
 
04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
related to health facilities only no
 
04:57:24.150 --> 04:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
individual provider falls under this
 
04:57:24.160 --> 04:57:25.350 align:start position:0%
individual provider falls under this
statute

04:57:25.350 --> 04:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
and all the examples that i wrote down
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor we're talking about
 
04:57:31.270 --> 04:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
individual providers pediatricians
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
dermatologists etc
 
04:57:33.920 --> 04:57:35.750 align:start position:0%
dermatologists etc
i

04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
i also would like to emphasize that
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals treat all patients regardless
 
04:57:42.070 --> 04:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
of their ability to pay and certainly
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
they are agnostic when it comes to
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination status the current
 
04:57:48.550 --> 04:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
hospitalization data bears this out with
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
nearly 35 percent of those in the
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
hospital as we sit here today with covin
 
04:57:56.550 --> 04:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
19 are not vaccinated i would argue that
 
04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
this fact clearly demonstrates that this
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill is misplaced and unnecessary
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
further the emergency medical treatment
 
04:58:07.030 --> 04:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
and labor act it's a national federal
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
rule law amtala requires hospitals with
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
emergency departments to provide a
 
04:58:14.310 --> 04:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
medical screening examination to any
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
individual who comes to the emergency
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
department and requests such an
 
04:58:20.230 --> 04:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
examination and prohibits hospitals with
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
emergency departments from refusing to
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
examine or treat regardless of their
 
04:58:25.990 --> 04:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
ability to pay
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our hospital our health
 
04:58:30.628 --> 04:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
care heroes who have been tirelessly and
 
04:58:32.550 --> 04:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
compassionately caring for patients with
 
04:58:35.110 --> 04:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
covet for the last two years i ask you
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
to reject this unnecessary bill and
 
04:58:39.750 --> 04:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
honestly i find this offensive to our
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
health care heroes
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%

here i'm very grateful to hear that the
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
hospital policy is that you are not
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
discriminated for your uh vaccination
 
04:59:15.030 --> 04:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
status however
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is supposed to cover
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
many kinds of facilities
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
do you speak for them too no i
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%

it's not related to representative gay's
 
04:59:32.788 --> 04:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
question i just wanted to make one more
 
04:59:34.628 --> 04:59:34.638 align:start position:0%
statement but i i want to take questions
 
04:59:36.070 --> 04:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
first sorry
 
04:59:38.550 --> 04:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative king
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:59:42.958 --> 04:59:44.470 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:46.948 --> 04:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
i'm often reminded about uh why law
 
04:59:48.550 --> 04:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
exists in the first place and it's
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
usually because of the misbehaviors so
 
04:59:53.910 --> 04:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the healthcare heroes and
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.030 --> 05:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's a lot of them out there
 
05:00:02.230 --> 05:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
what do we do about the ones that are
 
05:00:04.310 --> 05:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
misbehaving as we heard from testimony
 
05:00:06.708 --> 05:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
today there are people that are being
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
denied health care whether it's
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
at a
 
05:00:13.910 --> 05:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
local provider or wherever it is but
 
05:00:16.150 --> 05:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
and we've also heard that
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
the k the the method of them bringing
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
that to the light is
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
not really being
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
handled very well
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
what is what are your what's your take
 
05:00:28.708 --> 05:00:28.718 align:start position:0%
on that thank you for the question so
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
again this bill as has been stated by
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
many um
 
05:00:36.628 --> 05:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
very experienced um legislators on this
 
05:00:40.230 --> 05:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee um this is amending rsa 151
 
05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
and again i don't think it
 
05:00:43.670 --> 05:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's not the patient bill of rights is
 
05:00:47.670 --> 05:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
151 21. um and what i wanted to say is
 
05:00:49.590 --> 05:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
that a statement was made that the
 
05:00:51.350 --> 05:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals are currently violating the
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights and i take
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
offense to that as well they are not um
 
05:00:55.920 --> 05:00:56.788 align:start position:0%
offense to that as well they are not um
a

05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:00:56.798 --> 05:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
a
a

05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
individual that is a child always has a
 
05:01:00.000 --> 05:01:01.190 align:start position:0%
individual that is a child always has a
patient

05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:01:03.670 --> 05:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me a caregiver or a parent that's
 
05:01:06.150 --> 05:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to come in if they are in the in
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
the hospital so the visitor policies are
 
05:01:08.638 --> 05:01:09.830 align:start position:0%
the hospital so the visitor policies are
staff

05:01:09.830 --> 05:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
staff
 
05:01:13.030 --> 05:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
but what you're referring to again
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
talking about pediatricians and and the
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
like though that falls under the board
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
of medicine or the appropriate cl
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
clinical board 151 is the licensing
 
05:01:25.830 --> 05:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
health facilities licensing board um and
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
there is um i mean i think
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative gay said the um the
 
05:01:33.270 --> 05:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
recourse is the department of hhs if a
 
05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
fa violation is
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
is filed with the department um the
 
05:01:39.830 --> 05:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
hospital could um they could their
 
05:01:41.590 --> 05:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
license is in jeopardy that's really
 
05:01:44.070 --> 05:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately um what this
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
what 151 is all about
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
so i think this is really an oplc office
 
05:01:52.230 --> 05:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
professional licensing and certification
 
05:01:52.240 --> 05:01:53.350 align:start position:0%
professional licensing and certification
question

05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
and if that's the intent that is
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
different and again i
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
as mr padmore said i also do not
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
represent the the boards um so i think
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's a question for the boards
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i think i said what i wanted to
 
05:02:14.400 --> 05:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
oh yeah i think i said what i wanted to
yeah

05:02:15.910 --> 05:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:02:17.590 --> 05:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
did you speak to the point you didn't
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak to when you said you were think i
 
05:02:22.390 --> 05:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
later did i think i did the other point
 
05:02:25.510 --> 05:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
the other note i wrote um is that um
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
relative to um
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
determination of um
 
05:02:32.948 --> 05:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
of how i mean this is well beyond my
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
scope by but representative knurk raised
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
this i think relative to um
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
organ transplants et cetera they have
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
ethical committees and i suspect both of
 
05:02:43.680 --> 05:02:44.708 align:start position:0%
ethical committees and i suspect both of
these

05:02:44.708 --> 05:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:02:44.718 --> 05:02:45.830 align:start position:0%
these
wonderful

05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
retired physicians sat on those at one
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
point there are ethical there are ethics
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
committees that um make those
 
05:02:54.948 --> 05:02:54.958 align:start position:0%
determinations relative to organs um
 
05:02:54.958 --> 05:02:56.070 align:start position:0%
determinations relative to organs um
etc

05:02:56.070 --> 05:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
etc
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
when when a um where you end up on that
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
transplant list so um i just um that is
 
05:03:04.868 --> 05:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
really um referencing when you started
 
05:03:06.550 --> 05:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
talking about that i was i just made a
 
05:03:09.030 --> 05:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
note about the ethics committees that
 
05:03:09.040 --> 05:03:10.868 align:start position:0%
note about the ethics committees that
hospitals

05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
engage in those decisions those
 
05:03:13.040 --> 05:03:14.150 align:start position:0%
engage in those decisions those
discussions

05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much yeah welcome thank you
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
and the chair now recognizes kelly
 
05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
potenza from rochester new hampshire who
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak
 
05:03:32.550 --> 05:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
so i drove here today because i didn't
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
know how many people were going to speak
 
05:03:38.788 --> 05:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
in support of this and i have been
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly for
 
05:03:41.040 --> 05:03:41.910 align:start position:0%
working tirelessly for
months

05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
months
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
as in a sense of
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
a kind of a patient advocate in a i've
 
05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
been working with southern new hampshire
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
medical i've been working with cottage
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
hospital um on behalf of patients that
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
in a sense are getting discriminated
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
against so
 
05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
in all due respect the reason why we
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
have to do things sometimes is because
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes there's tons of heroes out there but
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
there are people that are breaking it
 
05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
where is the recourse currently so if if
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
we make a
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know a complaint where does that go
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if that complaint doesn't
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
go anywhere and it doesn't have
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
money tied to it nothing's going to
 
05:04:19.120 --> 05:04:20.150 align:start position:0%
money tied to it nothing's going to
change

05:04:20.150 --> 05:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:04:23.270 --> 05:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so even this legislation
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
what happens what happens if somebody's
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
refused i can give you four dentists
 
05:04:30.830 --> 05:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
right now i can give you four
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
pediatricians out on the seacoast that
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
are denying um parents to have they
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
don't want their kids because they're
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated and so this is way more
 
05:04:41.990 --> 05:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
than cobot 19. this has been going on in
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for quite some time it's
 
05:04:47.590 --> 05:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
basically like we don't want you so this
 
05:04:49.590 --> 05:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
is the whole beauty of of medical
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
freedom right you have the choice to
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
take a vaccine and by the way cover 19
 
05:04:55.750 --> 05:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
is not a vaccine
 
05:04:58.390 --> 05:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
it is let's just be crystal clear about
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
that okay it is an experimental um gene
 
05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
therapy injection
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that is not fda approved it's only been
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
approved for emergency authorized use
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
and the only reason why this has had to
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
come up is because of the coven 19
 
05:05:13.760 --> 05:05:14.948 align:start position:0%
come up is because of the coven 19
injection

05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
injection
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
right now i i don't know if you guys
 
05:05:18.150 --> 05:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
realize this but
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
the veterans hospitals here in the state
 
05:05:23.670 --> 05:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire are not you you cannot
 
05:05:25.670 --> 05:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
get help if i can give you names if you
 
05:05:27.670 --> 05:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
want them i'll send it out to if these
 
05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
people are okay with it because we're
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
trying to find them other practitioners
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
that will treat them because if they
 
05:05:34.390 --> 05:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 injection they're not
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
allowed to get any treatment from the va
 
05:05:39.910 --> 05:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals right now in new hampshire
 
05:05:42.310 --> 05:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's going on and so let's talk about
 
05:05:43.990 --> 05:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
what southern new hampshire medical is
 
05:05:46.788 --> 05:05:46.798 align:start position:0%
doing or how about dartmouth-hitchcock
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
these hospitals all have systems they're
 
05:05:51.670 --> 05:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
called epic and serna and all of that so
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
when you are let's say you're in a
 
05:05:56.310 --> 05:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
life-threatening situation and you go to
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
05:05:59.030 --> 05:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask all of this
 
05:06:00.390 --> 05:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
information about you so let's say
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
that's me
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask you know all of
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
these you know personal information
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
the sixth line on a medical record right
 
05:06:07.760 --> 05:06:08.628 align:start position:0%
the sixth line on a medical record right
now

05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
for um southern new hampshire medical in
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
nashua is
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
covet you know basically it says covet
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
19 vaccination or they'll say it says
 
05:06:21.510 --> 05:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
patient is not vaccinated for cover 19.
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
how does that have anything to do with
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
anything are they asking about mmr are
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
they asking about flu are they asking
 
05:06:30.230 --> 05:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
about anything else which those are
 
05:06:32.230 --> 05:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have gone through this
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
rigorous testing years and years they're
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
not so why would that be on somebody's
 
05:06:39.990 --> 05:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
medical record that right there is
 
05:06:42.788 --> 05:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination i can tell you right now
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
my girlfriend's father was killed at
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire medical because
 
05:06:47.520 --> 05:06:48.310 align:start position:0%
southern new hampshire medical because
he

05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
he
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
was not vaccinated he went in there to
 
05:06:53.350 --> 05:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
get oxygen and they literally left him
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
there to die for one week they didn't
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
feed him they didn't give him iv fluids
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
he was like yeah did they treat him
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
he was there he was admitted but they
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
didn't give him any treatment this is
 
05:07:07.270 --> 05:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
going on in new hampshire unfortunately
 
05:07:09.430 --> 05:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
um it shouldn't have to be necessary
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
right they're right it shouldn't have to
 
05:07:14.390 --> 05:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
be necessary but we actually live in a
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
world right now when something is so
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
polarized and out of control that we
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
actually have to have legislation like
 
05:07:22.948 --> 05:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
this we have to pass laws like this but
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
it needs to have teeth because if
 
05:07:27.030 --> 05:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's denied any of this
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
they need to they need to lose a license

and it was determined that i probably
 
05:13:18.948 --> 05:13:18.958 align:start position:0%
had a concussion
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
um as soon as the nurse found out i was
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated and i told her it was a
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
decision by my doctor
 
05:13:30.868 --> 05:13:30.878 align:start position:0%

05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
15 minutes
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%

05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
by myself
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%

got my coat and put it on
 
05:13:48.628 --> 05:13:48.638 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is peter teroshan
 
05:18:54.868 --> 05:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
i'm one of the state reps that
 
05:18:57.270 --> 05:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
represents rockingham county district 14
 
05:18:58.830 --> 05:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
which is the town of atkinson and
 
05:19:02.550 --> 05:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
plaistow i'm here today to testify on

behalf of house bill 1099 as the prime
 
05:19:05.440 --> 05:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
behalf of house bill 1099 as the prime
sponsor

05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
1099 is an act prohibiting the
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:19:13.110 --> 05:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
from requiring vaccine passports for
 
05:19:16.230 --> 05:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
service services
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's designed to prevent discrimination
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
based on one's immunization status
 
05:19:27.510 --> 05:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine status in my opinion is a
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
private medical it's private medical
 
05:19:32.070 --> 05:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
information it should stay that way
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
lastly the department of health and
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
human services attempted to have public
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
hearings regarding the possibility of
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
establishing a passport mandate
 
05:19:43.510 --> 05:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation if enacted in house
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
bill 1099 should prevent such a mandate
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
from be
 
05:20:00.070 --> 05:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
again this is a very simple bill
 
05:20:02.160 --> 05:20:04.230 align:start position:0%
again this is a very simple bill
and

05:20:04.230 --> 05:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
it is designed to ensure that every
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
person has the natural essential
 
05:20:12.390 --> 05:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
inherent right to a bodily integrity
 
05:20:14.868 --> 05:20:14.878 align:start position:0%
free from any from any threat
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
or compulsion by government to accept
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
any immunization
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
accordingly no person may be
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
compelled to receive
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
an immunization
 
05:20:26.310 --> 05:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
for covert 19 in order to secure or
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%

05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
i ask that the committee fine house bill
 
05:20:48.390 --> 05:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
1099 autopass
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:20:51.190 --> 05:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
i will be glad to take any questions
 
05:20:53.030 --> 05:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have in regard to
 
05:20:54.548 --> 05:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:20:58.230 --> 05:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you very
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
much for taking my question
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
i just as a point of clarification
 
05:21:06.390 --> 05:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
because we have had a number of bills
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
that deal with the same subject matter
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that this bill is not in
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
any way in opposition to
 
05:21:14.400 --> 05:21:15.270 align:start position:0%
any way in opposition to
the

05:21:15.270 --> 05:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
department issuing vaccine cards or
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
documentation for those people who want
 
05:21:23.590 --> 05:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
them and need them
 
05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
no this bill doesn't does in no way
 
05:21:28.470 --> 05:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
speak to doing that but it does prevent
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
the department from requiring a
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory passport i just wanted to be
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
sure that they they would still be
 
05:21:35.280 --> 05:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
sure that they they would still be
available

05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:21:38.948 --> 05:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
yes yes this this would not affect that
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you thanks for the question
 
05:21:49.510 --> 05:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's on yet
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
oh more power to you
 
05:21:58.548 --> 05:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
better here i think i'm
 
05:21:59.910 --> 05:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think i'm dead
 
05:22:01.430 --> 05:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
oh there we go
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:22:04.868 --> 05:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
oh don't take it away representative
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
i apologize representative
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
in line 12
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
you specify
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
that an individual has been vaccinated
 
05:22:12.400 --> 05:22:13.350 align:start position:0%
that an individual has been vaccinated
against

05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:22:13.360 --> 05:22:15.830 align:start position:0%
against
covid

05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
covid
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
what would you like to do when the next
 
05:22:20.390 --> 05:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
epidemic comes around
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
are you going to pass another bill
 
05:22:25.750 --> 05:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
identifying that
 
05:22:27.910 --> 05:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
health to the threat of the community
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
and then another one and another one or
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
would you like perhaps to create a more
 
05:22:34.390 --> 05:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
general statement
 
05:22:37.670 --> 05:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
to uh push forward your intent that no
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
one should ever have to produce a
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
passport thank you
 
05:22:42.868 --> 05:22:42.878 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
question and when i did go to ols to
 
05:22:47.110 --> 05:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
draft it i
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
tried to intentionally keep it open to
 
05:22:51.510 --> 05:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
just covered and they added the 19 in
 
05:22:53.110 --> 05:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
there so if you want to do an amendment
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh amendment to strike that so that it
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
does cover any future variations that
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:09.750 --> 05:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually kind of
 
05:23:12.628 --> 05:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
go a little broader
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
05:23:15.990 --> 05:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
should it even say covert 19 should just
 
05:23:16.000 --> 05:23:16.788 align:start position:0%
should it even say covert 19 should just
say

05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
has been vaccinated
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
period we just spent a long time talking
 
05:23:22.948 --> 05:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
about a bill that had to do with you
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
know all vaccinations or just token 19
 
05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
and of course the names may be totally
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
different it may not be anything to do
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
with covet
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether it should be
 
05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
broadened to any vaccines i i kind of
 
05:23:35.670 --> 05:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
doubt that the department would ever
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
deny care anyway but i can appreciate
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
your antenna making sure it doesn't
 
05:23:42.948 --> 05:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
happen should have even broader
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't uh object to that
 
05:23:48.390 --> 05:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
again the intent is to protect all new
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens in their private
 
05:23:50.080 --> 05:23:51.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire citizens in their private
medical

05:23:51.430 --> 05:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:23:54.868 --> 05:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
information and to ensure that they're
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
we don't discriminate and create a class
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
those who are vaccinating those that
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
aren't and you know i can't predict
 
05:24:03.750 --> 05:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
what's around the corner but you know
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh mother nature the way she is
 
05:24:07.430 --> 05:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know there'll be something else down
 
05:24:08.948 --> 05:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
the road and it may or may not be a
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.548 --> 05:24:14.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:24:16.150 --> 05:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
the more broad we could make it and the
 
05:24:17.990 --> 05:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
more we can cover
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
any uh
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:30.868 --> 05:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:24:32.150 --> 05:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have a long history in this country
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
of having a separation with the federal
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
to the state level we don't want the
 
05:24:38.230 --> 05:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
federal government telling the states
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
what to do however this bill basically
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
tells us the cities and all the local
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities up with what they should
 
05:24:43.760 --> 05:24:44.548 align:start position:0%
municipalities up with what they should
do

05:24:44.548 --> 05:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
is that my reading this bill
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:24:49.830 --> 05:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative and and i would say no
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
what what this does say though is that
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
they can't again discriminate against
 
05:24:53.840 --> 05:24:54.628 align:start position:0%
they can't again discriminate against
you

05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:24:57.750 --> 05:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
um with what your status is so
 
05:24:59.190 --> 05:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
for example if the
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
local town or city wants to create a
 
05:25:01.680 --> 05:25:02.948 align:start position:0%
local town or city wants to create a
um

05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:04.230 --> 05:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know an ordinance that you have to
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
wear a mask
 
05:25:07.510 --> 05:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
in in town hall this wouldn't affect
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
that but it would
 
05:25:10.000 --> 05:25:11.510 align:start position:0%
that but it would
uh

05:25:11.510 --> 05:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:13.270 --> 05:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
prevent them from
 
05:25:15.750 --> 05:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
discriminating against an individual in
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
any services they may provide
 
05:25:19.750 --> 05:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
again on their their vaccination status
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.958 --> 05:25:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.040 --> 05:25:32.628 align:start position:0%
 
no

05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:25:35.350 --> 05:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
no okay uh representative leon
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative trojan for taking the
 
05:25:38.718 --> 05:25:39.910 align:start position:0%
representative trojan for taking the
question

05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:25:42.548 --> 05:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
am i right to read this that it's only
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
prohibiting discrimination or separation
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
based on an irreversible invasive
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
medical procedure as opposed to those
 
05:25:53.030 --> 05:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
easily reversible ones like masking or
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
other temporary measures
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:25:58.868 --> 05:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the title it it
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
involves vaccine passports so
 
05:26:03.990 --> 05:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:26:07.670 --> 05:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
masking passport so no that's not
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
included in here that's why i brought it
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
up in the case of a local
 
05:26:14.548 --> 05:26:14.558 align:start position:0%
governing board that wants to
 
05:26:17.190 --> 05:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
enact a mass mandate
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't prevent that
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up and follow-up is that then
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is preventing um this is basically
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
looking to that irreversible choice of
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
being vaccinated and if the science ends
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
up shifting then it then is this
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
intended so that people
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to take one even if maybe six
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
months or a year later they're no longer
 
05:26:34.798 --> 05:26:36.230 align:start position:0%
months or a year later they're no longer
important

05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
yes and as a matter of fact um
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know one of the
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
the points that i didn't make that i had
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
written down is that
 
05:26:46.868 --> 05:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
we're learning more and more about
 
05:26:48.868 --> 05:26:48.878 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:26:50.230 --> 05:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
the code with the new strains that are
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
coming out
 
05:26:53.750 --> 05:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
and we're compiling data in regard to
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
the transmission of covert in
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
relationship to whether you're
 
05:26:59.990 --> 05:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not and we're learning
 
05:27:01.670 --> 05:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
as we go forward particularly with the
 
05:27:04.548 --> 05:27:04.558 align:start position:0%
newest strains that
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
05:27:08.948 --> 05:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
numbers of people are transmitting
 
05:27:10.628 --> 05:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
the new strains whether they're
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated not doesn't seem to make much
 
05:27:12.480 --> 05:27:13.350 align:start position:0%
vaccinated not doesn't seem to make much
difference

05:27:13.350 --> 05:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
so you know i'm hopeful that the
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
the newer strains are
 
05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
are going to be um
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
less um
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
catastrophic to people they certainly
 
05:27:25.270 --> 05:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
seem to be but irregardless
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
i guess the point is that
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
i think as we look at
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
statistics and we look at them honestly
 
05:27:32.880 --> 05:27:32.890 align:start position:0%
we're finding that the
 
05:27:32.890 --> 05:27:35.350 align:start position:0%
we're finding that the
[Music]

05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:27:38.470 --> 05:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine passport of mandate
 
05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't what we thought it was going
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be in regard to
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
reducing the spread of the
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
disease disease so
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the intent is to
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
and reinforce people's constitutional
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
rights and their right to
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
medical privacy in regard to their
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
vaccination status thanks for the
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:03.270 --> 05:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representation
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
would it make any difference because
 
05:28:13.270 --> 05:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're using the term passport but we
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
also want to return which
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
many of us are opposed to passports but
 
05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want to stop
 
05:28:21.600 --> 05:28:22.868 align:start position:0%
we don't want to stop
producing

05:28:22.868 --> 05:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
producing
 
05:28:25.830 --> 05:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination for the people who
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
would you have any objection if
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
the wordsmithing somehow
 
05:28:35.360 --> 05:28:36.788 align:start position:0%
the wordsmithing somehow
uh

05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:36.798 --> 05:28:38.150 align:start position:0%
uh
used

05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:28:40.548 --> 05:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
you know maybe i i don't have an answer
 
05:28:42.868 --> 05:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
yet so i can't even make a proposal but
 
05:28:44.548 --> 05:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
something about like you defined
 
05:28:47.350 --> 05:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
passport in the ques in the statement
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
you define the passport as
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
proof uh but
 
05:28:53.590 --> 05:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
in this case that's what it means but in
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
other cases as
 
05:28:55.440 --> 05:28:56.788 align:start position:0%
other cases as
uh

05:28:56.788 --> 05:28:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
one other representative was asking how
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
do we retain the right to get a proof
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
but you use it in some cases as a
 
05:29:06.788 --> 05:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
passport i know i'm going all over the
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
place i'm not quite sure exactly how to
 
05:29:11.750 --> 05:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
address this but is that okay
 
05:29:11.760 --> 05:29:12.548 align:start position:0%
address this but is that okay
to

05:29:12.548 --> 05:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
to define words as long as the intent is
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the same
 
05:29:17.280 --> 05:29:18.310 align:start position:0%
exactly the same
well

05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
i i think the way that i have it written
 
05:29:22.708 --> 05:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
is it's pretty clear that in regard to
 
05:29:24.150 --> 05:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
not requiring
 
05:29:25.190 --> 05:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:29:26.708 --> 05:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
somebody to have to use the word
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
passport this other word you could use
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
to not basically intent on this is to
 
05:29:33.750 --> 05:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that we don't require
 
05:29:33.760 --> 05:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
ensure that we don't require
uh

05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
somebody be vaccinated to receive
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
services in the state nowhere in the in
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the language does it say that you can't
 
05:29:42.080 --> 05:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
the language does it say that you can't
uh

05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
provide um
 
05:29:48.310 --> 05:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know vaccination um
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
cards for people that choose to be
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
vaccinated indeed we're doing currently
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
05:29:56.708 --> 05:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
the language prohibiting that and but i
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
do believe that should be done on a
 
05:30:00.230 --> 05:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer basis so if you want to have
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
that done and that information available
 
05:30:03.270 --> 05:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
you will be able to if i don't want to
 
05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
have it
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
i would have the right under this not to
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
have it you know i'd want to be put on a
 
05:30:11.360 --> 05:30:12.548 align:start position:0%
have it you know i'd want to be put on a
registry

05:30:12.548 --> 05:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:30:14.070 --> 05:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
of people
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
where i'm segregated by again my vaccine
 
05:30:16.558 --> 05:30:18.150 align:start position:0%
where i'm segregated by again my vaccine
choices

05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
choices
 
05:30:20.070 --> 05:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
i hope i answered some of the questions
 
05:30:26.788 --> 05:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.190 --> 05:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe and would you believe
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
that i hope that representative gay
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
believes that
 
05:30:35.510 --> 05:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
i believe that this language still
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
permits me to get the documentation i
 
05:30:41.270 --> 05:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
want on a voluntary basis
 
05:30:45.030 --> 05:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
if i need it without any interference in
 
05:30:48.708 --> 05:30:48.718 align:start position:0%
that it is only the requirement broadly
 
05:30:50.948 --> 05:30:50.958 align:start position:0%
as an access to services that is
 
05:30:53.110 --> 05:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
prohibited here
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
i would believe
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
we do that here representative shapiro
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking this question
 
05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
um having read through the medical
 
05:31:11.510 --> 05:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
freedom and immunizations
 
05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
act i guess to be called it's already
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:25.350 --> 05:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
it will not prevent people from
 
05:31:28.390 --> 05:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
accessing department programs benefits
 
05:31:29.830 --> 05:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
or services
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
i assume that means department of health
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm just thinking about the intent of
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:31:38.480 --> 05:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
this bill
and

05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
what services
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
might the department keep people from
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
accessing are we talking about things
 
05:31:49.270 --> 05:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
like medicaid or tanf or
 
05:31:51.510 --> 05:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
what what services are you trying to
 
05:31:53.750 --> 05:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
prevent people from being discriminated
 
05:31:53.760 --> 05:31:55.670 align:start position:0%
prevent people from being discriminated
against

05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:31:56.708 --> 05:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:31:58.788 --> 05:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
question and um if you look at the bold
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
print it does refer to the department of
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
health and human services shall not
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
require a vaccine passport as a
 
05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
condition of eligibility for any uh
 
05:32:10.230 --> 05:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
for or access to department programs
 
05:32:11.990 --> 05:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
benefits or services in this section
 
05:32:14.070 --> 05:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports mean standard
 
05:32:16.150 --> 05:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
standardized documentation that an
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
individual has been vaccinated against
 
05:32:18.718 --> 05:32:20.230 align:start position:0%
individual has been vaccinated against
so

05:32:20.230 --> 05:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:22.230 --> 05:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's i think pretty broad but broad so
 
05:32:24.310 --> 05:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
that it includes any and all
 
05:32:26.948 --> 05:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
services that they provide so i'm not
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
specific to to just a handful because i
 
05:32:30.230 --> 05:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
keep that open for any and all services
 
05:32:32.240 --> 05:32:33.190 align:start position:0%
keep that open for any and all services
that

05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
may be
 
05:32:34.080 --> 05:32:38.628 align:start position:0%

05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and again for purposes of
 
05:32:47.840 --> 05:32:49.270 align:start position:0%
thank you and again for purposes of
clarity

05:32:49.270 --> 05:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering because the existing
 
05:32:55.350 --> 05:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
language already says
 
05:32:57.910 --> 05:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
no person may be compelled to receive an
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
immunization for coven 19 in order to
 
05:33:02.788 --> 05:33:02.798 align:start position:0%
secure receiver access any public
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
facility public benefit or any public
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
service from the state of new hampshire
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
or any of its political subdivisions
 
05:33:14.868 --> 05:33:14.878 align:start position:0%
does that not already cover all of the
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
services provided by the department of
 
05:33:17.280 --> 05:33:18.230 align:start position:0%
services provided by the department of
health

05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's part number one and part number
 
05:33:21.040 --> 05:33:22.470 align:start position:0%
that's part number one and part number
two

05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
is the issue
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
not the passport but the requirement of
 
05:33:29.430 --> 05:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccination itself
 
05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
which is what the first half of the bill
 
05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
speaks to
 
05:33:35.350 --> 05:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
aren't we
 
05:33:35.360 --> 05:33:36.788 align:start position:0%
aren't we
simply

05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
simply
 
05:33:36.798 --> 05:33:38.390 align:start position:0%
simply
stating

05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
stating
 
05:33:40.310 --> 05:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
the same thing in different terms and
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
confusing it by using two different
 
05:33:42.638 --> 05:33:44.230 align:start position:0%
confusing it by using two different
terminologies

05:33:44.230 --> 05:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
terminologies
 
05:33:46.470 --> 05:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
for the same concept which is my
 
05:33:48.310 --> 05:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is that your concept is
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
you don't want anybody
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
based on their vaccine their cova
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine choices
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
to be denied benefits well the statute
 
05:34:00.230 --> 05:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:03.510 --> 05:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
well it i believe it does to some extent
 
05:34:05.430 --> 05:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
but i want to
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
this legislation is intended to
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
make sure it includes the department of
 
05:34:11.430 --> 05:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
health and human services because let's
 
05:34:12.788 --> 05:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
face it they're
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
probably the biggest uh state
 
05:34:18.390 --> 05:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh government agencies
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
that has tremendous power to dictate if
 
05:34:22.830 --> 05:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
they so choose and to
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
make rule making so this wants to click
 
05:34:26.000 --> 05:34:26.868 align:start position:0%
make rule making so this wants to click
what

05:34:26.868 --> 05:34:26.878 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
the intent is is to
 
05:34:28.798 --> 05:34:29.990 align:start position:0%
the intent is is to
clarify

05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:34:30.000 --> 05:34:31.190 align:start position:0%
clarify
that

05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
the department
 
05:34:34.868 --> 05:34:34.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't require
 
05:34:34.878 --> 05:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't require
um

05:34:35.990 --> 05:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
you know a vaccine requirement
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
and um and i guess the reason why i
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that into language was
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
because the
 
05:34:45.590 --> 05:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
earlier last year they did
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
start having public hearings
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
with many people showing up concerned
 
05:34:53.830 --> 05:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
05:34:56.150 --> 05:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
interested in creating
 
05:34:59.270 --> 05:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
um a mandate so that this is to clarify
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
and to
 
05:35:03.510 --> 05:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
that happening in the future follow-up
 
05:35:08.948 --> 05:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
05:35:10.390 --> 05:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and again
 
05:35:12.390 --> 05:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
in in the interest of clarity and
 
05:35:12.400 --> 05:35:13.670 align:start position:0%
in in the interest of clarity and
simplicity

05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
simplicity
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
if i believed that
 
05:35:18.070 --> 05:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
such language was necessary which i
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
personally don't but if i believed it
 
05:35:20.320 --> 05:35:22.070 align:start position:0%
personally don't but if i believed it
did

05:35:22.070 --> 05:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
instead of introducing the concept of
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports into a statute that
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
was written about vaccinations
 
05:35:33.430 --> 05:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
would it not be more efficient and just
 
05:35:33.440 --> 05:35:35.430 align:start position:0%
would it not be more efficient and just
as

05:35:35.430 --> 05:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:35:35.440 --> 05:35:37.110 align:start position:0%
as
conclusive

05:35:37.110 --> 05:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
conclusive
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:45.430 --> 05:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
no person may be compelled to re
 
05:35:48.150 --> 05:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
to receive secu secure receiver access
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
any public facility any public benefit
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
or any public service
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire
 
05:35:54.638 --> 05:35:56.070 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire
or

05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:35:57.750 --> 05:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
services or any subdivision of
 
05:36:02.150 --> 05:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
05:36:04.150 --> 05:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
services probably needs to go to the end
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
of the line but
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
if you added dhhs into that list of
 
05:36:09.120 --> 05:36:10.548 align:start position:0%
if you added dhhs into that list of
people

05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
who this is not includes and is not
 
05:36:15.190 --> 05:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
limited to wouldn't that accomplish the
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
same thing without introducing
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
the apples and oranges problem into the
 
05:36:20.798 --> 05:36:22.788 align:start position:0%
the apples and oranges problem into the
statute

05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:36:23.670 --> 05:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative it may i'm not an
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
attorney i consulted with all us
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
obviously when we drafted this and made
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
it pretty clear what my my intent was
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the legislation um could it be done
 
05:36:37.590 --> 05:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
in a way perhaps
 
05:36:37.600 --> 05:36:39.350 align:start position:0%
in a way perhaps
um

05:36:39.350 --> 05:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:41.430 --> 05:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know that's something certainly
 
05:36:43.590 --> 05:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
you all as a committee can decide if you
 
05:36:45.270 --> 05:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
think the language is
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient if not i'm certainly open to
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment as long as it keeps the
 
05:36:52.150 --> 05:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
intent which i hope i've
 
05:36:55.270 --> 05:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
communicated what the intent is here and
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
if the committee agrees i hope you
 
05:37:00.548 --> 05:37:00.558 align:start position:0%
consider otp you know i certainly would
 
05:37:03.270 --> 05:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
be again open to amendments if you
 
05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
believe that would streamline and
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
be a little clearer i certainly would
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
i believe i saw representative
 
05:37:16.788 --> 05:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
merchant's hand yes
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
you did mr chairman but uh
 
05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
asked the question very eloquently thank
 
05:37:22.320 --> 05:37:28.230 align:start position:0%
asked the question very eloquently thank
you

05:37:28.230 --> 05:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:34.310 --> 05:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman wow
 
05:37:38.470 --> 05:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
the first time i heard the word
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
passport used in this context was to fly
 
05:37:43.510 --> 05:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
on an airplane
 
05:37:43.520 --> 05:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
on an airplane
and

05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:45.910 --> 05:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know later i guess there's been some
 
05:37:47.910 --> 05:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
conversation to get at a cruise ship or
 
05:37:49.590 --> 05:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that where it's going to
 
05:37:50.868 --> 05:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
leave the country and have to have a
 
05:37:50.878 --> 05:37:52.150 align:start position:0%
leave the country and have to have a
passport

05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
passport
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
now i haven't dug into this i haven't
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
exploded i don't know many facts about
 
05:37:58.390 --> 05:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
it but if i have a card that says i've
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
is that the same as having that passport
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
and can i get on an airplane and can i
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
do all the other things or does that
 
05:38:09.590 --> 05:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
then require some other step to be taken
 
05:38:11.350 --> 05:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
area and secondly
 
05:38:13.510 --> 05:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
does that mean only the department and
 
05:38:16.230 --> 05:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
state-run facilities and probably
 
05:38:18.948 --> 05:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
subcontractors from that state
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
but private businesses could require a
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
passport or at least certification
 
05:38:28.708 --> 05:38:28.718 align:start position:0%
of vaccination status under this law
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:31.430 --> 05:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative for the question and i
 
05:38:33.030 --> 05:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
think the reason we use the term
 
05:38:35.110 --> 05:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
passport is because that's been vented
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%

people's
 
05:40:53.750 --> 05:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
family members
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
and loved ones just because
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's one of the saddest things
 
05:41:04.628 --> 05:41:04.638 align:start position:0%
that i've seen
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
that people want to agree
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
people want to be in line seeing people
 
05:41:12.390 --> 05:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
falling dead in line
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
to receive something that you guys know
 
05:41:17.430 --> 05:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
very well has been killing
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
our family members and our children
 
05:41:24.548 --> 05:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
 
05:41:24.558 --> 05:41:30.150 align:start position:0%
i don't understand
how

05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
you have states like new york city
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
and california
 
05:41:37.750 --> 05:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
that are going to actually anyone who's
 
05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
ever been through
 
05:41:42.390 --> 05:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
any type of discrimination should not
 
05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
even think about
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
this bill i mean
 
05:41:48.150 --> 05:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
05:41:50.948 --> 05:41:50.958 align:start position:0%
allowing people to continue to inject
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
our family members for their death
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen it with famous people we've
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
seen it not with famous people we have
 
05:42:00.470 --> 05:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
people walking out all the time the cdc
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
themselves put it on their website that
 
05:42:04.548 --> 05:42:04.558 align:start position:0%
if you get the injection that your own
 
05:42:06.788 --> 05:42:06.798 align:start position:0%
immune system is 97
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
stronger than if you get the injection
 
05:42:12.070 --> 05:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
at 94 i think it lowers your
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
immune system as soon as you get it in
 
05:42:13.920 --> 05:42:15.190 align:start position:0%
immune system as soon as you get it in
there

05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
who wants to do that they said it
 
05:42:19.670 --> 05:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
themselves ted talk 2014
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
mr gates already talked about killing
 
05:42:24.070 --> 05:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
all of us but people want to sit around
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
and think that that's not true they want
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
to point fingers he said it himself it
 
05:42:30.310 --> 05:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
was out of his mouth at a ted talk
 
05:42:31.990 --> 05:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
and here we are how many years later
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what he said he was going to do
 
05:42:35.910 --> 05:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
on that ted talk is exactly before us
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
and then they cause it and then they're
 
05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
going to think that after causing people
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
to suffer and go through all these
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
things and then putting them out of work
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
because of something they created that
 
05:42:46.788 --> 05:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
you're not going to give them the help
 
05:42:49.990 --> 05:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
that they need that is not america
 
05:42:51.990 --> 05:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're not representing america at all
 
05:42:54.470 --> 05:42:54.480 align:start position:0%

05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
hospital association dhhs all these
 
05:45:44.958 --> 05:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
hospital association dhhs all these
different

05:45:45.990 --> 05:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
05:45:47.510 --> 05:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
levels of
 
05:45:50.708 --> 05:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
big corporation
 
05:45:53.510 --> 05:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
many of you may not even remember the ma
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
the ma bell controversy with monopolies
 
05:45:58.868 --> 05:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
but bottom line is that's what's
 
05:46:00.948 --> 05:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
happened with our health care system
 
05:46:02.230 --> 05:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
that's what's happened with the health
 
05:46:04.548 --> 05:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
care system and discrimination is
 
05:46:07.270 --> 05:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
happening it's happening more and more
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
often and yes do the unvaccinated need
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
to become a protected class or we need
 
05:46:15.750 --> 05:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of protection well once upon a
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
time we didn't need protection for
 
05:46:20.948 --> 05:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
sexual identity
 
05:46:23.030 --> 05:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't need protection
 
05:46:26.070 --> 05:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
against i remember
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
back then
 
05:46:35.110 --> 05:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
we needed protection so we got it why
 
05:46:37.350 --> 05:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
did we need protection because our
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
government and our media and our
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
corporate people had begin our
 
05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
corporations had begin to discriminate
 
05:46:48.548 --> 05:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
now is the time to stop the
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination all levels race
 
05:46:51.680 --> 05:46:52.868 align:start position:0%
discrimination all levels race
religion

05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
religion
 
05:46:55.510 --> 05:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh sexual orientation
 
05:46:58.310 --> 05:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination status unfortunately
 
05:47:01.270 --> 05:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination status knee is real
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
because it has been politicized we need
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:09.990 --> 05:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:19.590 --> 05:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
one question by betty gay thank you
 
05:47:22.470 --> 05:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and may i assume
 
05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
that not only you but the man before you
 
05:47:30.628 --> 05:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:47:33.990 --> 05:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative gay um
 
05:47:36.628 --> 05:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
i would like to be able to say
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we don't need this bill
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to be able to say we have
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
enough government already
 
05:47:43.440 --> 05:47:44.948 align:start position:0%
enough government already
unfortunately

05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:47:44.958 --> 05:47:46.230 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
when

05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:47:48.868 --> 05:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
government starts putting
 
05:47:48.878 --> 05:47:50.070 align:start position:0%
government starts putting
the

05:47:50.070 --> 05:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:47:54.310 --> 05:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:56.788 --> 05:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
ideas above
 
05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
the responsibility or the representation
 
05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the people then we need protection so
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes i truly support this bill but only
 
05:48:05.360 --> 05:48:06.788 align:start position:0%
yes i truly support this bill but only
because

05:48:06.788 --> 05:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's basically to stop
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
big government
 
05:48:13.990 --> 05:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
05:48:16.708 --> 05:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:48:36.310 --> 05:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i know i'm not supposed to be
 
05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
able to ask questions but i'm i'm pretty
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
sure that this um amend rsa 141 c1a
 
05:48:45.990 --> 05:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
has to do with the bill that was passed
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
last session which is hb 220 correct
 
05:48:49.200 --> 05:48:50.230 align:start position:0%
last session which is hb 220 correct
okay

05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:53.190 --> 05:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
i spent a lot of time on that hb 220. so
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the reason why we're
 
05:48:56.868 --> 05:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
here unfortunately
 
05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
hb 220 really didn't protect anybody you
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
know it was
 
05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time in a lot of
 
05:49:03.600 --> 05:49:05.110 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time in a lot of
testimony

05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
thousands of people were all about this
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to be protected
 
05:49:12.150 --> 05:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
so if you look at unh this is a great
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is a great example
 
05:49:17.430 --> 05:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
unh did absolutely the polar opposite of
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
this because then again hb 220 they were
 
05:49:23.350 --> 05:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
compelling vaccinations for their
 
05:49:26.070 --> 05:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
students denying religious exemptions
 
05:49:28.708 --> 05:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
and then also for all their faculty and
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
staff well based upon how this was
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
currently written without having this in
 
05:49:35.270 --> 05:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
here they should have been protected but
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
there was no teeth to it so then what do
 
05:49:39.030 --> 05:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
you have to do you have to go spend
 
05:49:40.948 --> 05:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to hire a lawyer
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
you have to pull your kids out of that
 
05:49:44.628 --> 05:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
school i mean it's crazy
 
05:49:46.548 --> 05:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
and it really shouldn't be just for
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
public because there's no real private
 
05:49:50.230 --> 05:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
business in the state
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
if that was the case then i could just
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
go open up my own little bagel shop
 
05:49:55.030 --> 05:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and then i wouldn't have to pay
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
anything to the to the state or anything
 
05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
like that it doesn't work like that but
 
05:50:00.628 --> 05:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
we're not going to go private and
 
05:50:03.030 --> 05:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
probably public because that's i know
 
05:50:06.070 --> 05:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
that that can't happen
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to adding this line in
 
05:50:10.948 --> 05:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh we have to add that in
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
and this is the reason why
 
05:50:16.788 --> 05:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
it has to do with vaccine registry right
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
so this goes back years we've been
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
wanting to build this for a long time in
 
05:50:23.590 --> 05:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we've taken in
 
05:50:25.110 --> 05:50:25.120 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
05:50:25.120 --> 05:50:25.990 align:start position:0%
federal money
once

05:50:25.990 --> 05:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
once
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
twice now we've probably taken in
 
05:50:29.510 --> 05:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
federal money three times millions and
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to build this
 
05:50:33.190 --> 05:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry that's actually never
 
05:50:35.910 --> 05:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
been built which is really creating uh
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
in a sense a um
 
05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
the haves and the have-nots it's
 
05:50:43.990 --> 05:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
creating uh an online
 
05:50:45.990 --> 05:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport system
 
05:50:46.000 --> 05:50:46.868 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport system
so

05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:48.390 --> 05:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
if we just look at our state
 
05:50:50.708 --> 05:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
constitution and our bill of rights
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
this is beautiful
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
article 2b right of privacy this right
 
05:50:57.030 --> 05:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
here protects us
 
05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
so if we strip away all of these laws
 
05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is what it comes down to an
 
05:51:03.670 --> 05:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
05:51:06.230 --> 05:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
05:51:08.788 --> 05:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
05:51:10.868 --> 05:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent
 
05:51:14.470 --> 05:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
wow that's all we need right there
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
and that should negate everything else
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
here but we have to continue to because
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're not really following the law of
 
05:51:25.590 --> 05:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
the land we have to continue to
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
put layers upon layers upon layers from
 
05:51:31.270 --> 05:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
hb 220 which becomes law that doesn't
 
05:51:33.430 --> 05:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
ever that doesn't really protect anybody
 
05:51:35.910 --> 05:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
and now we have to put this in because
 
05:51:35.920 --> 05:51:36.708 align:start position:0%
and now we have to put this in because
yes

05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
dhhs is an overreaching organization and
 
05:51:40.548 --> 05:51:40.558 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they're going to be coming up
 
05:51:42.868 --> 05:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
here to testify and oppose this and blah
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
blah blah but this is where we are so
 
05:51:50.230 --> 05:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
no one in any way shape or form should
 
05:51:52.948 --> 05:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
have to show anything to
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
go out to eat
 
05:51:57.350 --> 05:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually or go to a museum because you
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
know the is it the courier i think it is
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
in manchester that's now requiring a
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport isn't that wonderful
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
do they take state funds yes they do but
 
05:52:10.948 --> 05:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
they're still considered a private
 
05:52:13.830 --> 05:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
business let's strip away every single
 
05:52:16.230 --> 05:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
dime that they've received from state
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
funds grants and all of that okay
 
05:52:19.990 --> 05:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
because they're requiring that so this
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
is what is we've got to have bills
 
05:52:23.590 --> 05:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful but there has to be
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
teeth to it we have to hold these people
 
05:52:25.440 --> 05:52:26.708 align:start position:0%
teeth to it we have to hold these people
accountable

05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
05:52:26.718 --> 05:52:27.670 align:start position:0%

bill we're not going down either mechtum
 
05:52:55.270 --> 05:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
or any other thing that we will do again
 
05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we're not doing it today it's just
 
05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%

05:53:02.708 --> 05:53:02.718 align:start position:0%

05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
i find it odd that i'm sitting here
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
again i had went back took care of some
 
05:53:12.868 --> 05:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
patients in manchester came back
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
but specifically to testify again
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%

05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't you find
 
05:53:21.750 --> 05:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the aisle don't you
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
find it odd that we're sitting here
 
05:53:25.910 --> 05:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
discussing whether
 
05:53:27.430 --> 05:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're gonna discriminate against
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
somebody based upon their vaccine
 
05:53:33.750 --> 05:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh status
 
05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
whether they have a they'll have to
 
05:53:37.990 --> 05:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide a piece of paper that says that
 
05:53:38.000 --> 05:53:39.110 align:start position:0%
provide a piece of paper that says that
they

05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated or not in order to
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
receive what they're entitled to but
 
05:53:45.190 --> 05:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
05:53:46.868 --> 05:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
two years ago if you think back in your
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
mind two years ago
 
05:53:50.470 --> 05:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
or three years ago would you have ever
 
05:53:52.470 --> 05:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
thought that we would be
 
05:53:54.390 --> 05:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me we have a point of order yes
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative please speak to
 
05:54:20.548 --> 05:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
the bill directly
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:25.360 --> 05:54:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:54:27.670 --> 05:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:54:29.030 --> 05:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
is asking
 
05:54:30.310 --> 05:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
05:54:30.320 --> 05:54:31.750 align:start position:0%
that we don't
require

05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
require
 
05:54:33.910 --> 05:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
a vaccine passport
 
05:54:33.920 --> 05:54:34.628 align:start position:0%
a vaccine passport
or

05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
the proof of a vaccine in order to
 
05:54:36.638 --> 05:54:37.910 align:start position:0%
the proof of a vaccine in order to
receive

05:54:37.910 --> 05:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
receive
 
05:54:37.920 --> 05:54:39.350 align:start position:0%
receive
services

05:54:39.350 --> 05:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:54:41.590 --> 05:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
05:54:43.670 --> 05:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
and it's and what i was saying is it's a
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
shame that we have to even ask that to
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
even have to have a bill like this
 
05:54:50.310 --> 05:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
but we need to support a bill like this
 
05:54:52.230 --> 05:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
because if we don't
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
we'll go down the same
 
05:54:55.270 --> 05:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole
 
05:54:55.280 --> 05:54:56.548 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole
that

05:54:56.548 --> 05:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
required vaccines required mass and
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
other things
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
that we've seen over the last two years
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
will emerge and we'll say wow we didn't
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
think that was possible this will
 
05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
prevent that
 
05:55:10.708 --> 05:55:10.718 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm in support of it was
 
05:55:14.708 --> 05:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%

05:55:39.990 --> 05:55:40.000 align:start position:0%

being
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%

hamburger
 
05:56:51.910 --> 05:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have a vaccine
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
passport to get into burger king and
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%

05:57:04.548 --> 05:57:04.558 align:start position:0%
i also want that on the record because
 
05:57:07.270 --> 05:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
you don't trade your freedom for your
 
05:57:07.280 --> 05:57:08.390 align:start position:0%
you don't trade your freedom for your
safety

05:57:08.390 --> 05:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:57:11.590 --> 05:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
safety is a guide of tyranny
 
05:57:14.948 --> 05:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
and you don't cancel the constitution or
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
replace it with other
 
05:57:19.830 --> 05:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
laws that's not what our forefathers
 
05:57:22.868 --> 05:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
died for and gave their lives for
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
people fought and died for basic
 
05:57:27.510 --> 05:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
freedoms in this country
 
05:57:30.390 --> 05:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we're of a different generation it's
 
05:57:30.400 --> 05:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
and we're of a different generation it's
not

05:57:31.510 --> 05:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:57:34.070 --> 05:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know we didn't fight and die it was
 
05:57:36.390 --> 05:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
our grandfathers that did it
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
but they did it and they did it so that
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
we would have freedom now
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we need to have freedom we have to
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
have more freedom in this country
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
because it makes my heart sad to see
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
the changes in our country that i see
 
05:57:52.160 --> 05:57:54.628 align:start position:0%

happening

05:57:54.628 --> 05:57:54.638 align:start position:0%
happening
 
05:57:54.638 --> 05:57:55.510 align:start position:0%
happening

05:58:12.390 --> 05:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
health or physical health
 
05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%

05:58:48.230 --> 05:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
discriminated against for their health
 
05:58:50.868 --> 05:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
reasons or the color of their skin or
 
05:58:53.750 --> 05:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
their or whatever the reason is no one
 
05:58:56.070 --> 05:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
should be discriminated against and so i

good afternoon
 
06:00:53.430 --> 06:00:53.440 align:start position:0%

liaison for dphs and i'm here with ann
 
06:01:00.150 --> 06:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
marie mccurry bureau chief
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
section chief for immunization
 
06:01:04.708 --> 06:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
and we are here to provide information
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:11.030 --> 06:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman pearson and
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
currently rsa 141 c 1 a states that
 
06:01:19.350 --> 06:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
other than the exemptions that are
 
06:01:21.910 --> 06:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
specified under paragraph 2 and 3 no
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
person may be compelled to receive an
 
06:01:25.910 --> 06:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
immunization for coven 19 in order to
 
06:01:29.110 --> 06:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
secure receive or access any public
 
06:01:31.350 --> 06:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
facility any public benefit or any
 
06:01:32.868 --> 06:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
public service
 
06:01:34.708 --> 06:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
the addition of this language as
 
06:01:37.670 --> 06:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
proposed by hb 1099 is therefore
 
06:01:37.680 --> 06:01:39.270 align:start position:0%
proposed by hb 1099 is therefore
unnecessary

06:01:39.270 --> 06:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
as documentation and vaccination in any
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
form is not required by the department
 
06:01:46.310 --> 06:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
unless where code 19 vaccination
 
06:01:48.310 --> 06:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
requirements is authorized under
 
06:01:51.430 --> 06:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
paragraphs two and three
 
06:01:54.230 --> 06:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
where covet 19 vaccination is required a
 
06:01:56.310 --> 06:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
standardized documented vaccination is
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
necessary to serve as evidence of
 
06:01:58.000 --> 06:01:59.350 align:start position:0%
necessary to serve as evidence of
vaccination

06:01:59.350 --> 06:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
06:02:01.510 --> 06:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
currently covet 19 vaccination records
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
are issued by providers who administer
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination to the recipient or the
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
recipient's guardian at the time of
 
06:02:07.200 --> 06:02:09.750 align:start position:0%
recipient's guardian at the time of
vaccination

06:02:09.750 --> 06:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
06:02:13.750 --> 06:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
language of hb 1099 defines vaccine
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
passport to broadly include any
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
standardized documentation that an
 
06:02:20.070 --> 06:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
individual has been vaccinated against
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
coven 19
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
if hb 1099 were to pass then the
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
department's standard documentation for
 
06:02:27.750 --> 06:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination would be considered a
 
06:02:29.990 --> 06:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport
 
06:02:33.110 --> 06:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.070 --> 06:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add in that listening
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
to all the testimony today with the
 
06:02:40.548 --> 06:02:40.558 align:start position:0%
concerns of the sponsor and also
 
06:02:42.070 --> 06:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
um the really great point that
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber brought up about hb
 
06:02:46.470 --> 06:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
220 sort of already encompassing the
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
concerns of the what the department can
 
06:02:51.430 --> 06:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
offer um and does not does not offer a
 
06:02:53.110 --> 06:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine passport has no intention of
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
doing that that it would be
 
06:02:57.990 --> 06:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
if it was amenable to the sponsor maybe
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
the committee could consider
 
06:03:02.470 --> 06:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
adding in on line six after new
 
06:03:02.480 --> 06:03:03.750 align:start position:0%
adding in on line six after new
hampshire

06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the
 
06:03:07.350 --> 06:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:03:10.390 --> 06:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
and maybe considering
 
06:03:11.830 --> 06:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
not including the rest of the
 
06:03:11.840 --> 06:03:13.270 align:start position:0%
not including the rest of the
legislation

06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:03:14.868 --> 06:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
that would be something that we would
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
offer as something that would be
 
06:03:18.310 --> 06:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
amenable and
 
06:03:20.230 --> 06:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
helpful to the department and to clarify
 
06:03:22.230 --> 06:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
the legislation thank you thank you
 
06:03:27.190 --> 06:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:29.990 --> 06:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
if it were to read
 
06:03:32.230 --> 06:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
any public service from the state of new
 
06:03:32.240 --> 06:03:33.590 align:start position:0%
any public service from the state of new

06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%

or any political subdivision of the
 
06:03:40.390 --> 06:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
state in new hampshire and then
 
06:03:42.310 --> 06:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to all those
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
things that it's already including but
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
not limited to
 
06:03:48.390 --> 06:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
would that satisfy your concerns yes it
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
no further questions
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
one further question
 
06:04:00.150 --> 06:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative folsom with a further
 
06:04:00.160 --> 06:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
representative folsom with a further
question

06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:04:03.270 --> 06:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman pearson thank you for
 
06:04:04.708 --> 06:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:04:08.310 --> 06:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
um my question is for those people that
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
have an exemption for religious reasons
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
rights of conscious
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
medical reasons would they receive an
 
06:04:16.718 --> 06:04:18.310 align:start position:0%
medical reasons would they receive an
identical

06:04:18.310 --> 06:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
identical
 
06:04:18.320 --> 06:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
identical
card

06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
card
 
06:04:21.430 --> 06:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that if they went someplace they
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have to pull out something else
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
so everyone would see
 
06:04:27.510 --> 06:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
that oh you're one of them
 
06:04:27.520 --> 06:04:28.470 align:start position:0%
that oh you're one of them
so

06:04:28.470 --> 06:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
would they be able to receive the same
 
06:04:33.670 --> 06:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
identical card that everyone else gets
 
06:04:33.680 --> 06:04:35.510 align:start position:0%
identical card that everyone else gets
with

06:04:35.510 --> 06:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
saying no no no vaccine but
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
the department feels as though there are
 
06:04:49.270 --> 06:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
multiple systems in place to
 
06:04:51.430 --> 06:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
allow for those medical or religious
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions and those documents would be
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
a separate and distinct
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
card from any vaccination card because
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
those people would not be coming in for
 
06:05:04.070 --> 06:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
vaccination hence would not
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive a similar card
 
06:05:07.280 --> 06:05:09.350 align:start position:0%
be eligible to receive a similar card
follow-up

06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:05:10.830 --> 06:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
if we
 
06:05:13.510 --> 06:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
had to have something totally different
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that in a sense be
 
06:05:17.910 --> 06:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory towards those people that
 
06:05:21.270 --> 06:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a vaccine it just is an open
 
06:05:21.280 --> 06:05:24.788 align:start position:0%
don't have a vaccine it just is an open
door

06:05:24.788 --> 06:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:26.948 --> 06:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i'm not
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure if we're aware of anybody has
 
06:05:31.670 --> 06:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
requested a non-vaccine card at the
 
06:05:31.680 --> 06:05:32.788 align:start position:0%
requested a non-vaccine card at the
department

06:05:32.788 --> 06:05:32.798 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:05:34.868 --> 06:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
or a card saying that they haven't been
 
06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or they're they've chosen not
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
to have the vaccine is that correct um
 
06:05:40.868 --> 06:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
okay i am
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
sorry no okay i i think it's not just
 
06:05:45.670 --> 06:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
that but i'm thinking
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
if a card was issued
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
and someone wanted to go to a museum
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
that was not allowing people without a
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine but this person had
 
06:06:01.830 --> 06:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
an excuse a allowable excuse
 
06:06:04.628 --> 06:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
but they don't have a vaccine card
 
06:06:06.548 --> 06:06:06.558 align:start position:0%
so boom they can't go in
 
06:06:06.558 --> 06:06:07.430 align:start position:0%
so boom they can't go in
um

06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:11.030 --> 06:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
would you provide an identical card so
 
06:06:13.030 --> 06:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's proof that they've gone through the
 
06:06:13.040 --> 06:06:15.030 align:start position:0%
it's proof that they've gone through the
process

06:06:15.030 --> 06:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
and have that exemption
 
06:06:20.948 --> 06:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
so that they could get into that museum
 
06:06:23.030 --> 06:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i actually
 
06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
would think that that would be dependent
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
on what the regulations are of the
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
private business that's not accepting
 
06:06:28.080 --> 06:06:29.030 align:start position:0%
private business that's not accepting
them

06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
i mean just to say that i think that if
 
06:06:32.150 --> 06:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
you if they're saying that no one who
 
06:06:34.628 --> 06:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
who cannot be vaccinated can enter then
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
that probably i don't know if they're
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
they would accept religious or medical
 
06:06:41.590 --> 06:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
exemptions for entrants
 
06:06:43.590 --> 06:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at my card here and
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
holding up that other paper which says i
 
06:06:48.470 --> 06:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
have a religious exemption and you know
 
06:06:50.708 --> 06:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
what if i'm in a line of people
 
06:06:53.030 --> 06:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i they all have a nice card like
 
06:06:54.868 --> 06:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
this and i have this yellow paper with
 
06:06:57.270 --> 06:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
the other words on it i might feel uh
 
06:06:59.670 --> 06:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
that people are glaring at me if i'm
 
06:07:02.708 --> 06:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
lucky and worse if i'm not so i would
 
06:07:04.390 --> 06:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
you believe i
 
06:07:06.470 --> 06:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
see the merit in what representative
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
folsom is saying
 
06:07:11.670 --> 06:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
i would thank you representative weber
 
06:07:14.230 --> 06:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
but isn't the distinction there
 
06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
that the exemptions
 
06:07:16.638 --> 06:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
that the exemptions
are

06:07:17.430 --> 06:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:07:17.440 --> 06:07:18.548 align:start position:0%
are
either

06:07:18.548 --> 06:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
either
 
06:07:23.430 --> 06:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:23.440 --> 06:07:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
a

06:07:24.230 --> 06:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
medical provider's opinion
 
06:07:26.638 --> 06:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
medical provider's opinion
or

06:07:27.750 --> 06:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:07:32.310 --> 06:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
they are an exemption from a workplace
 
06:07:34.948 --> 06:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
and the department doesn't have anything
 
06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
to do at all currently
 
06:07:37.600 --> 06:07:38.948 align:start position:0%
to do at all currently
with

06:07:38.948 --> 06:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:07:42.470 --> 06:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
that and the issuing by the department
 
06:07:44.230 --> 06:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
of such a card
 
06:07:47.030 --> 06:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
would necessitate setting up
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
yet another registry is that true
 
06:07:51.910 --> 06:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct we would not have
 
06:07:54.390 --> 06:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
oversight um on
 
06:07:54.400 --> 06:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
oversight um on
on

06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
issuing any sort of card for that type
 
06:08:00.390 --> 06:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
of that's not within our purview
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
06:08:03.670 --> 06:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
i think mine similar just would you
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
agree that this bill has nothing to do
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
private places or anything this has to
 
06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
do only with
 
06:08:13.830 --> 06:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
the dhhs and it says you can't uh ask
 
06:08:15.270 --> 06:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
for a passport so there's no reason to
 
06:08:16.788 --> 06:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
worry about an alternate passport would
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
you agree with that
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of off topic to do this
 
06:08:23.430 --> 06:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree it's it's not um
 
06:08:25.110 --> 06:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're here to talk about the the
 
06:08:26.548 --> 06:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and i think those
 
06:08:28.390 --> 06:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
questions although thank you for asking
 
06:08:30.548 --> 06:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
them are not really under a purview
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that despite my
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
respect for the representative it does
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
not just talk about dhhs but it talks
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
about other political subdivisions and
 
06:08:43.670 --> 06:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
water districts
 
06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
but what it's saying is you cannot ask
 
06:08:46.470 --> 06:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
for it so why would we need to worry
 
06:08:48.070 --> 06:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
about an alternative for something that
 
06:08:49.590 --> 06:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
cannot be asked for
 
06:08:49.600 --> 06:08:50.548 align:start position:0%
cannot be asked for
okay

06:08:50.548 --> 06:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:08:52.390 --> 06:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:08:57.510 --> 06:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question so from what i read
 
06:08:59.030 --> 06:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
the only new part
 
06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
of this bill is the bold part everything
 
06:09:03.590 --> 06:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
else is current law
 
06:09:03.600 --> 06:09:04.868 align:start position:0%
else is current law
and

06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:06.390 --> 06:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
what the bold part
 
06:09:07.670 --> 06:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
06:09:07.680 --> 06:09:08.548 align:start position:0%
the uh
bold

06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
bold
 
06:09:08.558 --> 06:09:11.110 align:start position:0%
bold
text

06:09:11.110 --> 06:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
text
 
06:09:13.350 --> 06:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
seeks to do is just to make very clear
 
06:09:14.708 --> 06:09:14.718 align:start position:0%
that the department of health and human
 
06:09:14.718 --> 06:09:16.390 align:start position:0%
that the department of health and human
services

06:09:16.390 --> 06:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
services
 
06:09:19.110 --> 06:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
can't require some standardized form of
 
06:09:19.120 --> 06:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
can't require some standardized form of
of

06:09:20.070 --> 06:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
proof of vaccination in order for people
 
06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
to obtain
 
06:09:29.110 --> 06:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
dhhs governed benefits and services
 
06:09:29.120 --> 06:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
dhhs governed benefits and services
so

06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:32.708 --> 06:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's how i read the bill yes
 
06:09:37.270 --> 06:09:37.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:09:41.990 --> 06:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
therefore we're
 
06:09:42.000 --> 06:09:43.750 align:start position:0%
therefore we're
um

06:09:43.750 --> 06:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
i guess the
 
06:09:48.868 --> 06:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
oh i guess that's it thank you thank you
 
06:09:53.430 --> 06:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:55.110 --> 06:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
clarity on here
 
06:09:57.750 --> 06:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
the brand new part the brand new part of
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
seems to be
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
and this is really a question because i
 
06:10:04.788 --> 06:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
want to know if you think it does
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
can we just could we get the same
 
06:10:09.510 --> 06:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
meaning out of it by skipping the new
 
06:10:12.548 --> 06:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
words just adding in the
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
and then that would be protecting
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
everybody that you cannot
 
06:10:23.350 --> 06:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
need to show
 
06:10:23.360 --> 06:10:24.788 align:start position:0%
need to show
proof

06:10:24.788 --> 06:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
proof
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
well it says
 
06:10:28.470 --> 06:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
but on the first two lines it just says
 
06:10:29.350 --> 06:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
06:10:31.670 --> 06:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
need it so you wouldn't it would be
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
immaterial whether you had proof or not
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
yes we would agree with that yes so
 
06:10:37.990 --> 06:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
06:10:39.830 --> 06:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
who makes these you're on a roll who
 
06:10:41.830 --> 06:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
makes these cards
 
06:10:44.310 --> 06:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's just everybody who gave out
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
immunizations they gave cards is that
 
06:10:51.270 --> 06:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:52.708 --> 06:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
sure so the
 
06:10:52.718 --> 06:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
sure so the
cdc

06:10:54.070 --> 06:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
cdc
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
goes ahead and they issue the cards to
 
06:10:58.548 --> 06:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
the state and the providers who are in
 
06:11:00.470 --> 06:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
receipt of vaccine
 
06:11:02.948 --> 06:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
so as vaccines are being delivered
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're also receiving the cards to go
 
06:11:07.510 --> 06:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
alongside them so a vaccine
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
administrator would go ahead and have an
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
individual in front of them they would
 
06:11:13.350 --> 06:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
fill out the record at the time they
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
would hand the record over to the person
 
06:11:17.030 --> 06:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
who's receiving the vaccine or the
 
06:11:18.788 --> 06:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
parent or guardian
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
and then the vaccine registry a
 
06:11:23.350 --> 06:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up question yeah okay there's a
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine currently vaccine registry in
 
06:11:26.798 --> 06:11:28.070 align:start position:0%
vaccine currently vaccine registry in
flux

06:11:28.070 --> 06:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
flux
 
06:11:30.788 --> 06:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
so would the person giving the vaccine
 
06:11:33.990 --> 06:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
be the one to enter it into whatever
 
06:11:35.670 --> 06:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
system we have
 
06:11:41.110 --> 06:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:43.030 --> 06:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
the the information would flow to the
 
06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire iis or the registry
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
only if a person does not elect to opt
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
out of that so if a person says no i
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
don't want my information to flow that
 
06:11:55.750 --> 06:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
individual has the right to maintain
 
06:11:59.350 --> 06:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
that information on their own accord
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
if the vaccine were received at a
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy or provider's office where
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
there is an electronic medical record
 
06:12:06.000 --> 06:12:07.750 align:start position:0%
there is an electronic medical record
the

06:12:07.750 --> 06:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
medical record would show evidence of
 
06:12:12.470 --> 06:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccination and the person would be
 
06:12:13.990 --> 06:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
given the card so the person would be
 
06:12:16.948 --> 06:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
able to obtain a copy of that record if
 
06:12:18.548 --> 06:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
they were vaccinated in a provider
 
06:12:20.868 --> 06:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
office or elsewhere where there is an
 
06:12:23.590 --> 06:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
electronic medical record
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the opt out only applies to the
 
06:12:27.840 --> 06:12:29.270 align:start position:0%
and the opt out only applies to the
information

06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:12:31.590 --> 06:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
the iis the immunization immunization
 
06:12:31.600 --> 06:12:32.628 align:start position:0%
the iis the immunization immunization
system

06:12:32.628 --> 06:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:12:35.110 --> 06:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
where a person would elect to not have
 
06:12:37.750 --> 06:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
that information flow over and that
 
06:12:39.830 --> 06:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
information is controlled by the health
 
06:12:41.590 --> 06:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
care provider whether the information
 
06:12:44.390 --> 06:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
goes or not thank you
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
06:12:54.548 --> 06:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on house bill 1099 but
 
06:12:57.030 --> 06:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
my sense is there could be
 
06:12:59.110 --> 06:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment that some
 
06:13:01.190 --> 06:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
folks might like to work on
 
06:13:17.670 --> 06:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
would you like anyone to help you i know
 
06:13:22.628 --> 06:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
you can do it on your own but
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:37.990 --> 06:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
well we don't do that here for the most
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
part write minority reports because we
 
06:13:41.430 --> 06:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
all agree on things
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure you're going to do it
 
06:13:44.160 --> 06:13:47.750 align:start position:0%
so i'm sure you're going to do it
mostly

06:13:47.750 --> 06:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:49.510 --> 06:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the committee not leave
 
06:14:11.350 --> 06:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:14.070 --> 06:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely so so representative webber
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%

06:14:28.470 --> 06:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
numbers of people simultaneously about
 
06:14:30.830 --> 06:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
much the same thing i like that when it
 
06:14:35.910 --> 06:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
happens uh in terms of this language
 
06:14:38.788 --> 06:14:38.798 align:start position:0%

i don't know we could have two
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
amendments brought in or we could have
 
06:14:54.320 --> 06:14:55.190 align:start position:0%
amendments brought in or we could have
one

06:14:55.190 --> 06:14:55.200 align:start position:0%

06:15:32.150 --> 06:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
if they're not on the same issue
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
we can always as a committee adopt two
 
06:15:37.990 --> 06:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendments if we choose to do so
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
and ols will magically merge them into a
 
06:15:43.270 --> 06:15:43.280 align:start position:0%

house bill 1390 and the chair proudly
 
06:16:20.788 --> 06:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
turns it over to representative canark
 
06:16:23.350 --> 06:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
who will walk us through
 
06:16:25.750 --> 06:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
procedures like you've not necessarily
 
06:16:31.190 --> 06:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
we've already exact this before we're
 
06:16:39.770 --> 06:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:39.780 --> 06:17:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:17:00.470 --> 06:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.510 --> 06:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay get out 1390 if you have it you
 
06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
weren't uh told we were going to so you
 
06:17:13.270 --> 06:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:20.948 --> 06:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
all right representative canark walk us
 
06:17:25.350 --> 06:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
through the process please sir
 
06:17:27.030 --> 06:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay here's the problem
 
06:17:29.350 --> 06:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh we exact this
 
06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh last week or the week before it was
 
06:17:33.110 --> 06:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
last week i think it was this is the one
 
06:17:34.868 --> 06:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
that has to do with language translation
 
06:17:37.030 --> 06:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
services in telemedicine
 
06:17:39.430 --> 06:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that we identified at
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
that time is that it was actually placed
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the wrong rsa
 
06:17:46.150 --> 06:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
and john williams gave us guidance as to
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
which rsas to use we then i brought
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
forth an amendment which is the
 
06:17:50.638 --> 06:17:51.670 align:start position:0%
forth an amendment which is the
amendment

06:17:51.670 --> 06:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:17:53.830 --> 06:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't have it don't worry o
 
06:17:55.910 --> 06:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
two one zero and that was the one that
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
just placed it then the proper statutory
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
reference in new hampshire
 
06:18:01.590 --> 06:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
so i was then of course because i made
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
the motion was supposed to write the
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee report as i sat down to write
 
06:18:06.470 --> 06:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
the committee report being the
 
06:18:08.868 --> 06:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
compulsive retired surgeon i am just for
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
kicks i went to check the cfr
 
06:18:14.150 --> 06:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
citation uh that was in the original
 
06:18:16.150 --> 06:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill and the amendment for the record we
 
06:18:19.590 --> 06:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
executed on january 24th
 
06:18:19.600 --> 06:18:20.390 align:start position:0%
executed on january 24th
right

06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:18:21.910 --> 06:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
and uh when i checked that i was a
 
06:18:24.310 --> 06:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
little surprised because it was not the
 
06:18:24.320 --> 06:18:25.270 align:start position:0%
little surprised because it was not the
right

06:18:25.270 --> 06:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:18:28.628 --> 06:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh code of federal regulation citation
 
06:18:31.670 --> 06:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
it was citing uh cfr that had to do with
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
insurance exchanges that you know you
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
had to provide
 
06:18:37.510 --> 06:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
translation and so on and so forth for
 
06:18:39.270 --> 06:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
selling insurance had nothing to do with
 
06:18:40.708 --> 06:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
care and this bill has to do with
 
06:18:42.390 --> 06:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
providing care
 
06:18:44.708 --> 06:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind i worked then with
 
06:18:46.548 --> 06:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
the ols people
 
06:18:49.590 --> 06:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
we found the proper cfr reference
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we inserted that
 
06:18:53.670 --> 06:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
so this uh amendment that i've just
 
06:18:55.670 --> 06:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
brought to you which is number zero four
 
06:18:57.510 --> 06:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
zero nine h
 
06:19:00.548 --> 06:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
is a replace all amendment
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
what it does it's precisely the same as
 
06:19:05.910 --> 06:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
the one that we passed on the 24th
 
06:19:08.070 --> 06:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
except that it corrects the
 
06:19:11.628 --> 06:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
citations instead of 45 cfr one five
 
06:19:15.270 --> 06:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
155.205 it's 92.101
 
06:19:16.750 --> 06:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
and the other one is
 
06:19:19.910 --> 06:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
0.102 because 101 has to do with
 
06:19:22.230 --> 06:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
language access and 102 has to do with
 
06:19:25.750 --> 06:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
deaf and hard of hearing so the issue is
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's an error in citation so i worked
 
06:19:30.070 --> 06:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
with the clerk paul smith to sort out
 
06:19:32.390 --> 06:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
how he corrected the correction would be
 
06:19:33.670 --> 06:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
that we would i would move
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of our decision on the
 
06:19:38.150 --> 06:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill from before
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
then please everybody votes yes that
 
06:19:42.310 --> 06:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
means we can open that back up and
 
06:19:43.670 --> 06:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
reconsider it
 
06:19:45.430 --> 06:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i can do that because it was
 
06:19:47.350 --> 06:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
unanimous so we're all over there and
 
06:19:51.030 --> 06:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
then we will vote no on the otpa
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
with amendment zero two one zero which
 
06:19:55.750 --> 06:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
we passed back on the 24th you can just
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
offer a next amendment yes exactly you
 
06:20:00.070 --> 06:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to do no oh we don't even
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
have to say no so i will offer after
 
06:20:03.990 --> 06:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
reconsider i thought reconsideration was
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the vote that we'd made when you
 
06:20:07.510 --> 06:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider a vote you know
 
06:20:09.510 --> 06:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so we will reconsider the vote
 
06:20:11.190 --> 06:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
therefore we got this from the clerk
 
06:20:12.788 --> 06:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right so we yeah i wanted to
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
streamline it because my poor beth is
 
06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to pull her hair out but the
 
06:20:18.708 --> 06:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
strand by strand but the issue is if we
 
06:20:20.230 --> 06:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
reconsider that vote we can then
 
06:20:22.230 --> 06:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
overturn our previous decisions so it's
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
no longer have a recommendation then i
 
06:20:26.468 --> 06:20:26.478 align:start position:0%
will move the amendment we pass the
 
06:20:28.948 --> 06:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
amendment then we'll remove otpa we all
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
agreed with this bill as unanimous it's
 
06:20:32.548 --> 06:20:32.558 align:start position:0%
just simply to correct an error in
 
06:20:32.558 --> 06:20:33.750 align:start position:0%
just simply to correct an error in
citation

06:20:33.750 --> 06:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
citation
 
06:20:35.510 --> 06:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
so that's what this is all about it's a
 
06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
little complicated and you may wish that
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
i hadn't checked it but it was we didn't
 
06:20:41.270 --> 06:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
want to get into law incorrectly the
 
06:20:44.230 --> 06:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative connerk
 
06:20:46.708 --> 06:20:46.718 align:start position:0%

06:20:50.070 --> 06:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
like to move reconsideration on the
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
motion that we passed on the 24th which
 
06:20:55.830 --> 06:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
was on hb one three nine zero ought to
 
06:20:58.548 --> 06:20:58.558 align:start position:0%
pass with amendment zero two one zero
 
06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%

the new internet yeah i know what it
 
06:22:30.948 --> 06:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
is it's otp a with amendment zero two
 
06:22:32.070 --> 06:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
one zero
 
06:22:33.990 --> 06:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
no we have to vote down that's what i
 
06:22:35.430 --> 06:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
mean that's what i'm talking about what
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
the previous motion was otp a with
 
06:22:39.830 --> 06:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
amendment zero two one zero that needs
 
06:22:42.070 --> 06:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be voted down now we'd now have to do
 
06:22:45.430 --> 06:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
itl on that or no that was a that was an
 
06:22:48.070 --> 06:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
otpa we don't vote on itl we're now
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
reconsidering that vote we're saying we
 
06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
do not vote for it so a no vote will
 
06:22:53.760 --> 06:22:54.708 align:start position:0%
do not vote for it so a no vote will
kill

06:22:54.708 --> 06:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
kill
 
06:22:57.830 --> 06:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
the mistake yes the previous vote was
 
06:22:59.910 --> 06:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
just shall we think about it and do it
 
06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
okay uh chair will recognize somebody to
 
06:23:06.230 --> 06:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
make a motion um
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
reconsideration means we just re-vote on
 
06:23:10.788 --> 06:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
that vote as if we never voted the vote
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
the vote motion's already on the floor
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
we're reconsidering it
 
06:23:17.350 --> 06:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
now we have to vote yes but but they
 
06:23:19.030 --> 06:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
were reconsidering a vote that's there i
 
06:23:20.150 --> 06:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to make the new motion
 
06:23:21.750 --> 06:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
because now that means we have not acted
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
upon that motion that motion is now the
 
06:23:25.750 --> 06:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
motion on the table the motion on the
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
table is the bill we don't like we're
 
06:23:29.990 --> 06:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:23:31.670 --> 06:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
we we're starting over this yeah we're
 
06:23:33.670 --> 06:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
starting our basics
 
06:23:35.110 --> 06:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
though we had never voted on the
 
06:23:37.990 --> 06:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
previous otp okay so we never voted on
 
06:23:39.750 --> 06:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
the previous one i'm not sure that's
 
06:23:41.270 --> 06:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
what i had heard but
 
06:23:43.510 --> 06:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
we did but now we're voting on it as if
 
06:23:45.670 --> 06:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't vote on it right
 
06:23:50.070 --> 06:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
so that original bill as amended is now
 
06:23:58.310 --> 06:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not itling we're voting no on
 
06:24:02.310 --> 06:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
the otp
 
06:24:06.628 --> 06:24:06.638 align:start position:0%
the vote is on otpa and that is on
 
06:24:08.708 --> 06:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
what we had done
 
06:24:11.110 --> 06:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
amendment 0-2-1-0
 
06:24:12.788 --> 06:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
that is the old amendment okay good
 
06:24:15.670 --> 06:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
who's going to make that motion
 
06:24:16.948 --> 06:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to it's already on
 
06:24:26.310 --> 06:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:28.708 --> 06:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay when you are ready
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
