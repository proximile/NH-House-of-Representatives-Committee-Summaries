00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
a direct relation to uh the offense and
 
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
the profession um that they are
 
00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
practicing in and there's a bit of a
 
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
balancing test that's employed um with
 
00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
the burden being on the licensing board
 
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that somebody's more
 
00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 align:start position:0%
likely to reffund with the professional
 
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
license so with the current standard uh
 
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to deny a license
 
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
based on a criminal conviction alone now
 
00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
um putting the convictions aside um the
 
00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
issue from a lenser standpoint is always
 
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
going to be whether the conduct itself
 
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
um is considered professional misconduct
 
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
and um the one the one thing that I
 
00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to to note today which which is
 
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
it's in R and numeral 10 under 318
 
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
F20 it refers to it says this section
 
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
does not authorize any person to engage
 
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
in and does not prevent the imposition
 
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
of any penalties we engaging in the
 
00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 align:start position:0%
following conduct undertaking any task
 
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
under the influence of cannabis when
 
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
doing so would constitute negligence or
 
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
professional malpractice it wasn't clear
 
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
to me um whether malpractice is is the
 
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
best term to use from a legal standpoint
 
00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
malpractice is a particular type of
 
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
civil claim requires Duty breach
 
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
causation and damages in a licensing or
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary route we don't consider
 
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
damages and we don't consider
 
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
causation um so you may want to consider
 
00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
whether you changed the term
 
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
professional malpractice to Prof
 
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.830 align:start position:0%
professional malpractice to Prof
professional

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
misconduct um it will almost always be
 
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
professional misconduct to uh perform um
 
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
or provide services to a patient if you
 
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
are um using certain substances whether
 
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
they be prescribed or not prescribed um
 
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
if it's inhibiting your ability to do
 
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
the job safely it will not necessarily
 
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
be professional malpractice if you don't
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
cause harm to the patient so that's a
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
distinction that you may want to
 
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
consider um but that was the only thing
 
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
that popped out when I was Rie that I'd
 
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions
 
00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
Senator questions regarding professional
 
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
license chair than that one edit which
 
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
does everybody agree with that edit
 
00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
changing it from Mal practice to
 
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
misconduct think that was the word you
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
said Lindsay yes correct is everybody
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay with that change good any other
 
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
questions for Lindsay Lindsay do so some
 
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
of our lure the federal lure piece right
 
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm a little concerned about things like
 
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
electricians and HVAC that have to have
 
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.630 align:start position:0%
electricians and HVAC that have to have
special

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
licenses and can't that are subject to
 
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
potential random drug testing and POS
 
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 align:start position:0%
and and cite coming up up as positive
 
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
does that have how does that play into
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
this and how does that work so I think
 
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with a particular
 
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
license that issue um I know that there
 
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
could be concerns with DEA registrations
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
um obviously the state law you know to
 
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
the extent there would have to be like a
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
preemption analysis involved there so
 
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's not controlled by by state law so
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
it could be that um use of cannabis
 
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
under state law it's totally permissible
 
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
but it's not permissible and if you want
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
to get your da registration that would
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
they would have to follow the federal
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
law um I'm not aware of any other
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
Federal licenses from our standpoints we
 
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
see this a lot in variations of the law
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
between the states abortion is a primary
 
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
example right there are many different
 
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
abortion laws throughout the state
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
what's considered criminal and or not
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
lawful in other states may be considered
 
00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 align:start position:0%
lawful here vice versa um essentially
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
what we do is we apply the law in New
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if there's a preemption issue
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
um then certainly you know the federal
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
Authority could take a different
 
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
position but our perspective in New
 
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire under the licensing Authority
 
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
is that New Hampshire LW
 
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
governs anything else right represent K
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
I mean what about pilot Pilots so we
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
don't regulate Pilots uh under our
 
00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority so I can't speak I
 
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
can't speak to that
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative so I guess for the
 
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
committee convers one uh the state
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
regulates police
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
officers would you say that police
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
officers will be allowed to use
 
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana I would not be able to speak
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
to that I I don't have uh police
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
standards and training is not under our
 
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
agency that the Mr chair I mean the
 
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
chief brings up a great point I mean you
 
00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
can't have a gun and marijuana at the
 
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
same time
 
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
so I I would raise the ISS I think the
 
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
way you need to the way you might want
 
00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
to consider looking at the issue is um
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
is it goes back to my earlier comment is
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
a professional misconduct for a
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
professional to be engaging in certain
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
Behavior while on the job even if it's
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
legal if I were to be practicing law and
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
drinking alcohol all day which is
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly legal one may argue uh that at
 
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
some point I've crossed the line and I
 
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
could be subject to discipline by our
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority um so certainly
 
00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of conduct out there
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
that's legal but when um but you need to
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
have U there are ethical constraints as
 
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
to what you can
 
00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
do even if it is you know I mean there's
 
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues we're not really talking
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
about I mean for example you know I've
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
been I've been injured on the job
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
multiple times due to negligence of
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
people using drugs on the job mean I had
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
an amputation from it so you know what
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
happens when someone gets hurt at work
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
because they're high on the job you know
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
what I mean
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
like yes so I think that in reading the
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm not taking a
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other just to be
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
clear um in reading the legislation the
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority assuming there is a
 
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
licensing Authority would have the
 
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
ability to take action because the the
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
issue is is whether that person
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
committed professional misconduct and
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
providing Services while impaired which
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
is something that we routinely take
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
action on um right now and I don't see I
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anything in this uh
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
legislation that would prevent us uh
 
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
from doing that if this were to pass as
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
is and if if the commission believes
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would want to make clear
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
Authority anything else so again I I I
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
think some of the conversation we're
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
having and I'm not sure again this might
 
00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 align:start position:0%
be a majority Minority Report kind of
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
thing is again looking around this idea
 
00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
of non-discrimination for state legal
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis activities and prior
 
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
convictions right so we we have this
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
convers under under here it says
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
acceptance provided in the section a
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
hold of a professional occupational
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
license may not be subject professional
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
discipline for and B is engaging in
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
lawful activities of the state which is
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
marijuana consumption right so I guess
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
the question is around law enforcement
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
is one right we have a state
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
certification for law enforcement and if
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
you're if if you pop positive through
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
because you're going to be subject to
 
00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
random drug testing you can be generally
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
when you're involved in a in a critical
 
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
incident um you'll be drug tested and if
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
you pop positive does this prohibit law
 
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement from disciplining an officer
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
who may end up testing positive for th
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
presence it prohibits a police officer
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
even applying to be a police officer one
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
year prior okay so if they're using a
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
year prior to applying they're
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
ineligible to be a police officer so I
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
think that needs to be question how do
 
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
we deal with this non-discrimination
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
language when we have job functions in
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
the state um that necessarily would
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
would prohibit would would would
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
discriminate against testing if you test
 
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
positive you can't get a
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
license and yet this section would
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely prohibit that I mean don't
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
you think we should discriminate against
 
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
school bus drivers getting high not
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
argue who we should or should not
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
discriminate against all I'm saying is
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
that I think we have some discussion
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
that's to happen here or resolution or
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
whether we even take it up whether we
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
leave this language in there at all and
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
just leave it to um instead of having a
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
state law that says you can't
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
discriminate against when we have
 
00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
problems we leave that as an open item
 
00:08:20.749 --> 00:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
um either for the um policy board to
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
take up or for future legislation um not
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
include it in in the legalization
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
component one thing to consider Senator
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
if May is whether um the way we view
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
things in the office is there's a
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
distinction between employment decisions
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
and Licensing decisions licensing is
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
intended to ensure that you're minimally
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
competent that you have the basic skills
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that I want to hire you um
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so the question that you may want to
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
consider is um from a liur standpoint uh
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
do you find that the nondiscriminator
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory Clause should apply
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
to lure but allow employers to dictate
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
the terms of their employment that is
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
something that you can
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
consider I I think this talks
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
specifically about professional
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
occupational licensed positions right so
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a parking attendant
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
right but again police officer nurse
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
teacher school bus driver uh commercial
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
driver right these are all licensed
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
professional or occupational
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
licensees that I can see would want
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions on um that what when I
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
worked for the an Electric Co-op I had
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
to get drug tested right so was it was a
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
condition to my employment would I would
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
they be allowed to turn me down if I
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
tested positive at TH presence um
 
00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:41.959 align:start position:0%
working in in as an employer based on
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure they would um be able
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
to uh turn me down for or subject me to
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
discipline so that's my concern is
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
businesses that have implemented
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
standards we're now going to prohibit
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
those standards by passing the section
 
00:09:59.310 --> 00:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
my my reading I mean I I agree agree
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
with you and and you know we could
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
potentially be increaseing cost to
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
businesses because their insurance costs
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
are going to go up if they're not
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to just to have a drug-free
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
workplace you know we're going to be
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
business I also have a concern that
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
we're really just setting businesses up
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
for lawsuits just non-discriminatory
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits all the time well I I guess I
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
should have asked I know that I once I
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
used the word uh discrimination in a
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I got taken a task because we
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
have a whole Commission that talks about
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination and what discrimination
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
is and how it's applied and and I had to
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
change my bill because it had to deal
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
with the uh with with that one word and
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
because we have a commission that deals
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
with all the complaints around that um
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
you would had to create a special class
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
of people and the whole nine yards and
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
it was kind of ugly so um so that causes
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
me some concern we talk about
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
discrimination um so anyway thank you
 
00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:58.519 align:start position:0%
Lindsay I think everyone's good thank
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
you appreciate sh your
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
time all right so I forgot to go over
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
the minutes uh so we're going to back up
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
a minute and I'd entertain a motion to
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
adopt the minutes as written and
 
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.629 align:start position:0%
adopt the minutes as written and
presented

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
anybody it's been moved by Senator delis
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
sander second by um director mik is
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
there any changes or amendments to the
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
11:16 see none all those in favor say I
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
all oppose nay
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
I have it the minutes are adopted all
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
right so I we're in a hurry up and hold
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
mode I think daily daily can you check
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
with Ryan see where we are with red
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
lines because we can't we can't really
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
copy all right so why don't we do this
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
we'll take a a five minute break
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get those Redline copies
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
back um and we'll be able to move
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
forward with going through the red line
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
copies and make sure we cover all the
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
changes everyone's Mak you'll have in
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
front of you there's some language you
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
probably want to take read while we're
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
waiting you should have in your email
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
this morning you should have got some
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
recommended languages from Nami um on
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
what they want to see with that word
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
recovery and mental health um you have
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh on your desk you should have a copy
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
of some language around an nment that
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
was prevented by presented by Frank at
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
the ACLU um to take a look at as
 
00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
well and we'll take those changes up
 
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
also in the red light won't be in the
 
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
redline copy we'll be adding adding
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
those in addition to the redline
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
those in addition to the redline
copy

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
copy
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you guys five minute break
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
we'll be back at um
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
9:25 actually let's just say 9:30 let's
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:24:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
minute

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
right through it with my head down so I
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily see you raise your
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
hand so on the first page we struck uh
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh right at the top that whole uh number
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
one in
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
findings um on the
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
um down on number F on that first page
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
we changed uh will to shall we missed um
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
a change that I had I had written in so
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
it'll have to be added and it was that
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
marketing ad advertising the miners will
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
be prohibited as number G as letter G
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
should have been in there and it's not
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
there so we'll add that to the new bill
 
00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
um so again on the first page we have
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
the a through F we had put in number G
 
00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
we had added number G that just or
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
letter G G that said U marketing and
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
advertising the minor prohibited yeah I
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
had that note yep I had that note also
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
and then I had on F that we we struck
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
tax from CH fee no we just said Revenue
 
00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
rather than tax just that okay turning
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
two uh most of this involved um the
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
adding the word treatment in the funds
 
00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:25.870 align:start position:0%
adding the word treatment in the funds
yeah

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
doctor we had discussed last time also
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
saying uh substance use disorder as
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
opposed to substance abuse to be in uh
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the current language so
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
on page two what line number so it's on
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's essentially in probably 30 places
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the document but anytime it
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
says substance abuse to put substance
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
use disorder you should do a a search
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
for the whole document and replace it
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
yep so if I'm looking at this just right
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
at the top right we talk about uh uh
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
line 12 right so substance and you want
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
used to uh prevention or substance so
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
and so there's on line two on line five
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
on line seven um oh so it on line 14 on
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
12 14 it's in a lot of lot of I'm sorry
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
doctor just to be clear that it should
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
go from substance abuse to substance use
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
disorder so any place that says
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
substance abuse or substance misuse we
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
could put substance use disorder and
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
that would that would cover any of those
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
so for the entirety of the document
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:38.190 align:start position:0%
so for the entirety of the document
corre

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
um the other thing on on um you should
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
have gotten in your email this morning
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
um Nami finally sent us the language for
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
um the allocation component what they
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
were what they're asking well hold on
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
actually we have that in a different
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
section the allocation so we'll address
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
it in another section
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
um no actually that's not true one
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
out

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
easier uh that's
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
it no
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
that's so Nami wanted
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
section 26a
 
00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:49.630 align:start position:0%
section 26a
98

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
number looks like give me one second
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
guys trying to find it on the
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:59.470 align:start position:0%
guys trying to find it on the
page

00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
so under number five on page two um
 
00:28:03.559 --> 00:28:04.669 align:start position:0%
so under number five on page two um
letter

00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
B um the L right now you know you can
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
read what it has but Nami would like to
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
change that to is voluntary and
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
involuntary programs for mental health
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
treatment with or without substance use
 
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.990 align:start position:0%
treatment with or without substance use
disorder

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis so one more time it says
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary and involuntary programs for
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment with or without
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
a substance abuse
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
Disorder so basically would allow
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
funding to go to those that program is
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
that reasonable to everybody so we'll
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
add that in we'll we'll strike that and
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
replace um B with
 
00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:47.389 align:start position:0%
replace um B with
that

00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
Y Line
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
34 page
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
two line starting at line
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:58.389 align:start position:0%
two line starting at line

00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
um it's a different section of B uh
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
anybody have any other changes online on
 
00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.950 align:start position:0%
anybody have any other changes online on
page

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
two see I had
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
a coming back
 
00:29:17.919 --> 00:29:23.950 align:start position:0%
a coming back
to

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
three this was the issue about having a
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
right so Dave that was assignment I
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
think that was given to you about
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
changing language to say that the fund
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
would be spersed based on your
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
the you're good with it okay
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
great uh page three we struck section
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.509 align:start position:0%
great uh page three we struck section
five

00:29:58.509 --> 00:29:58.519 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
yep we added the word cultivating on
 
00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:05.149 align:start position:0%
yep we added the word cultivating on
line

00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
22 uh let me just harvesting and
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
cultivating cultivating and harvesting
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
yep it's in there sorry perfect they're
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:24.430 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
um okay anything else on three well
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
let's just just pause on the definition
 
00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
let's just just pause on the definition
of

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis and remember the conversation
 
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.029 align:start position:0%
cannabis and remember the conversation
about

00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
CBD I think that's covered though right
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
yep we wanted to make shall not include
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
hemp exctly right hemp by projects which
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
deals with the F Bill
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
four um we struck section six for um
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessory
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
retailer um we didn't break out like I
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
asked for a and d but that's fine
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
um I had on line eight I had a a flag
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
that instead of registered oh yeah I had
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
a liced yeah they added what they ended
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
up doing was just adding registered and
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
license so
 
00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:18.310 align:start position:0%
license so
me

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
um eight Dr I think you did you give us
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
a new definition for number eight the
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
Cannabis products definition looks like
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
we struck the term sh not apply to
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis in its plant or flower form I'm
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
but was that was that definition
 
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:44.430 align:start position:0%
but was that was that definition
okay

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay we we because because in the bill
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
we have cannabis retail store um
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
franchise and franchise cannabis retail
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
outlet defined in two different places
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
we just changed the Cannabis r retail
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
store rather than changing the bill in
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
every location was found just saying
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
that it refers to the def the other
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
definition if you see this it means that
 
00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:06.029 align:start position:0%
definition if you see this it means that
could

00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
I just before we get too far can we just
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
go back
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
to um five on page two R numer five I
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure uh is this saying
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
that my reading of this allocation shall
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
be used for one of the more of the
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
following so that does that
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
limit any any of the other funding or
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
there so that is a limiting factor so
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
that would be mean that these fourth
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
items are the are what can be used for
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
so again it could be used for but are we
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
talking about all the money that's
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
coming in from revenues because if that
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
only the revenue that's allocated to the
 
00:32:56.799 --> 00:32:58.870 align:start position:0%
only the revenue that's allocated to the
fund

00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
right so not not 100% of all the of the
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
money coming in but the money that's
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
allocated for the purposes of treatment
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
the 10% or 25 million I think was the
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
language that money could only be used
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
for these four subject items okay yeah
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
sorry to sorry back to where we
 
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.629 align:start position:0%
sorry to sorry back to where we
were

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
um nothing else on four going over to
 
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
five um we had a bunch of uh um
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
strikeouts and and number 17 18 19 all
 
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.789 align:start position:0%
strikeouts and and number 17 18 19 all
were

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.470 align:start position:0%
were
struck

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
struck
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
um I did have one note here and it was a
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to start a a war but the
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
question was around um I made a note
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
that online ordering but in store pickup
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
I had the same note no delivery but can
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
do inore in person pickup we want to be
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
able to allow them to be able to order
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
online but you have to go in the store
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
show your ID to pick up the order uh
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's just reasonable retail Market
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
marketing so is there a discussion
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
around that are we okay with that we add
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
that language in under the franchise
 
00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
retail anab
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
it I have a question sure if you allow
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
this will you will allow someone from
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts to order online or we'll
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
pick a state that's not legal order
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
online here in New Hampshire and come to
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and pick that up and take
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
it back home so the reality is the
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
answer is yes to that um but again we
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
would they can do that now they can
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
drive here and walk in the store and buy
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
it the only difference is we're on a on
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
a functional operational level we
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
allowing the store to be able to have
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
basically a pickup line that you've
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
already placed your order and just go
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
pick it up for streamline purposes
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
rather than walk in and have to go
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
select your
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
product but that same person would be
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
able to walk into any retail store and
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
buy in the Hampshire if you're from I
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
understand that I think that with the
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
online it would
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
facilitate the illegal Market in another
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
state and we're making it easier to do
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
that okay you're welcome to give a call
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
out note on the uh in the in the report
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
that you're concerned about that um for
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
the policy committee to take that topic
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
up Chief Mr I was going to say just much
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
like liquor if somebody orders from out
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
of state we don't penalize them or don't
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
allow them to do that they're not
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
breaking the law in the state of New
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.790 align:start position:0%
breaking the law in the state of New
Hampshire

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
and they would not be breaking if this
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
passed they would not be breaking the
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
law in the state of New Hampshire to
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
purchase it here so that that's the
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
premise behind the idea of people doing
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
it from out of state they have a second
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
home here they order product I
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
understand that but I I my concern is
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
that another state that it's not legal
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
there well if we I mean put the caveat
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
on it that it's not legal in another
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
state but they have a home here in New
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or they're coming here to New
 
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to visit they've rented a home
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
for a month they order it online they
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
pick it up and they're here but it's not
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
legal in the state that they're in
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
there's so many different C just
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
throwing that out because there's so
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
many different caveats to allow that
 
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.190 align:start position:0%
many different caveats to allow that
being

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
done so sen so we'll add it in that
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
online ordering but in store pickup is
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
allowed so it's so it's no question
 
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
about that um and then anybody wants to
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
add a comment line into the addendum
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
report for the bill um sen of whle
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
brought up under
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
16 um the last line that's currently
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
printed on there it says alternative
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
treatment centers cannot be licensed to
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
duly operate from the same location as a
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
franchise cannabis retail outlet I think
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
we struck that and it should be struck
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
because we've decided we're going to
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
allow dual use stores however if a if if
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to do medicinal and a and
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
ATC choose to move into the retail
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
Market they'll be governed 100% by The
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission no longer by DH H HS
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
if they want to stay in ATC they can and
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
just do therapeutic they can be
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
regulated over by DHHS is that where
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
everybody is
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
at okay so we're going to strike that
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
line that last sentence that says
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers cannot be
 
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
licensed to duly operate the same
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
location as a franchise retail outet
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're striking that
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
line um the next argument Point's going
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
to be number 21 we're talking about
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
possession limits um so this uses the
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
big change in here is in
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
um 5 gram of concentrated product um and
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
from down from 20 and then uh uh C is a
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
new line that I don't remember having a
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
conversation about but I'll leave it for
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
discussion cannabis products other than
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
concentrated Canabis products contain no
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
more than 80% concentration of THC M Mr
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
chair what's it so so let let's take
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
let's do them in order so let's start is
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with um a the under
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
possession limit
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
4 ounce possession we agreed to bring
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
that down to two ounces I do believe the
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
two was the conversation what I had in
 
00:38:08.349 --> 00:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
my notes um but I think the con the
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
problem with two in a retail environment
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
is someone who goes buys their weeks
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
worth of product and brings it home
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
would be violating if you had personal
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
consumption which is what we had before
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
you could have two ounces but and so I
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
think that's where the language is that
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're entering into a
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
retail Market we have a higher minimum
 
00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
position possession limit but and
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
anything above that is possession with
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
intent right so just remember anything
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
above the 4 oun is possession with
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
intent to sell um or at least that would
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
be the argument made by law enforcement
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
um is that it would be possession with
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
intent to sell your legal limit for
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
personal use is 4 ounces anything above
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
that it's not personal use
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
anymore so we're getting rid of all
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines on this not all guidelines
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
we're we're still setting a limit that
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
allows law enforcement to do their piece
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
um I the five grams versus 20 grams um
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
um and then the last one and this one
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'll need some help from the committee
 
00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
because again I don't remember a
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
conversation around this um cannabis
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
products containing no more than 80% of
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
concentration of THC I had that we were
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
doing 2,000 down to
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
500 that's what I had for a note but
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking the committee if
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
from any any of the ATC guys know the
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
the language came from the gentleman in
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
so cannabis product so again we're
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
talking about what a possession limit is
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis products other than
 
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.990 align:start position:0%
cannabis products other than
concentrated

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
concentrated
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis products containing no more
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
than 80% of concentration of THC does
 
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
anybody know where that language came
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
from well we we struck out the 2,000
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
milligrams because he told he well we
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
had I I had in here that we were
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
changing the change was that we were
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
going from 80% con that I don't know
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
where the 80% came in we were just going
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
to change 2,000 milligrams to 500
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
milligrams that's what I had too that's
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
what I have in my notes and I'm looking
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
head what's
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
it right so so how about we go back to
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the original language except for 2,000
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
we'll say 500 I mean I don't think we
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
should put any guidelines I think we
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
damn I just on that note I do think that
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
this is an area I'm sure that members
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
will want to provide additional comment
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the final report policy committee is
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
going to yeah any comment you want to
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
add you can for the report on those
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
possession limits and also again
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
remember the Pol this isn't the end
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
right this is just we're getting to the
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
beginning um of the bill which is it'll
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
go in front of the policy committee
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
whether in the senate or house for
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion on on possession
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
legis yeah it's going to be it's yeah um
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
and I and just a note on that I do think
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
it is important to make those comments
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
should you have them and I because that
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
I think will signal to to the policy
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee it right it will signal to the
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee discuss yeah where the
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
critical discussion points are so I do
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
think it's important to do that again it
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
this be a call out saying on possession
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
limits the committee was still have you
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:55.950 align:start position:0%
 
fa

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
well so I think again under under
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
B I think is where they're talking about
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
five grams for the purposes of
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
vaping I think the
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
um right under under go back under
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
possession limit
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
B and I think the second one was
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
relative you're right I think it was
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
relative to Edibles and the idea being
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
that I think somewhere along here we
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
talk about any single serving having
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
five milligram is that
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
right and so the idea being if you were
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
buying a package of 20 you'd have 100
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
potentially 100 milligrams in your
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
possession even though each serving is
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
only five milligrams right and so this
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
was to allow for a package of more than
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
one product I think that's what we're
 
00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:46.349 align:start position:0%
one product I think that's what we're
talking

00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
about it says other than concentrated
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
product cannabis products other than can
 
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.670 align:start position:0%
product cannabis products other than can
concentrated

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
concentrated
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
products so again I think this goes back
 
00:42:58.109 --> 00:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
to your gummy right one gummy may have 5
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
milligram of THC and you can hold a
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
package of 20 which would have 100
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
milligrams of THC and you're not be in
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
violation of the of the
 
00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
uh right so going 500 then
 
00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:13.079 align:start position:0%
500 should be I I don't know how many I
 
00:43:13.079 --> 00:43:16.750 align:start position:0%
500 should be I I don't know how many I
don't

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
know so you want to go to 100 I have no
 
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm open here I this language was
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
changed from what I had so in discussion
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
100 milligrams is
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
C okay that's right multiple right
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the issue is it so are you
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
saying that in any single container you
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
can only have 100 John and yet but you
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
can have up to five containers this
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
sentence is not
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
one well it's just a total possession
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
limit so we'll leave it at 500 then if
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
we think we need to again we can do a
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
call out note in the bill that just says
 
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
that in any whether a single package
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
contain no more than 100 and you're
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
total

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
total
 
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
total
yep

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.079 --> 00:44:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
um the next thing I had is I had us that
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
we struck the whole resident definition
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
because we already found a chapter of
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
law that Frank brought forward that
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
defines residents so that should be
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
struck again from the bill I had that
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
too be okay with
 
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.430 align:start position:0%
too be okay with
that

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
um then we get into the personal use
 
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
um then we get into the personal use
section

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh I had on line so we're on page
 
00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:08.109 align:start position:0%
uh I had on line so we're on page
six

00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.559 align:start position:0%
line uh
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
17 I think we said staff are of a
 
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
licensed cannabis product man I had that
 
00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
licensed cannabis product man I had that
as

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
well so right before the word cannabis
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
on line 17 we're just going to add the
 
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.549 align:start position:0%
on line 17 we're just going to add the
word

00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
licensed make it
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
clear we struck section two which was
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
language moving on to the next page this
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
is where we have our oh I'm sorry I'm
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
controlling and then to ask represent
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
hunt I had John's name next to each
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
other these two Provisions well they
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
well they both came from 639 um d and e
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
came from on page six came from six
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
639 I'm gonna leave them as they are
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
commission help me got it so we'll leave
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
it and we'll we'll we'll go on um so top
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
of page seven we have the um we have the
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
language again I'm going to ask that we
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
change that language to indicate our
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
will that there's a primary and a
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
secondary offense or a first offense and
 
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
a second offense and a second offense
 
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:35.480 align:start position:0%
should be enhanced penalties I'll leave
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
a note in I I'm going to put it as just
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor a violation of the
 
00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and then we leave a note to
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
talk about um beyond that for I know the
 
00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
Law Enforcement wants a Min minimum
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
penalty that's significant um and that
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
can be in the in the addendum
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
note so I think that's fine about the
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
note I mean I think think
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
we this was an area of obviously a lot
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
of conversation and so I think the only
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
consensus that was reached was some sort
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
of graduated approach so maybe we could
 
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
refer to it that way so I think we we
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
heard from the AG's office that again if
 
00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
you just put the word vist meter the
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
first assumption is assumed it's a b
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
which is no jail time potential but and
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily and then but allows
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
for a potential filing of paperwork to
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
allow for an a if someone's in their
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
fifth offense on the State House steps
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we could deal with it a little more
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
severely I'm wondering if uh for
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
purposes of just transferring this to
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature that we put in what the
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
existing laws with regard to marijuana
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
possession the the decriminalization I
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
mean with the three quarters of announc
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
or less which is the graduated offense
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
at Fourth offense triggers of be
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and so we have precedent for
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire law if we just put
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
that in as place like to leave it to the
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
policy committee right and so again
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's I think it's an area we're not
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
going to find a consensus in here to put
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
down um you know Law Enforcement wants
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
and heavier minimum standard minimum
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
fines um I think we just put that it's a
 
00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
violation of the mistim metor and let
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
the policy committee decide whether they
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
want minimum fines or anything else I
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to get there so
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not talking about possession
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about use we're talking
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
about but he's talking about possession
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
he's bringing up numbers of ounces we're
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
talking about use we don't want public
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
smoking right this is this is right this
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
is public consumption we're talking
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
about so first offense violation second
 
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
offense of misdemeanor and then we'll
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
leave it to the policy Comm to find it
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
any further but I don't think that we I
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
guess my point is that we didn't reach
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
consensus about violations and
 
00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to be clear like we the
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
conversation started on reducing 500 to
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
100 to be consistent with the existing
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
smoking policy I don't think we reached
 
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
consensus on misdemeanor or violation
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
then misdemeanor I I just don't think we
 
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
did so let's do it this way just do a
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
show a hands because again I think who's
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
in favor of having enhanced penalties on
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
a second
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.109 align:start position:0%
a second
offense

00:48:56.109 --> 00:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
the first well again I'm just talking
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
about the second offense that's really
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
we I think we all agree it's violation
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
on the first offense say enhanced
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
penalties on the second offense enhanced
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
penalties and they decide what the level
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
of that penalty would be right right
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
they can any aggravated meting
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances can command that why it
 
00:49:13.549 --> 00:49:13.559 align:start position:0%
might be a b and why it might be an a
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's up to law enforcement and in the
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement action to take yeah I guess
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
I just to clarify I am fine with an
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalty on the second offense
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm not okay with it automatically
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
being a misdemeanor I guess that's my
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
point so so you have apparently your
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
homework to write a note for the
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
addendum I already put it in my
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
note so um so we'll just rewrite that
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
again just saying that the first offense
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
violation second offense of misdemeanor
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
with an a call out just saying we
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to an agreement on
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
penalties um why I don't see why would
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
we put a misdemeanor in there if we put
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
that language if we're not in agreement
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
that why don't we put that we there's an
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
agreement that should be a graduated
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
penalty and leave it for the policy
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
people to going from violation to a b is
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
a violation going from a violation to a
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
b is an enhanced penalty otherwise you
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
just have violation of violation with
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
more fine which we're already giving the
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
judge a latitude on fine but I think the
 
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
point and it doesn't mean a officer
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
could ple it down too sorry interrupt no
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
no no I I I agree I agree I think the
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
point was like you could have we had
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
actually talked about that graduated you
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
know going from 100 to 500 that was
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
where we agreed on and and so I agree
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
that the note in there should be that
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
the the committee did not reach
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
consensus on what what the penalty
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
graduated it in you got to put it in you
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
can't say we agree on it we got you got
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
to say what the second second use is and
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I want to leave it to the
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
policy committee right let's let the
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
criminal justice policy committee either
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
in the house or the Judiciary here in
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate deal with what that looks
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
like I think that we all agree again
 
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
that if I just put the first defense is
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
a violation and we don't allow for the
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
potential upcharging to a misdemeanor
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
for any reason then that's not I think
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
the will was clear we want an upcharging
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
of that VI of that second offense I
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what that looks like I want
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
to leave it as leave it to the uh policy
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee no and I guess what what I'm
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
saying and what he's saying is that we
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
did not agree that we did not agree
 
00:51:18.789 --> 00:51:18.799 align:start position:0%
about that would be the graduated set of
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
penalties right we did not agree that it
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
would go from violation to misdemeanor
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
on the second offense we didn't agree on
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
that age I I this way we're not going to
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
find consensus here but I think we need
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
to give the policy committee a direction
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
that says that first offense and second
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
offense are different I just have a kind
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
maybe a naive question but if the
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of this committee is to provide
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation on the feasibility of
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislation right then why are we going
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
line by line on legislation and not just
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
writing up a report about some of these
 
00:51:51.309 --> 00:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
some of these barriers and boundaries on
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
these main topics because because it
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
seems like we're when it gets down to
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
brass tax the the reigning thought is
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
well we'll just punt that to the you
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
know for other people to to do but I
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're half doing it half not
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
so again the idea being is we're trying
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is supposed to be a set of
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines that put the most clean
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions in but again we're not going
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
to get to a 100% agreement on some of
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
this we have some people are going to be
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
a no no matter what we say in this room
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
right so we're not going to get to 100%
 
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
consump uh uh consensus so in places
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
where we can agree we want to highlight
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
that and give that the legisl in place
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
we can't we want to make sure we do a
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
call out after the after we have a
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
defined Bill we we call out these areas
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
still need further
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
compensation so banging through the
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
bill so we're on line seven uh we're
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
moving on to consumption while
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
operating um and the big the the we are
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay with one and two um on line three
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
we change it to a misdemeanor and a fine
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
not to exceed
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:03.549 align:start position:0%
not to exceed
$1,000

00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
there's any other changes there this is
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
my own this is the um we have a couple
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
changes already to
 
00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
us um moving on to any uh we struck uh I
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
have that we struck number five you guys
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
have that on your
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
notes I have it crossed out a strike
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
I thought we were going to strike it
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
only if we couldn't find that it was
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
clearly already um
 
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
protected but I don't know whose
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
homework assignment that was I just
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
haven't I have't crossed out that in the
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
conversation we chose to strike that
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
language in because we couldn't come
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
to you know and that's virtually cut and
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
pasted from existing precent so we don't
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
need to codify us not codifying that
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the law if anything we
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
might change make confusion so there
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't need to do that we'll strike
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
five well I just want to take a pause on
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
that because I
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not sure I was even part of
 
00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:07.470 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not sure I was even part of
that

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
conversation what can you just Express
 
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
what the concerns were with five again
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
so 265a is the DUI
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
Statute in that underneath there so
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
um I again if a police officer pulls
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
over someone who's smoking
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana it pulls up and the car is hot
 
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
booxed and they're driving down the road
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
and they have weaving and they pop them
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
for DUI they should also be able to pop
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
for consumption if they have evidence of
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
consumption in a in a motor vehicle so
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
my concern with eliminating this alog
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
together is that one of the reasons why
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
I am very supportive of legalization is
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
because of the sort of
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
disproportionate you know use of um
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
stops for people of color and using you
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
know cannabis as one of those I wouldn't
 
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
say pretext but the reason and so I
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a a very important part
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
that um is you know part of the overall
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
conversation for many folks about uh why
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
legalization is really
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
necessary so what I'll tell you is this
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
you get pulled over anyone doesn't
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
matter what your race is your religion
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
and it smells like marijuana in the
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle it's it's there's no reason to
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe crime has occurred just descent
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
alone that's what the Supreme Court
 
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
ruled so it doesn't matter ending be
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
putting that in here any further you
 
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to you don't have to actually
 
00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
put it in the bill right and that's that
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
adding that in there it's unnecessary
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
language so it's this we're not saying
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
that we're not getting into whether it's
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
a disproportionate impact or not this
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
applies to everyone every single person
 
00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
they get stopped the scent of marijuana
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
alone is not probably cost the search
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
because there's no reason to believe a
 
00:55:59.710 --> 00:55:59.720 align:start position:0%
crime has occurred because if it's
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
decriminalized and that's why the the uh
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and New Hampshire already
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
made that so well again so let let's
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
back up because again we're to be clear
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about consumption of
 
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana in a motor vehicle um is
 
00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited and um while operating and so
 
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
the question is can you charge somebody
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
with consumption of marijuana and
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
impaired driving at the same time if we
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
leave this in you would not be able to
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
if we'd strike it out then you'd be able
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
to charge him with both consumption of a
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
mo in um while operating a motor vehicle
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
as well as operating a vehicle while
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
impaired I think that's a reasonable law
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
I think that's a reasonable
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation we want to prohibit and
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
make sure people are not consuming uh
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana while driving a vehicle um and
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
so if the officer has evidence of both
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
and can prove Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
both we should be allow the charge for
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
both but if we put this in we wouldn't
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
be able to you had to pick one or the
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
other Chief and then Tim if you include
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
an open container
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
right provision you should be able to
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
charge under that in addition to
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
operating Under the Influence so I think
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's important to have in here that no
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
open containers
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
period open containers I'm not sure how
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
you proove open container from marijuana
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
but um but again I think I think the
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
consumption component is important that
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
if you improve consumption so we're
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to go to Tim Frank did you have
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
something no and then and Senor Whitley
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna bring up you know an
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
open container you know you can get
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
charged for an open container and oui at
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
the same time so you know I think you're
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
right we should strike this
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
and real simple all those in favor of
 
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
striking I had a comment go ahead back
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I just wanted to respond
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
to what Senator abbis said about you
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
know there's a Supreme Court case that
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
already addresses this and that may be I
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
I I haven't seen that case so I can't
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
speak to that but we are the legislature
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
and you know as we know president some
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
times you know can change and I think if
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
it's a policy issue that the legislature
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
needs to address I don't want to rely on
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case I think it should
 
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
be in the statute so I guess this is an
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
area where many of us will have to
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
provide a comment right so again you can
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
add an addendum note and send it to uh
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
Senator abis and you can add it as an
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
addendum as a policy area we disagree
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
with it you disagree with striking it
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
but all those in favor of striking
 
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
number five raise your
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
hand so the majority of the committee is
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
in favor so we'll strike number five
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
moving on on to number um line 27 we
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
struck this whole
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
section um moving on to the bottom of
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
page seven we're okay there moving on to
 
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.390 align:start position:0%
page seven we're okay there moving on to
page

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:43.150 align:start position:0%
 
eight

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
um we added at the bottom of ran numeral
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
2 we added New Hampshire State Police to
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
make sure they're included included in
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
that the rest of page eight is the
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:59.470 align:start position:0%
that the rest of page eight is the
same

00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
on the top of the next page on P does
 
00:59:03.789 --> 00:59:03.799 align:start position:0%
anybody have any comments on page
 
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:08.359 align:start position:0%
eight none page nine and just to be
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
clear um Senator Lang and I didn't
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
unable to compare our notes over the uh
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
long weekend shall we say so if there's
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
anything missing that should be in it's
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
not in there I do have the word document
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
pulled up I can add add that to
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
it just going to say the b botom of Nine
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
the 24 months yep yeah yeah well there's
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
still something at the top so again I
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
had a note on mine on my drafts on top
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
when we talked about the commission
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
shall not apply penalties such as
 
00:59:39.029 --> 00:59:39.039 align:start position:0%
license suspension for an indefinite
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
period of time and I had the word
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
revocation written down and I'm not sure
 
00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
why um we and we remember what that
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
conversation were were we changing
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
suspensions to revocations
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
or if not I'll leave it as it is
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
remember why I wrote that note seven and
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
eight were okay okay no changes so this
 
00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
is where we get into the timeline uh
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
everywhere it said 24 months we're
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
changing it to 30 months throughout the
 
01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.750 align:start position:0%
changing it to 30 months throughout the
entire

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
30 again nothing
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
prohibits liquor from coming in sooner
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
um it just gives them a top a a deadline
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
that they have to meet so I have no
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
changes on page
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:26.029 align:start position:0%
changes on page
10

01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
yes or vice chair it looks like we did
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
strike special seasonal franchise
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail outlet so that is a
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
change line 36 uh Daryl where are we
 
01:00:38.910 --> 01:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
right here this this you struck this but
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't in our notes we didn't strike
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
struck thank you
 
01:00:50.589 --> 01:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
Tim represent
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
K uh let darl answer then we'll go to
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
you Doctor how exactly would you do a
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
special seasonal franchise oh and I I
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
would prer
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
to from The Liquor Commission can
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
explain that it didn't seem like you'd
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
St yeah the only way something like that
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
could happen is if someone wanted to
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
open a seasonal store in the beach area
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
or up North during ski season that's the
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
only we we've we've looked at it over
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
the years with liquor to open seasonal
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
stores in different areas I think that's
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
originally why the language was put in
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
there but it's it's
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so the question is do we
 
01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
need to strike it or should we leave it
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
just on the off chance as a reason why
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
we you want to open a season if we
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
strike it I'm not sure necessarily you
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
can um but
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
this I think it should be stricken it
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
okay page
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
11 Senator oh I'm sorry dror
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so on um page 10 line 43 um about the
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
training I certainly we would advocate
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
for some pretty robust training and my
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
understanding um is that currently like
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
you're a bartender in the state you have
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
to do some annual training but having
 
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
something that says you know not
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
recommended like mandatory training and
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
continuing education required for lenses
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
and all franchise uh retail outlet
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
employees at least annually um and then
 
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
maybe something which shall include but
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
not limited to training because
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
obviously just being able to check an ID
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
and for false ID is probably inadequate
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
um so say like that's like the bare
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
minimum but really we would want some
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
more robust training about you know
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
potency and um High SL low that sort of
 
01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:44.559 align:start position:0%
thing so how doctor how do you feel if
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
we add right at the the first word we
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
just say annual mandatory training
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
continue education required are
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
recommended for lenses and all franchise
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
Canabis retail outlet employees which
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
shall include but not limited
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
to that work can we get rid of
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
recommended because like for liquor it's
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
not recommend is everybody okay with
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
Shri recom making a mandatory training
 
01:03:08.069 --> 01:03:08.079 align:start position:0%
requirement annual training requirement
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
for all
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
licenses I don't see any NOS to that so
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
recommended annual here put um instead
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
of anual right angle in front remove
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations and then put shall
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
include but not limited
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
to and I'll give you all my notes for
 
01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
the CH let's
 
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.470 align:start position:0%
the CH let's
do

01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
E I had this actually as just an area to
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
come back to with some homework and I
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
have something about adding a procedure
 
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.430 align:start position:0%
have something about adding a procedure
for

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
franchise as well
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
well I have it as struck so I don't I
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't have comment on this because the
 
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
it is there anyone that wishes to keep
 
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
keep the language
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
in so moving on we'll leave it
 
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.710 align:start position:0%
in so moving on we'll leave it
struck

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
struck
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
um the other note I had was on G yeah um
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
I had we were adding the word and dis
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications and disqualifications so
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
what what would disqualify somebody as
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
well as what qualifies somebody so I
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
have a note here that the ACLU was
 
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
working on language for that so I think
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
it was added in here G um I think we
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
were trying to just clarify that people
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
with past criminal convictions for
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
possession would not be discriminated
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
against so it looks like it was
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
incorporated here
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
great so we okay with adding or
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
disqualifications to that as well as the
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
language Frank has specifically about
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
previous convictions Chief G um wanted
 
01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people that were
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
convicted of
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
distribution um wanted to make that we
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's why we emphasize by
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
expressly saying possession Yeah by
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
saying possession you know possession
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
with intent distribution illegal
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
harvesting illegal trafficking all that
 
01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
would that's that could still be re the
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
the banit or disqualify it possession
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
alone would and that's Prett I mean
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with alcohol if you
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
have a you know with minor in possession
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
of of alcohol can still be a bartender
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
or work work around liquor
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
so so we'll add the qual We'll add
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
qualifications or disqualification for
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
license that are directly
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
demonstrable um and and include the
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
language from theu on I we added um
 
01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
distribution tracking do we was it
 
01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be warehouse and
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
distribution so that's in a j so if we
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
can any recommended language if you have
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
it Now's the Time because I can
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
literally put it in now and I'm you know
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
not g to stay at the midnight before you
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
got here Senator Lang and I were both
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
taking notes on our on this documents
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
I'll give I'll give changes but I can
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
type it as we go yep that's fine do be
 
01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.589 align:start position:0%
type it as we go yep that's fine do be
less

01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:06:20.599 --> 01:06:22.990 align:start position:0%
less
work

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
um right so under I we added the word
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
distribution and then under J we added
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
warehousing and distribution transport a
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
distributed so those are
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
12 we struck um section three all
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
I think this again
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
goes the idea that we're you'll either
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
be an ATC or a retail Center you won't
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
be both but if you're an ATC that
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
chooses to move to a for-profit retail
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
Center um you'll be managed by liquor if
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
DHHS

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
and again because we struck three we
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
struck all of the sub subp parts of
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
three to go with it on line
 
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.990 align:start position:0%
three to go with it on line
37

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
37
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
30 with line 37 of page 13 does that
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
need to be 24 months or 30 30 everywhere
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
months can we go back to page 11 for a
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
second yep give me one second let just
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
finish where Daryl is so on line 40 um
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
we the rule the rulle shall include but
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
following sorry go back to P which page
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Chief page
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
11 and I'm looking at paragraph L
 
01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.910 align:start position:0%
11 and I'm looking at paragraph L
section

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
L do we want to denote in here that it
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
should be an opin for local communities
 
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
versus I think that's later on in the
 
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.349 align:start position:0%
versus I think that's later on in the
bill

01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
okay I just want to later on the bill we
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
have what what communities are allowed
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
do the 13 other than uh but but not
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
limited to on the regulatory
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.839 --> 01:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
 
page

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
um Senator Lang on um C on line 14 on
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
page 14 I think think in terms of uh
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
potency limits I know Kate from new
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
Futures handed out an updated document
 
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
around potency limits I didn't know if
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
it'd be worth having Kate come up real
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
quick if we want to quickly talk through
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
that sorry s where are we talking right
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
got to talk a little louder in your
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
microphone you're sorry ask um on line
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh 11c in terms of I'm sorry looking at
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
the wrong version uh line 14 C around
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
the potency limits page 14 on page 14
 
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.709 align:start position:0%
the potency limits page 14 on page 14
yes

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:22.719 --> 01:09:25.669 align:start position:0%
yes
y

01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
y
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
so and and who and new future submitted
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
Kate Kate we want to come up and just
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
quick talk about uh again the 20
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
milligram versus
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh is that this is that
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
this Kate is that this document that you
 
01:09:42.239 --> 01:09:45.349 align:start position:0%
this Kate is that this document that you
gave

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
us it is um my name is Kate fry um vice
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
president of advocacy at new Futures
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
I'll be speaking into that document but
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
but I but thought I should o point out
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
none of the suggested changes that we
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
had indicated before had made it to this
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
draft I don't know if it's something
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
that maybe is later on but um on page 14
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that the
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee did decide that 20 milligrams
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
for um serving size should be changed to
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
well so again now we're going back to
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
the conversation of
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
product serving a single serving and how
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
much cannabis milligrams of THC a
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
product's allowed to have I think five
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
was the number edible yeah five was the
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
number and the thought was if you can't
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
go from 10 to five that would be
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
problematic if if ever want that is Ever
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
Raised you know to 10 you know we'll
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
deal with that then but we can't I it's
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
too hard to go backwards and I think so
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
so are we so the com was a five
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
milligrams per serving basically we we
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
we totally talked about this a ton and
 
01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
we agreed on five yeah correct so we'll
 
01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
change out the
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
five just make sure we we're talking
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
about the same thing the way it says
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
included in each cannabis product is my
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
memory this is only Edibles this is only
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't say Edibles to me it looks like
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're going to say even a uh a
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
joint when someone buys it pre-rolled
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's no way we're Limited
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't know how much is in there
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
this is if you if you go back to where
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
the whole conversation around the
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
five was it's about you which back
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
five you have 4 ounces of cannabis in
 
01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.110 align:start position:0%
five you have 4 ounces of cannabis in
plant

01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:11:51.870 --> 01:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
form five grams of concentrated canvas
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
products would includes as the con so
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
the key word is
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
concentrated so that that this here when
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
you put in that uh that new your new
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
definition you want to say the con it's
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
the concentrated
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis not Canabis concentrated can
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
but the definition of cannabis product
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh this term shall not include cannabis
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
in its plant or flower form so it's a
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
joint example wouldn't be applicable
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
because did that was in the beginning of
 
01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
this paragraph that is in a definition
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
section on looking at this here and if
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
you drop that to five I'm concerned you
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
created some confusion in the statute
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
well I think I think under the product
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
definition we exclude plant so it would
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
not this would provision wouldn't apply
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
I think five milligrams I'm not com to
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
with the last sentence though except
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
there may be changed through rule making
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
I think that's a legislative function
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
and I think we should strike that and
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
let the legislature make a decision on
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
if this goes to 10 down the
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
road we shouldn't abgate our rule our
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislate we could we finish up with uh
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
let's finish up with with section c
 
01:13:07.229 --> 01:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
first then we'll move on to the next one
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
right so is everybody okay we're going
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
to change the 20 milligrams to 5
 
01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
milligrams and strike that last after
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
the comma but a period after milligrams
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I had in my notes
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
anyway yes okay Doctor back to you um so
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
just going back slightly to U line for
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
for the um prohibitions on um things
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
that make the product more appealing to
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
Children maybe spec helpful to have a
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more expansion in the
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
diagnosis or in the definition um you
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
know saying things like bright colors
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
characters toys things uh to avoid
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
somebody saying well I didn't mean to
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
Market this to children but they found
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
it attractive um just a little more
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
specificity to hold people accountable
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
for making things that aren't account or
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
aren't appealing to
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
children but the children are not even
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
allowed in the stores right but if you
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
have like you know I go to the store and
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
get something that's you know shaped
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
like Minnie Mouse and I bring it home my
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
kids's more likely to think it's candy
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
or find it appealing to eat than if it's
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
clear and round um so I just think you
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
know just saying something that's you
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
know like you know excluding things that
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
are brightly colored you know shaped
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
like characters or toys or you know
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
commercially marketed candy um I think
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have that in here later on we talk
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
about the control that liquor has
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
on pack the get get Mr mol upset but we
 
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
just saw this in our beer labeling right
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
conversation right and so all over again
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
we already have some controls and
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
conditions relative to marketing the
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
children in the in the ru making and
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
later on in this bill as well it's
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
spelled out on page 15 and 16 pretty
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
well we were looking for that it looks
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
like anything in the candy aisle at a
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
checkout line so I would say they going
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
to be in trouble and so the commission
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
always has the right to reject right if
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's again they they make it look look
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
like a Tim's gummy bears over there um
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
if they make it look like that they can
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
say no this is not on this form is not
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
allowed right kind of thing so I had
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
another comment yes uh I had also that
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
we had extensive conversation about
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
adding as new Futures had suggested a
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
public health advisory committee and on
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
their memo on page three of their memo
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
language what page where was let me see
 
01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
you don't mind I gotta find where this
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
was in the bill oh it's a completely new
 
01:15:33.669 --> 01:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
language yeah and it was around this
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
area which section will we added to I'll
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
just type
 
01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
just type
in

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
you yes this was in our October 30th
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
mimo that it was presented that it is a
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
way to just to address what you brought
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
up later if it we find that that amount
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
like the potency amounts or the serving
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
amount should be changed that the
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
commission could convene a public health
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
advisory commission to make these
 
01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
suggestions guidelines only um and that
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
that was agreed to by the group it is
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
not meant to make any business
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
decisions I'm sorry Kate do the language
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
that so you gave us a memo dated
 
01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:14.030 align:start position:0%
that so you gave us a memo dated
November

01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
27th are c and d a a additions to what
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
you provided in the previous memo so
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
that today's my Mo something um
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
different based on the discussion last
 
01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
week so just to wrap up what we were
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the public health advisory
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
commission that was something that this
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee discussed this commission
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussed let's put the I think I think
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement that'll be an
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
advisory commission but let's take that
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll figure out where to put it as
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
we get through the rest of the bill yeah
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll as again an item that we'll
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
add in there I think we all agree on an
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
advisory level type of committee um
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
that'll include law enforcement and
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
public health officials um
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
and uh but let's figure out we'll add it
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
as a at the end of the page now where do
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
we want to insert this kind of thing and
 
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
what what should it look like but the so
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
I think we agreed on my point is I guess
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
we agreed on number eight just the
 
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
creation of the advisory committee but I
 
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
think what new Futures is suggesting in
 
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
their memo of today is this additional
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
language about what the advisory
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee shall do correct well actually
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
this discussion is a yeah it's it is
 
01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
related to the public health advisory
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
commission too so this was just um
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussion that happened last I think it
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
was on November 16th about whether
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis potency limit should be in
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
statute versus rulemaking there was a a
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
lot of conversation about that and even
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
a representative from Granite Leaf ATC
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
said they prefer to actually have it in
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
statute uh new Futures has said that all
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
along too so what I was just pointing
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
out was some suggested language from Dr
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
Lynn silver where she does put in a
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
potency amount for cannabis products and
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
then she had some other language about
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's the that's the limit for
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
three years and then and a group can
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
look at changing that I put in that
 
01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
public health advisory commission
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
language as being that body because this
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
group had agreed on having that so that
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
just to me made the most sense that they
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
were the body that approved it so and
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
which section I'm sorry it which section
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
was potent limits is discussed on page
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
16 okay line 27 we'll get thank you so I
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
think we'll add advisory commission what
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
its role and responsibility is and who
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
will be who the makeup of that
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
commission it's not in here now but
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out where to add that into
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
the bill when we get to the end on big
 
01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
policy ads that are not covered by the
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
current draft and lastly was the
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
medication um lock boxes that was agreed
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
on by the commission to S have the
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
franchise storees sell the medication um
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
lock boxes I'm not sure where that is in
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
here we'll see if we it's not in here in
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
the new draft it's not in here no none
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
of these things that we just discussed
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
are in
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
here therapeutic would need to be sold
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
in a lock with a lock box is that it's
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
not being sold that the it's that
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who is selling cannabis products
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
must also offer a lock box as part of
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
the condition of having a license that
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
you have to have a lock box for sale
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to sell it someone wants it
 
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
but they have to make it at that's a
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
requirement that has to be sold at the
 
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.470 align:start position:0%
requirement that has to be sold at the
franchise

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
stores I mean so I just wanted to point
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
out that not not only is that memo
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
Language new but everything that was
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
discussed from that November 30th looks
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
like it didn't make that this St right
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so um so we'll we'll take up
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
the the uh commission later anything
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
15

01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
I think I only had one typo on letter A
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
the word that should have been added on
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
line 11 L um has there been any
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about having um a placard or
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
something at a at a retail facility like
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
I've see popped up everywhere now about
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
smoking I don't know every that's later
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
on in the bill that there is there is
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
some provision that talks about the fact
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
that there'll be regulatory mandatory
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
locations

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
so Chief back to our so Mr mik again go
 
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
on letter e did we decide that this was
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
drafted out about again this is talking
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
about um rule making authority of the
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
commission to to Draft rules and some
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
recommended um topics to start off with
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
again these are um including but not
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
limited to languages so that I just had
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
a call out on letter e about the
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
packaging and miners but I'm not sure we
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
need any more discussion on that
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
well is this the
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
area um where Dr jren would suggest so
 
01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:02.709 align:start position:0%
area um where Dr jren would suggest so
uh

01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:02.719 --> 01:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
uh
online

01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
26 adding a comma such as Dr youngren
 
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:16.629 align:start position:0%
26 adding a comma such as Dr youngren
think

01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
Miss so we're all set all set cool
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
anything else on
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
15 nope moving
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
16 Senator L I think on page 16 we had
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
talked about adding a recall procedure
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
rule I don't see it that was going to be
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
um number nine it actually will end up
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
on page 17 but U we had number nine to
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that they Draft rules
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
regarding recalls and and notification
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
procedures is is there any any any
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
language you have to I can add it right
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
now so well so again on number seven we
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:05.180 align:start position:0%
months um
 
01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:07.430 align:start position:0%
months um
[Music]

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
number eight we got to change it to 30
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
months some reason we have 36 in there
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
is there you said you wanted to add a r
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
number eight though for recall is was
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
there any recall language that we had
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
nope again this is just the just saying
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
that as part of their rule this is all
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
under the rulemaking authority of of the
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
commission we want to make sure that as
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
part of rul making they addressed any
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
recall and notification Provisions
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
necessary for the retail outlets and
 
01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
necessary for the retail outlets and
consumer

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
protection uh I had a note that number
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
on back on sorry page 16 and we got it
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
so we added a uh just that government
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
issued ID was I had note but it doesn't
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
look we do to change
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
anything Mr chair on the top of 17 that
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
should remain 36 months that's relative
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
to hemp discussion on hemp not cannabis
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
keep it at 36 so eight is eight is going
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
to stay at 36 thank you but seven is
 
01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639 align:start position:0%
going to go with a 30 and is we is the
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
liquor is not going to be regulating
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
him no they're going to make some
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations so on any possible
 
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
legislation written recommendation
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
I think this goes back to the
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
conversation again when I talked about
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
lonia Pumpkin Fest and that sign we saw
 
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
out that's a legal THC sold here and
 
01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
that and letting and it was a hemp based
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
product and so how we regulate and how
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
we manage that give them Delta Delta 9
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
this Delta 8 Delta 9 which right now we
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
have uh uh a statute that bars it until
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
continuation there was some question
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
whether we would want to sell it in the
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
stores or not so that's why we needed to
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
have the time to figure that
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
out all right so moving on um we'll
 
01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
leave that at 36 months give you time to
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
regulate do if you make any
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations on line
 
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
25 um because we changed the definition
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
of a franchise cannabis retail outlet
 
01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:15.639 align:start position:0%
and a cannabis retail outlet I'm going
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
to ask to strike and can the second one
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
that says and cannabis retail store and
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just read a franchise cannabis
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
retail Outlet shall include because we
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
have the they reference each other in
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
definition so it's kind of a
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
duplicative um I have a note on small
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one or down on page 33
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
line 33 rather um whether or not I just
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
have a note this say possible penalty I
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess this is just regarding
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
the information material well this is
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
the handouts right so we want do we want
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
to include on a handout that's required
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
um for materials and this this is Sue
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about having signage
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
and that kind of stuff up is do we want
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
to make add that on that sign for the
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
risk of driving under the influence of
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis and the fact that doing so is
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
illegal you'll be subject to a fine of
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
right up to kind of language so that
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
people are aware of the severity and the
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
risk of that um but I would say Mr
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
chairman this would be one of the
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
instances where the Liquor Commission
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
could convene the committee to take up
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
the language of how they wanted the
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
posters put or what they wanted in the
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
store so we could certainly add that and
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to do it which we don't
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
okay um this is also discussing uh a
 
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
handout am I am I correct in reading
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
this was it saying handout uh we already
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
have us code has handouts that when you
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
get medications you know very specific
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
format easy to follow I would recommend
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
that that be looked at I will say for
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
the medical marijuana program the the
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
only thing that I have that's with it
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
not being in statute is that for the
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana program right now
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a lot of effective
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
handouts being given and there was
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
actually a bill to do that and the
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
people that fought against that the most
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
was Department of Health and Human
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
Services so and if I'm correct if I
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
understand this I don't even think that
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's a handout now so leaving it just
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
to a commission you know no offense but
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes unless it's in statute it
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't get done is that PO is the
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
poster ready yet I know there was a
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
poster that was supposed to be made yeah
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
like a oneye poster I think I think it
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
took about about two years is the poster
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
places okay so so again I I think what
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
we can add for language in here uh again
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
I think this is one of those things that
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
can fall underneath the advisory Council
 
01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
for for public health and law
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement to add his handout and have
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
input with the Liquor Commission on the
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
the making of his handout so we can add
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
under the duties of the uh commission
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
that they'll work with reviewing and
 
01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing the handouts out of the going
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
out so we have a public health and a law
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh input into that process
 
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
well all I'm saying is unless the
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
handout require IR ments are put in the
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
statute it probably won't get done
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
timely I think to that point if the
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
poster is not done yet which it doesn't
 
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
since no one can answer that with
 
01:27:34.189 --> 01:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
absolute certainty which makes me
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
believe it's not done yet that poster
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
should have been done two years ago so I
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
think putting it in there and I I'm
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
confident that won't be a
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
problem making a hand out it says that
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
it could be identical to what the poster
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
exist so so the only other comment
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
change I had in this area was uh on line
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
D I had a note about chronic cannabis
 
01:28:00.149 --> 01:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
use disorder including some sort of
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
language relative to that on on under
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
letter D TR I recognize um Pro uh
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
problematic usage of cannabis and how to
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
obtain appropriate treatment um and
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
again I just have a note says chronic
 
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder and including some
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
sort of language around that doctor so I
 
01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
think that we had just said how to
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
recognize cannabis use disorder and set
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
up problematic use of cannabis since
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
that's what the medical diagnosis would
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
be and how to obtain appropriate
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
treatment and
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
services so it'll read how to recognize
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
um cannabis use disorder and how to
 
01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
obtain appropriate services and
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
treatment if we can just backtrack in in
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
on page 17 so where the franchise cams
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
retail LM on line 28 it shall include
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
information handle designed by the
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
commission now it's in consultation with
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
the Department Department means DHHS so
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
I want to put in consultation with the
 
01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.910 align:start position:0%
I want to put in consultation with the
advisory

01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
committee I guess my my point is that
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the holdup still may still happen so do
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
we want to require the consultation with
 
01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.950 align:start position:0%
we want to require the consultation with
the

01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
department so I guess the question is
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
again if we're gonna if we're going to
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
establish an advisory committee I think
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
we should have one point of contact not
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
multiple points of contact so we're
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to go back if if if that language
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I think you're what L darl what line
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
were you looking at I'm looking at line
 
01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
29 on page 17 and that doesn't mean
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
there can't be consultation but
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
requiring it under statute I think might
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
be I think that's that's the point that
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
was kind of raised so actually it's 26
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
on your on on page 17 on the print out
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
where it says informational handout
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
designed by the Commission in
 
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
consultation with the department and in
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
this case the department means DHS the
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
question is do we want to change that to
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
the advisory Council yeah don't we want
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
to remove DHHS completely completely and
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
and get stuff done immediately so let's
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
change it does everybody think it should
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
be the advisory Council the Cannabis
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
advisory Council that's being
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
created yes
 
01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
no I I will add to that that uh
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
according to that handout that I was
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
referring to it was the therapeutic
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis oversight medical oversight
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
board was not on board with doing this
 
01:30:16.510 --> 01:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
handout either so I'm just letting you
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
know we're we're requiring it so I think
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
we're okay there right we're saying
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
they'll make it available a design one
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
the only question is who has input into
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
what that handout looks like at this
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
point do we want it to be liquor and
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS or do we want it to be liquor and
 
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
the new Advisory board that we're
 
01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
creating the Cannabis Advisory Board
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's the question I think right now
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're sitting around okay and no handout
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
they can't sell so they I'm sure so
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
let's go Frank and then doctor I mean I
 
01:30:41.629 --> 01:30:41.639 align:start position:0%
think it makes I mean it defer to you
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it makes sense to have it as
 
01:30:45.550 --> 01:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
The Advisory board with the commission
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
and I just um can we Circle back who is
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
on The Advisory Board again we'll we'll
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
work that out but there public Health
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
officials law enforcement and Department
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
of Health and Services I have a comment
 
01:31:00.430 --> 01:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't um the ATC the HHS already have
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
an Advisory
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
Board don't you already have an Advisory
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
board so if they already have the
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board then I just say take this
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
away from The Liquor Commission this is
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
the atcs are the ones whove got the high
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
potency product they should get this
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
poster made and they can use their their
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and get it done and I
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't think they won make poster was
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
should have been made two years ago we
 
01:31:27.910 --> 01:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
can we can write in the statute right
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
here that the HHS has to get it done
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
they have to approve it get the
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
consultation get it done we back up one
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
second guys so I'm not going to go
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
backwards in history I'm going to go
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
forwards in history right so let's look
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
at what we're going to do not what what
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we had in the past right and so
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
again the question becomes if we're
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
taking away the
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
management again if you're an ATC you're
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
going to stay with DHHS and that
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board applies and you go do the
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
ATC thing but if you're going to be a
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
retail store and you're going to then I
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
think we need the regulatory stuff to
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
stay with Department of Health and Human
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
Services and we establish a cannabis
 
01:32:01.629 --> 01:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
advisory commission underneath health
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
and underneath liquor and let them work
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
with liquor for the purposes of this
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
handout I think that's the easiest way
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
rather than go between departments
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
because we've taken away the regulatory
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
control of a store if an ATC chooses to
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
become a for-profit retail store that
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
sells both therapeutic and and Retail
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
product um we've taken away that the
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
regulat oversight of that building or
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
that facility and put it in the hands of
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
liquor so I I my recommendation is to
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
just in consultation with the Cannabis
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and we'll figure out what
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
that board again that's the last item
 
01:32:36.669 --> 01:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back to is going to
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
say board or
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
commission whatever either Miss
 
01:32:44.030 --> 01:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
commission cannabis advisory
 
01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.950 align:start position:0%
commission cannabis advisory
commission

01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
CAC this is the public health advisory
 
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
committee yeah Public Health advisory
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee which we we agreed upon
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
creating yep then you know we'll deal
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
with that at the end but I'm just saying
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
that I just think Mr creation have been
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
on vacation when he creation of hand out
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
we want to leave in Liquor's hands not
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
have two different agencies going back
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
and forth trying to figure out what it
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
looks like and we we established a
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
commission that includes Public Health
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
officials and law enforcement to help
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
B sorry my daughter's going I do say you
 
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
better take that no I just silenced it
 
01:33:22.109 --> 01:33:22.119 align:start position:0%
she she's used to that
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
18 catch up here go back where we were
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
um any
 
01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:39.669 align:start position:0%
um any
[Music]

01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
other so I had a note that on um
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
line hold on on line 35 of on page
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
18 I had a note um
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
that um the Del up to two hours was a a
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
we agreed to strike
 
01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
that and just say um caution when eaten
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
or swallow the toxic effects of this
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
product may be delayed and not put a
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
timeline in there it's always striking
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh up to two hours maybe
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
delayed yes yep
 
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.830 align:start position:0%
delayed yes yep
okay

01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
y 18 here on the
 
01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.229 align:start position:0%
y 18 here on the
caution

01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
caution
 
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
um on the top of
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
19 on a FR okay so we're moving on to uh
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
318 F9 um franchise fee imposed yeah so
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
we were talking about the total gross
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
revenue and I had something about oh
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
right because we were talking about
 
01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
minus accessories and paraphernalia we
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
didn't want to
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
impose so I think again the discussion
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
Point here was around cannabis
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
accessories because we have stores that
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
currently are not licensed facilities
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
that sell cannabis accessories and we
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
Define what a cannabis accessory is so
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
the question is if we're charging a
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
retail store if a if a licensed retail
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
store marijuana retail store cannabis
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
retail store is selling accessories
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
should that be taxed or not taxed to
 
01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
non-licensed I did yeah
 
01:35:26.109 --> 01:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
um chair do we think we should exclude
 
01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:32.669 align:start position:0%
um chair do we think we should exclude
can

01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
accessories two just one quick thing on
 
01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
line four we're going to just strike the
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
word tax we have the word tax in good
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so that will be fee right and our
 
01:35:48.270 --> 01:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
discussion on our discussion on that was
 
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
in order to make it in order to make it
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
fair we have to do what one way or the
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
other not tax the franchisees or tax the
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
people that are selling it now
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
so so's what's the consensus the
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
consensus is just to strike the tax
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
component of the um accessories in all
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
instances whether it's a licensed retail
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
store or or a gen General retail store
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's the right in okay don't have
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
tax so will sounds like that's a
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
consensus of the committee so we'll add
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
in here a language that just says that
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis um accessories and Par yeah
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
grow it'll be basically a franchise fee
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
on a monthly gross total less the sale
 
01:36:39.390 --> 01:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
accessories yeah
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
excluding the sale of cannabis I I just
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
have to add for the record that this is
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
just word play what's that it's a tax
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
this is just word play yeah I
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
understand so again so it'll say a
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
franchise fee on the month a franchise
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
fee on the monthly total gross revenue
 
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
excluding the sale of cannabis
 
01:37:07.149 --> 01:37:07.159 align:start position:0%
accessories deriv from this or you could
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
say uh actually the way it's worded it's
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
not bad a franchise fee on the monthly
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
total gross revenue derived from the
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
sale of cannabis and cannabis products
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
but not on the sale it's just another
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
way to do it sure we'll put it right
 
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:21.750 align:start position:0%
way to do it sure we'll put it right
there

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
excluding yeah yeah so right after the
 
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
word cannabis products we just want to
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
add excluding the sale of cannabis
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
accessories by the franchise is
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
everybody good with
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
that moving on um just know that there's
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
a couple places here where we again have
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
the we have two different definitions of
 
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
retail store and the language and I'm
 
01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
just Daryl's going through and just
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
striking that second reference all at
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
every place that's found um so in in
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
this line on the draft page on page 19
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
we have the same thing franch franchise
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
retail franchise cannabis retail outlet
 
01:37:56.669 --> 01:37:56.679 align:start position:0%
and cannabis retail store we're just
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
striking in cannabis retail store
 
01:37:59.589 --> 01:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
everywhere we find it where we're
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
defining them both yep um all right
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
where were we
 
01:38:06.719 --> 01:38:08.390 align:start position:0%
where were we
19

01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
19
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
um no
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
May chair one couple of quick changes on
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom if on 318 F12 line
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
31 the commission shall require all C us
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
establishments to utilize we'd like the
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
word put in an electronic inventory
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
tracking system so everybody does it the
 
01:38:32.910 --> 01:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
same our inventory is one way that makes
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
sense and then on line
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
35 um and the sale of cannabis and
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis products from seedling to sale
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
shall enable separation of tracking that
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:52.109 align:start position:0%
 
end

01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
okay so again so we're going to that
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
sentence will read starting on line 34
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
the system shall ensure an accurate
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
accounting of the pro of the production
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
processing and sale of cannabis and
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis products from seedling to sale
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
and shall enable yep correct thank
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
you I have a question yes on the trans
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
transferring of
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis um between cannabis
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
establishments how will law enforcement
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
that stops a truck of marijuana know
 
01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.629 align:start position:0%
that stops a truck of marijuana know
it's

01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
tracked it's a legal grow quote unquote
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
or an illegal
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
grow with the electronic tracking will
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
law enforcement have access to that
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
tracking I wouldn't see why not I I
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't think that that would be a problem
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think it would be anyone that anyone
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
within the law enforcement agencies that
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to see that tracking would have
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
the availability to see it our our folks
 
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
would certainly have it and able to
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
share it with anybody that would be 247
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you yeah Mr Malik I
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
also I assume that the licing component
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
of this there'll be some sort of card
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
right or some sort of placard some sort
 
01:40:04.589 --> 01:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
of something they have to have if
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're if they're acting as
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
transporting the product between
 
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
cultivator the manufacturer manufacturer
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
to distribution distribution to um
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
retail to store all anybody who's doing
 
01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
that activity will have some sort of
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
card or some sort of way of proving I'm
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
I'm like to do this much like when you
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
go into a restaurant today there's a
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
requirement of a license on the wall
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
That's signed by the commission that
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
would have to be at the establishment
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
where the product was cultivated
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
manufactured and in those vehicles that
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
was that were transporting it so in
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
theory the driver will have some sort
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
of so all right um all right so 13 is
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
where we start talking about enactment
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
Clauses and there were some changes in
 
01:40:50.239 --> 01:40:51.870 align:start position:0%
Clauses and there were some changes in
here

01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
um so the first change is on line two
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
and just say at the banial election we
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
got rid of the held in November of 24 we
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
didn't want dates on
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
there um the next change was the second
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
half of the sentence um and getting rid
 
01:41:12.109 --> 01:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
of where it says shall we allow the
 
01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:13.719 align:start position:0%
operation of count establishment within
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
our city or town and then we struck the
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
whole second question from the word and
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
all the way through to to um city or
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
town is that
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
everybody remembering that the same way
 
01:41:29.719 --> 01:41:32.510 align:start position:0%
everybody remembering that the same way
I

01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
am I wasn't here I wasn't here for that
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
so take
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
word so um we had another strike out
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
here is if the majority of the qualified
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
voters present in voting in the
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
municipal signal their approval for
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
operation of a count of establishment
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
then the Cannabis establishment may
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
start I had struck all that because I
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
think it
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
was duplicative once they've approved it
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
there's no date that's
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
necessary but I had that I had that
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
whole thing all the way to July 1 of 25
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
struck on my copy that we agreed to
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
well okay and then we left the rest of
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
the provision
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
alone so there are significant changes
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
is on
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
14 yeah so we're also just striking all
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
the way to Jo from from there all the
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
way to
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
here um all right
 
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:40.350 align:start position:0%
here um all right
14

01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
um so again I as I read
 
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.990 align:start position:0%
um so again I as I read
this

01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
um no casile shop
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
operate um we had we had a second I
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
wrote 171 col1 for some reason insert
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't know what that was so I
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
remember so Senator abbis did you just
 
01:43:01.589 --> 01:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
make these changes on your own were
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
there was this agreed on by the
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
commission well are you talking about R
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
numeral two 14 no for we're starting on
 
01:43:12.030 --> 01:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
line uh 29 that's ran numeral one
 
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
section F14 uh one has talking about
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
distances where you can operate a
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis related product location that
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
was not discussed I'm I'm sure come up
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
today so in consultation with many of
 
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
the people that have been reviewing this
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
my understanding this language is a will
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
be needed to get it over the finish
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh well here I'm not saying that I it's
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
it's my first choice I think 2000 ft was
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
I was okay with that but when I say that
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
this may hit a road
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
block it might not make it over the
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
Finish Line well I mean I that may be
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
true but this commission is making
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations about what the
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
commission thought was appropriate you
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
know there will be
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
political uh conversations which is why
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know Senator Lang had suggested at
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
the very beginning that folks will
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
provide comments but I don't I don't
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a change in policy
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
that this commission didn't
 
01:44:12.910 --> 01:44:12.920 align:start position:0%
discuss I thought we had talked about
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
putting it on in par with liquor I think
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
it was 250 ft right so I just looked up
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
the RS right so I remember why I wrote
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
insert 71 uh 177 colon one and it talks
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
about the state liquor stores it says
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
the commission may lease purchase and
 
01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
equip in the name of the state such
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
store state-owned Warehouse warehouses
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
supplies as defined in blah blah blah
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
and other material goods and services
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
are necessary for incidental to or
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
related to the operation of Liquor
 
01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
Commission retail and wholesale
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
operators the commission may lease in
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
the name of the state space for State
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
stores for the purpose of installing an
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
automatic teling machines no newly
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
estblished established state store shall
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
operate within 200 ft of any public or
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
private school church chapel or Parish
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
house so I think we were talking about
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
adding that language about 200 feet in
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
here so it's consist so state liquor
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
stores and State marijuana stores are
 
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
are on par um and then have the fight
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
out you know again call that out as a
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
area of discussion for the policy
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee to have and I understand
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
Daryl's point that this may be a
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
roadblock for some people um you know if
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's not at least as big or or small
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
um I I would say that if we're going to
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
establish a new standard beyond what we
 
01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
use already for liquor stores then that
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
should be a separate policy discussion
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
by the policy committee so let's go to
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
let's hold on let's go to we're gonna go
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
to Dave then Tim and the chief we're so
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
we're tasked with doing with coming up
 
01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
with recommendations that we feel would
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
be the safest and the most efficient in
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
all those things for the State of New
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I don't think 200 feet for
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
a selling marijuana really protects a
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
school with a high school you have a
 
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
high school 200 feet away it's you you
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
walk out the front door you walk a block
 
01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
you're right there and talking about an
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
enticement every time kids walk by it to
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
go to school so I I think it is
 
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to to have it um and I think
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
it makes sense where where it says uh
 
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
you know a half a mile with 50 thou a
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
mile with less than 50,000 residents and
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
a half mile with um for over that
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
because it because it would make it
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense because with uh you know you
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
have cities you you lodger like take
 
01:46:33.070 --> 01:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester for instance you have at
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
least I think it's down to 12 but you
 
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
have 12 elementary schools you have you
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
have the uh junior high schools and then
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
you have four high schools so I think
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
that half a
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
mile you know makes a makes a uh makes a
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
provision to to at least allow it if
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester decides to do that so Tim you
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
know I just want to say you know we
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
we've pretty much removed every other
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
guideline protecting the kids for the
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
most part this this commission should
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
not make it 250 feet that's that's CL
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's clown
 
01:47:11.470 --> 01:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
like I'm not not either way I'm I'm just
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
saying with the existing laws for state
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
schools and we have the same protections
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
of beer for alcohol right we only kids
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
drinking beer 16 year olds so that's why
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
we set a 200 foot limit but now now
 
01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:21.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to change it and create an
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
increased limit for other specific
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
product that's all I'm I'm talking about
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
consistency in in messaging Chief I will
 
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
say that the Chiefs are in favor of the
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
one mile but with that being said if
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at the
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
alcohol um limits why are we bringing it
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
down to preschool Elementary and
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
secondary let's just say schools so it
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
includes colleges we've heard testimony
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
that up to age 25 it's going to affect
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
your brain development
 
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
why are we going to allow
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
colleges well again under under the C
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
under the current 1771 it doesn't
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
specify it says schools it just says
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
schools period which would include
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
College I agree so again so we went to
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
the 1771 language it's um shall be no no
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
no estate store shall be operated within
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
200 feet of any public private school
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
church chapel or Parish house would be
 
01:48:18.430 --> 01:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
the language the question is whether we
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
agree with that and we can argue about
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
the distance if we want um or we can use
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
the distance as an addendum note um make
 
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
it consistent with current law and then
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
have it as an addendum note of policy
 
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee needs to discuss how far away
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is so um let's do Frank and then
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
sue uh thank you I think that makes
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
sense to have it you know on par with
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
existing law um I think one other thing
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
this is more of a question do we know
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
what it currently exists with regard to
 
01:48:49.709 --> 01:48:49.719 align:start position:0%
atc's and any distance requirements from
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
schools others ask somebody in the
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
audience that might know maybe Mike you
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
might know do we have a distance
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
requirement for ATC to be away from
 
01:48:58.159 --> 01:49:18.629 align:start position:0%
requirement for ATC to be away from
schools

01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
churches in the report that we put out
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
we can put that the the policy issues
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
are not agreed upon by you know that's
 
01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
support if you're a yes vote on the on
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
the report but it doesn't mean you
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
support all the policies like this so
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be I I just want to add in we're
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
trying to make this equivalency to the
 
01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
liquor laws but the reality is this is a
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
federally illegal drug and liquor is not
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
a federally illegal substance so we
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
really we really I think that that
 
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
actually justifies having two sets of
 
01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
actually justifies having two sets of
stand

01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
stand
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
so would would the argu would we agree
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
that if we oh sorry Tim go ahhe you know
 
01:49:58.709 --> 01:49:58.719 align:start position:0%
he brings up a great point over here F
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
finally I agree with Frank we should
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
follow the existing law and follow the
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
existing law of at least a thousand feet
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
so I I'm okay with that that's just
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
where I was going to go so we okay with
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
making the limit equal to what is the
 
01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
current limit under the thcs I can I
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
just explain one
 
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
thing if there's certain things I'm
 
01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
aware I'm aware of that are deal
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
breakers and certain things that are not
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
I if this language is I'm just telling
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
you it's not it's part it's part of a
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
compromise and if we're going to
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
compromise there's a lot of people
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
compromising in different directions
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
here this is one of them I'm not saying
 
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's it turns out to be problematic it's
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
one of those things that a future
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
legislator could always John then David
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
okay as someone who sits on a policy
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
committee I think a thousand is the
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
right answer okay thank you CH I I think
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
we we we had a great deal discussion on
 
01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:50.750 align:start position:0%
we we we had a great deal discussion on
M

01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
M
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
to to young people and how we have to uh
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
we have to really do our best to make
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
sure that doesn't happen but by allowing
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
even a thousand feet I believe
 
01:51:02.109 --> 01:51:02.119 align:start position:0%
especially at a high school I think
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
that's the best marketing you could ever
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
have for a marijuana shop where kids
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
have to go byy it and they see the signs
 
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the whatever in the in the windows
 
01:51:14.669 --> 01:51:14.679 align:start position:0%
and I've never seen a uh I've never seen
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
a Liquor Commission I mean a a liquor
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
outlet Maybe I'm Wrong uh they were
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
school before
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
so again we already
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
allow U therapeutic cannabis atc's
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
within a th000 feet that's the current
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
law um so my my recommendation and if
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
the committee will go along with that is
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
to use that same footage so we're not
 
01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
setting a brand new standard for a
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
different type of uh function and then
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
let anybody who has an objection to the
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
thousand feet can write an addendum that
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
Daryl can add to the report that'll say
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
um this this foot limit was not uh
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
recommended I don't think we need to do
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
it because we'll have a million of those
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
this report's going be will'll be 2,000
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
Pages I'm just telling you you change
 
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
this the whole the whole thing sen Lang
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
how many how many atcs are there in the
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire seven right so
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
what we're really talking about is we're
 
01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
actually talking about a whole crud ton
 
01:52:11.069 --> 01:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
of pot shops popping up which is not the
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
same thing as 4,000 feet around four
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
atc's so I I I think that using the ATC
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
standard is willfully inadequate for the
 
01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
volume of of stores that are going to be
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
trying to establish themselves in the
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
state under the franchise let's do this
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
let's Dave did did I get to you I
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
apologize your mic was still on okay all
 
01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
those in favor of using the ATC standard
 
01:52:39.149 --> 01:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
to move forward raise your
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
hand all those want to use the liquor
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
standard raise your
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
hand all those that want to use the
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
what's written in here raise your
 
01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.870 align:start position:0%
what's written in here raise your
hand

01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right so looks like the
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
consensus is we'll leave the language as
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
it is um and then anybody who wants to
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
write an theendum can write in theendum
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
to the bill uh as a as a as a call out
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
note for the policy committee can we
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
change it to schools versus preschools
 
01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.709 align:start position:0%
change it to schools versus preschools
elementaries

01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
elementaries
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
Etc so do you want to use the question
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
is and again I I so we're going to be a
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of parody do you want to use
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
the language that's in
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
1771 which is um um so we would change
 
01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
of any public private school church
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
chapel or Parish house
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes would would that include a preschool
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
yes public school thank you oh no well
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
yeah private not all preschools are
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
private what about the I'm sorry just
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the LI the we're only
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
talking about for municipalities with
 
01:53:52.069 --> 01:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
less Le than 50,000 residents and then
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
half mile for municipalities with more
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
resents so I understand that would apply
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
to cities like Manchester rash it's more
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
condensed so we to leave existing
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
language we're just going to change that
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
to include the language from
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
1771 on what type of facilities you have
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
to be a distance from um to make it more
 
01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
inclusive so if you add those those
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
other uh give the institution I'm not
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
saying it's a bad idea in general but
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
the the one mile or an half mile is
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration only schools so
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
if you add other things to that you may
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
cancel out everything so I don't know I
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
don't know that's are
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
intent well that's why I wouldn't add
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
everything I would just leave schools
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
because I think that's all right what
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
that distance was let's do again so the
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
question is do we want to leave it we're
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
going to have two different stances
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
we'll take a quick vote on by the
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee the first stance is to leave
 
01:54:52.270 --> 01:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
the language that is currently in there
 
01:54:53.950 --> 01:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
it says pre-existing public or private
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
preschool Elementary or secondary school
 
01:54:58.510 --> 01:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
and municipalities or do we change it to
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
say um instead of that provision
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
preschool that that says instead any
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
public or private school church chapel
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
or Parish house so everyone's in favor
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the existing language raise your
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
hand everybody wants to use the liquor
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
store model that includes public private
 
01:55:20.189 --> 01:55:20.199 align:start position:0%
schools churches
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
hand there's a lot of churches that have
 
01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:28.719 align:start position:0%
schools in them so so again so it looks
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
like we're going to use the liquor
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
language to for the loc for the
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
definition of what product properties
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
are subject to the foot the restriction
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
on distance what's the RSA so I can
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
reference 177 one it's right here here's
 
01:55:40.679 --> 01:55:41.830 align:start position:0%
reference 177 one it's right here here's
the

01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
language also we're adding striking the
 
01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
any public private school church chapel
 
01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
or Parish house all right moving on 177
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
col one
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
one uh 318
 
01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:59.430 align:start position:0%
one uh 318
F15

01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
um only thing I had was in here we were
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
adding the word license throughout the
 
01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:08.679 align:start position:0%
entire thing so it said um from a
 
01:56:10.669 --> 01:56:10.679 align:start position:0%
licensed cannabis cultivation facility
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
delivering a transfer a licensed
 
01:56:14.069 --> 01:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis so everywhere where we're
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
talking about a facility we want to make
 
01:56:16.629 --> 01:56:16.639 align:start position:0%
it absolutely clear we're talking about
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
licensed product licensed
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.950 align:start position:0%
licensed product licensed
locations

01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's through the whole section right so
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
it's one a anywhere it says like a
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
is all right
 
01:56:44.109 --> 01:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
um can you uh can you just give
 
01:56:46.910 --> 01:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
me on uh page 20 is there a reason for
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
the double negative on uh section 15 why
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
does it say following act shall not be
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
illegal why not just say following act
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
shall be legal I mean it it's almost
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
like it's I just wondered if there's a
 
01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
way yeah not be illegal means it's legal
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
so you can just say shall be legal be
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
legal like double double you okay with
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
that you know it's a little conv instead
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
of not be illegal just say shall be
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
legal shall be legal bear with
 
01:57:26.350 --> 01:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
15 be instead of saying shall not shall
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
not be illegal just say shall be
 
01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:35.290 align:start position:0%
illegal word not all
 
01:57:35.290 --> 01:57:40.229 align:start position:0%
illegal word not all
[Music]

01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.239 --> 01:57:42.669 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:57:42.669 --> 01:57:42.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.189 align:start position:0%
 
22

01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
22
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
22 I had here that
 
01:57:59.069 --> 01:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
um the Chiefs we're going to come back
 
01:58:03.069 --> 01:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
um so talking about we're under
 
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
F16 proof of purchases
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
identity was there anything here we need
 
01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.310 align:start position:0%
identity was there anything here we need
to

01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:21.069 --> 01:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
change Chief I had that the we just
 
01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:31.639 align:start position:0%
consistent I just had some note that
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
said liquor license and I remember what
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
what we were saying at the top under the
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
title I think we were just trying to
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
make it equivalent to alcohol and so
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're just yeah I think you need um I
 
01:58:44.189 --> 01:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
need to say can not just sale of
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis cannabis and cannabis products
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:05.709 --> 01:59:05.719 align:start position:0%
accessories anything else under proof of
 
01:59:05.719 --> 01:59:12.550 align:start position:0%
accessories anything else under proof of
ID

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.790 --> 01:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
17 um I think we had pretty good
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
discussion on this relative to sting
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
operations versus normal
 
01:59:25.639 --> 01:59:27.510 align:start position:0%
operations versus normal
enforcement

01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
um and it's a violation in sting
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
operation nor it's a misdemeanor in
 
01:59:32.199 --> 01:59:33.270 align:start position:0%
operation nor it's a misdemeanor in
normal

01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
normal
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement and again this is a
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
violation to the licensed against the
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
licensed operator who misdemeanor
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
against a licensed operator not the
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
individual is there a difference in
 
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
definition it says cannabis
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia versus canab this
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
accessory I know you know they could be
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
more than that I think parap little
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
broader but we need to
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
put accessories under
 
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.149 align:start position:0%
put accessories under
8-f

02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.910 --> 02:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
117 so cannabis accessories and cannabis
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia are defined on page three
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 3 so we have a pretty good
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%
definition yeah but it doesn't include
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
accessories um
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
318 d F 17 I'm just going to add
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessories
 
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
paraph paraphernalia is there which I
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
think includes accessories but I would
 
02:00:30.589 --> 02:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
are you talking about 16 or
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
17 17 and my Lin oh you just want to add
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
you just want to say cannabis cannabis
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
products cannabis accessories or can
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis paraphernalia okay everybody
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
parhelia same it's in the same it's one
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
definitions

02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
all right um in on on ran numeral 2 line
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
26 um I had an addition on here that
 
02:01:09.629 --> 02:01:09.639 align:start position:0%
says except as allow permitted by RSA
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
126x I had the same right so this is
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
people under the age of 21 who have a
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
medical card um are allowed they are not
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to be subject to that
 
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
where where are you right now Roman new
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh line on the new bill line 28 right
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
here nothing is trapped shall to
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
transfer blah BL someone under 21 except
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
as provided for so right under under
 
02:01:34.109 --> 02:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
this section right here at the end of
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
there um we just say we need to add
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
except as provided for by RSA 126x
 
02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:48.030 align:start position:0%

02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:55.750 align:start position:0%
 
126x

02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
page

02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:02:04.830 --> 02:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
um if I could I just want to make sure I
 
02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
understand I'm reading correctly on
 
02:02:10.589 --> 02:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
37 uh what what page or what line 23
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
page 23 line 37 it looks like uh in the
 
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
case of the rental or residential
 
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
dwelling a landlord shall not prohibit
 
02:02:18.990 --> 02:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
the possession of cannabis or the
 
02:02:21.149 --> 02:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
consumption of cannabis by non-smoking
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
means unless never I'll just keep
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
reading I think I'm just getting stuck
 
02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
reading I think I'm just getting stuck
on

02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
that so again it it allows for a
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
landlord to still prohibit smoking but
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
not prohibit consumption by any other
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
means so you you can they can prohibit
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
smoking and vaping but they can't stop
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
first we want to leave that in there
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
it's over
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
tacking it's yeah one of those things
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
where if you're using Edibles your
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
landlord to the point that your landlord
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
finds out you're I'm not really sure
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
doing land might also say you can't
 
02:03:06.079 --> 02:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
doing land might also say you can't
drink

02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
in I think the difference between
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
smoking and vaping is the residue right
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
so you don't if I take an edible I'm not
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
going to get residue all over my walls
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
you ever walked on someone's apartment
 
02:03:22.149 --> 02:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
that smokes right so again I think the
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
landlord has a right to limit the damage
 
02:03:25.390 --> 02:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
to their existing property I mean you
 
02:03:27.510 --> 02:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
can limit whether someone has
 
02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
pets why don't we strike this landlord
 
02:03:33.950 --> 02:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
section why I'd like to strike it seems
 
02:03:37.750 --> 02:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
like a odd to legislate that seems
 
02:03:39.830 --> 02:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
odd what I
 
02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
would recommend so you want to
 
02:03:43.559 --> 02:03:45.470 align:start position:0%
would recommend so you want to
strike

02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
strike
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
um all
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:52.030 align:start position:0%
um all
of

02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
really

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
all yeah if if there's not something in
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
statute that actually allows the
 
02:04:05.109 --> 02:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
landlord to say whether or not they want
 
02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
to prevent cannabis smoking on their
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
property then does that open them up to
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
liability of getting sued for
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
discrimination I think you can put it in
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
your lease you put it in your lease just
 
02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
like you know pets
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
some right but could somebody challenge
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
that legally saying well there's no you
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
know there's it's a discrimination
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
against Canabis smokers that's not a
 
02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:29.870 align:start position:0%
against Canabis smokers that's not a
protected

02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:31.510 align:start position:0%
protected
class

02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
class
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
like L could say no alcohol in my could
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
they put that in their lease I mean the
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
only the only place I know where they
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
can do that is if it's like a sober
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
living facility but absent that I'm not
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
I mean this is I don't know I'd have to
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
look I'm not familiar with that it's
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's contract it's a lease is a contract
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
you you put in there what you if you
 
02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
don't want your attendant having a large
 
02:04:57.149 --> 02:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
dog or a dog over a certain weight or
 
02:05:00.510 --> 02:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
any dog at all you put it in there m Mr
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
J but I'm just saying this is a kind of
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
like an awkward regulation of the
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
landlord I just it doesn't need to be in
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
there by any means especially in what
 
02:05:11.229 --> 02:05:11.239 align:start position:0%
the charge of the commission is I I
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
would strike it
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
um so are we talking about striking just
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.350 --> 02:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.069 --> 02:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
chair all right so you wanted to strike
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
letter A all of letter
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
one Sue and then Tim well I would just
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
say that this we're not really talking
 
02:05:54.589 --> 02:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
about a dog or or some something that's
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
already a known factor for landlords I I
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
do believe since this is sort of a new
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
territory for a lot of people landlords
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
might need a little bit of that top top
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
cover and
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
statute and and and I also agree because
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
in our last house session we heard
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
people testifying on the house floor
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
that their religion was doing drugs this
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
was part of their religion so that's a
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
protected class um so the you can go
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
watch the tapes we had Representatives
 
02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
testifying to that so it it doesn't
 
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
listen it doesn't we we have to protect
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
we have to protect the landord slow down
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
so if we strike um a and leave B right B
 
02:06:37.149 --> 02:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
still says this chapter shall not
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
prevent a landlord from prohibiting
 
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis smoking or cannabis
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
cultivation um I don't know we need
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
cultivation because cultivation is now a
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
licensed function so it can't they can't
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
they can't allow it anyway um but um are
 
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
we okay if we choose to strike a just
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.599 --> 02:07:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
C

02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
C
 
02:07:07.390 --> 02:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
yes all those in favor of striking a um
 
02:07:11.470 --> 02:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
hand all right so we'll we'll strike a
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and then B becomes a
 
02:07:26.189 --> 02:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
B all right we good on that section
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.510 --> 02:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
contracts I have no notes on this it was
 
02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
accepted by
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
everybody this next one will be a
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation regarding
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
licensure part of me feels we should
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
just strike the entire thing you're
 
02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
talking about nondiscrimination the
 
02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:49.750 align:start position:0%
talking about nondiscrimination the
non-discrimination

02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination
 
02:07:52.109 --> 02:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
um activities and prior convictions part
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
of me wants to strike the whole thing
 
02:07:56.109 --> 02:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
we're walking into a giant Minefield of
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
licenses and and professional licenses
 
02:08:01.709 --> 02:08:01.719 align:start position:0%
and state licenses Federal licenses and
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you know we
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
should I agree
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
comments Chief my thought is if we chose
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
or choose at this point to ignore it
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're setting up so many agencies for
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
failure it it's just not right I think
 
02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
that you have to address this with the
 
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
lers school bus drivers police officers
 
02:08:26.589 --> 02:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
people carrying weapons security
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
guards there's limits there's Federal
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
limits and I think that you have to look
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
at those and address them now versus
 
02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
down the road when it
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
happens right Senator Whitley yeah I
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
just I didn't know if the Attorney
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
General had any comments that we had
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
sort of asked him to touch base yep
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely now thank you for that so
 
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
brought it back we spoke internally
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
about these Provisions outside of my
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
area of expertise I don't have any
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
recommended language at this point just
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
given the complexities of this issue uh
 
02:08:59.709 --> 02:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
may be appropriate for a placeholder
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
just as was discussed earlier given all
 
02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
of the uh the considerations at play
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
here what I can tell you in this is more
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
in the legal world as for attorneys
 
02:09:14.589 --> 02:09:14.599 align:start position:0%
ethical rules you know when when states
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
have started to allow Recreation or
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot we ran to dilemma like we're not
 
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:21.320 align:start position:0%
as a lawyer we can't Advocate or give
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
someone advice to violate the law when
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict between state and
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
federal what do we do and the recommend
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
the guidelines from you know most of the
 
02:09:32.189 --> 02:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
uh the um State bars what they came out
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
with basically if you would advise them
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
to comply with state law you know you
 
02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:38.280 align:start position:0%
just have to advise them in part of the
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
process you are violating federal law
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
which is pretty easy to do but for here
 
02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
this has to do with whether you know
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to impact professional
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
licenses or not or occupations are we
 
02:09:51.149 --> 02:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
going to deal with that at the state
 
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
level um I
 
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
think you know I understand some federal
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
laws like if you have a CDL this could
 
02:09:59.310 --> 02:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
be a
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
problematic but are we are we going to
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
tackle that right now with this this
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
commission so let let's go to Tim and
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
then PR you know I just have a question
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues and everybody sitting
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
out there and everybody at home U raise
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
your hand if you actually want your
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
kids's school bus driver being allowed
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
to get high while they're driving your
 
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:18.990 align:start position:0%
to get high while they're driving your
kids

02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
kids
 
02:10:20.430 --> 02:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
and I think the answer should be no for
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
every single one of you and we should
 
02:10:24.510 --> 02:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
regulate that yeah but I think just
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
that's up to the employer on to Frank de
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
Frank um I I think this section is
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
important I think we heard from
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning that there has to
 
02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
be a NE I mean it's important to have
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
some requirement that there's a Nexus
 
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
between the denial of lure and the the
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
action that the person engaged in so in
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
this case smoking marijuana or using
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana I think section 10 or part 10
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
unlik line 30 on page 26 gives clear uh
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
ability of uh employers to um uh Pro uh
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
to punish or to discipline individuals
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
who engage in uh actions that are either
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
negligence or um forget the term we used
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
not malpractice but um there's a new
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
term I think that was circulated this
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
morning obviously operating a vehicle is
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited under DUI laws but also
 
02:11:18.870 --> 02:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
clearly here operating and be on 36 is
 
02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
also prohibited um so I don't think
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
that's um I think that concern is
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in many other places um I do
 
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important that practically
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
speaking people use marijuana and it's
 
02:11:33.189 --> 02:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
important not to deny lure uh for
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
something when there's no clear Nexus to
 
02:11:37.390 --> 02:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
their use of marijuana and their ability
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
to conduct their employment I will say
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
in lines 8 n of page 25 Pride conviction
 
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
for a nonviolent can cannabis offense it
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
does not involve distribution to minors
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we could probably that doesn't
 
02:11:54.549 --> 02:11:54.559 align:start position:0%
really eliminate the drug kingpin shall
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
we say but so we can probably make that
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
stronger but
 
02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise I just leaving it in so here's
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
my concern is around section six of this
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
bill except as provided the section
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
neither the state nor any political
 
02:12:09.549 --> 02:12:09.559 align:start position:0%
subdivisions May discriminate against a
 
02:12:12.189 --> 02:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
person in hiring termination or any term
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
or condition of employment or otherwise
 
02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
penalize a person in employment or
 
02:12:18.109 --> 02:12:18.119 align:start position:0%
Contracting if the Discrimination is
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
based on any of the on either of the
 
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
following right so engaging a lawful
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
activity so smoking or consuming
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana right a prior conviction for
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
nonviolent offense which is fine right
 
02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with doing way with past
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
convictions but then the last one is
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
testing positive so again state trooper
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
police officer um fireman um anybody who
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
test positive by this the town can't
 
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
fire them if that's the only reason for
 
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
doing it they can't do a random blood
 
02:12:48.589 --> 02:12:48.599 align:start position:0%
test find out that they test positive
 
02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
and say you're
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
terminated that's problematic if that's
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment so how do we
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.229 --> 02:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
that because now we're talking about
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
State we're talking about Municipal and
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
County and state employees our
 
02:13:08.310 --> 02:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
correctional officers our again firemen
 
02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:10.549 align:start position:0%
correctional officers our again firemen
policemen

02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:10.559 align:start position:0%
policemen
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
um I think sen Whitley so I think in
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
this area I I agree that so I'm sort of
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of middle ground because I do
 
02:13:20.669 --> 02:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
agree that this is worthy of
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
conversation and incl in the overall
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
topic but I think it's complicated
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
enough that we're not going to solve it
 
02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
today so perhaps a note here that you
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
know the committee there is consensus
 
02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
around the need to have some
 
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
conversation about non-discrimination
 
02:13:37.629 --> 02:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
but you know essentially we ran out of
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
time to go through the details I was
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
just thinking instead of it says
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
distribution to miners just have it say
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
distribution I think that basically if
 
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
you were illegally I'm talking sort of
 
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
globally about this section about this
 
02:13:51.149 --> 02:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
whole section this non-discriminatory
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
for employment purposes which is what
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're all talking about in general and
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
there's some specific call outs here um
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
so I I that I have just have concerns I
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how to address them again
 
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
like law enforcement fire my my concern
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
is that those kind of you know um people
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
who are subject to drug testing are
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
state employees and test
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
positive right why I guess my question
 
02:14:16.950 --> 02:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
is are are State Police are state
 
02:14:19.229 --> 02:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
employees drug tested anywhere in this
 
02:14:19.239 --> 02:14:20.149 align:start position:0%
employees drug tested anywhere in this
are

02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
they we're talking here about employment
 
02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
and hiring right so again I know in
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
hiring that's not an uncommon practice
 
02:14:28.510 --> 02:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
again I got I got tested by the New
 
02:14:31.910 --> 02:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Electric uh NHC just go work
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
in it was a requirement of testing right
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
so um and if I pop positive does that
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
mean they still have to give me the
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
job or would they be discriminate
 
02:14:43.310 --> 02:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
against me because I'm doing a legally
 
02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
function a legal subject so do I now
 
02:14:47.149 --> 02:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
have a case against them for
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination I don't think it's
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination because it's not a
 
02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
protected class everyone keeps you
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
throwing that word around discrimination
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
because it's in here may not
 
02:14:56.830 --> 02:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
discriminate I I know but it's it's
 
02:14:58.589 --> 02:14:58.599 align:start position:0%
using it out of context I mean
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination applies you know it's
 
02:15:03.549 --> 02:15:03.559 align:start position:0%
gender religion race Frank that type of
 
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
stuff um I I can do my home uh research
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
and get it back obviously not for
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
purposes of today but for the policy
 
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
debates this session I believe like just
 
02:15:13.629 --> 02:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
from band The Box work in the past I
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
think there are carve outs for certain
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh employment types like law enfor Etc
 
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
that have a different criteria um and
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
carve outs from uh some of these lure
 
02:15:25.229 --> 02:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
issues so we could get that to the
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
policy committees but if it would be you
 
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
know okay with everyone to kind of leave
 
02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:32.559 align:start position:0%
the concept in here understanding that I
 
02:15:35.549 --> 02:15:35.559 align:start position:0%
think as you mentioned Senator Lang perc
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the hang-up issue on
 
02:15:39.470 --> 02:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
Line 39 and we can get back to folks
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
with some ideas from other states is
 
02:15:43.629 --> 02:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
there any objection though with if you
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
go on page 25 lines it's 36 37 same
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
thing same page on lines 8 n to just
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
strike two minors and just have that say
 
02:16:00.669 --> 02:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
you I'm okay with
 
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
that so everybody okay so the idea is
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
just again any any possession with
 
02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
intent to sell that's that's you know on
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
your record is still valid doesn't have
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
to be just a minor it's any any
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to sell in case
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
conviction per
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
all right I'm sorry was there consensus
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
reached I'm sort of going back to the
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
entirety of the section I don't think
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
there is and like I I'm I would like to
 
02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
see I I don't know how to deal with um
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
section six which is my big concern
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
about Municipal towy you know and state
 
02:16:38.190 --> 02:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
government um
 
02:16:40.669 --> 02:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
employment you know concerns so we could
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
just I'm just saying for if you just
 
02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
globally we could instead of you know
 
02:16:47.669 --> 02:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
this is just a thought we could just say
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
globally for Section 20 for F20 that you
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
know there was consensus reached that
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
the conversation of about
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination is important in the
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
context of employment uh licensing Etc
 
02:17:02.309 --> 02:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
but we didn't have the capacity or the
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
time to get into the details just
 
02:17:06.589 --> 02:17:06.599 align:start position:0%
retaining the
 
02:17:08.709 --> 02:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
concept what we would need to do is just
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
put in the bill as a study committee to
 
02:17:15.549 --> 02:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
create to have a policy for next
 
02:17:18.830 --> 02:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
year that's the way we normally do it
 
02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
again so also remember that we have a
 
02:17:24.429 --> 02:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
30mon push out on this so there is more
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
time to deal with we could do a
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
commission you know separate bill for a
 
02:17:32.070 --> 02:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
commission on this topic and let them
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
delve into what the the detail is on
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
their license or public license we could
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
just strike the section in in its place
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
or we could leave it put the study
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee in this section huh you just
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
WR this section you just say no you want
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
to add the commission you add add the
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
study commission right now in in the
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
bill that it it it will T you know for
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
another year deadline for legislation
 
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
for for 20 26 so that would go after
 
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
section six well no I think he's going
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
to leave it as it's going to be actually
 
02:18:02.910 --> 02:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
F20 the whole of F20 will be we'll
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
establish commission the study and it's
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
everything that's in this section
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
therefore make it easier when they put
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
it in the statute right that make sense
 
02:18:12.429 --> 02:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
to everybody yes so again so the idea
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
being that instead of using prescriptive
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
dialogue in here what we're going to say
 
02:18:18.669 --> 02:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
is that the legislature will establish
 
02:18:20.349 --> 02:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
the study commission and there'll can
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
make up the study commission toy to
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
discuss um discrimination in state level
 
02:18:28.349 --> 02:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah blah and allow and
 
02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
it'll cover these topics and it's all
 
02:18:32.549 --> 02:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
the topics that's listed in 20 yep okay
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
so including uh Medical Care yes okay so
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
all the topics that listed in 20 so
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
we're just going to form a study
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
committee to study everything that's in
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
20 in this bill so we can figure out the
 
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
proper place for it again we have 30
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
months before you know as an end go goal
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
so we'll have some time for that the
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
ultimate punt yep all right uh moving on
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
to 21 uh data collection related to cans
 
02:18:58.399 --> 02:18:59.589 align:start position:0%
to 21 uh data collection related to cans
legalization

02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
regulation um Becka you were in charge
 
02:19:04.349 --> 02:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
you were chairing at this point I have
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
no changes on this so you had note here
 
02:19:08.399 --> 02:19:11.549 align:start position:0%
no changes on this so you had note here
nonenal

02:19:11.549 --> 02:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay so
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
line that's the old bill right if we're
 
02:19:17.590 --> 02:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
looking at the new
 
02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:19.070 align:start position:0%

reporting for any sort of uh acute care
 
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder issues will will
 
02:21:09.790 --> 02:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
that information be gleaned from
 
02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
hospital uh intake I don't know that
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
this includes that let me finish reading
 
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
so it says what what the report will
 
02:21:24.270 --> 02:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
includes but not limited to is high
 
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:26.040 align:start position:0%

02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis use disorder treatment my my
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
only point is that that if you really
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
want some actual data that you would get
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
it from the emergency
 
02:22:01.950 --> 02:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
rooms Mr chair would you agree Jim do
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
you have a point on that I also think
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we should include data from
 
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:07.630 align:start position:0%
maybe we should include data from
traffic

02:22:07.630 --> 02:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
fatalities that people are I I think
 
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.469 --> 02:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
section so we're going to make one
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
change to that action it's just going to
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
well we're going to add the Privacy data
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
and we're going to change that but not
 
02:22:25.750 --> 02:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
treatment right C uh cannabis fund
 
02:22:32.910 --> 02:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
established okay so again yeah I thank
 
02:22:37.469 --> 02:22:37.479 align:start position:0%
you excuse me thank you Mr chair um we
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
discussed and reached consensus on this
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
section um referring back to the new
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
Futures memo dated October 30th we
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to add the
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
language uh
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
in on page two number
 
02:23:03.870 --> 02:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
that so this is under Roman numeral this
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
one you talk about right Roman numeral
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
five so this is under Roman numeral five
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.429 --> 02:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
replace 10% shall be allocated the
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
substance abuse prevention treatment and
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund established under so
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
instead of the
 
02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:37.550 align:start position:0%
instead of the
um

02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
um
numeral

02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
02:23:42.190 --> 02:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
sorry so it's just a reallocation of the
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
funds instead of it going to um so we're
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
talking about after dedu the appropriate
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
charges to the fund the cost for
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
administering the
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
cost of the remaining funds under B um
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at section the small three
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
on page 28 it's about that 10% or 25
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
million whichever is less shall be
 
02:24:06.269 --> 02:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
credited to the substance abuse
 
02:24:09.389 --> 02:24:09.399 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and Recovery
 
02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
Fund and instead the language wants to
 
02:24:12.319 --> 02:24:15.990 align:start position:0%
Fund and instead the language wants to
read

02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
um 10 10% shall be allocated as subance
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention and Recovery Fund
 
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
established under and get rid of all the
 
02:24:25.230 --> 02:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
other language yep and then also in
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
regard to Roman numeral four let me make
 
02:24:32.269 --> 02:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
sure we're okay with three so instead of
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
all this other language that's in here
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
about all the different types of
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
treatment everything else we're putting
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
the money into the substance abuse
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery Fund for for
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
expans and we have language we went over
 
02:24:46.469 --> 02:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
already talking about the dispersement
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
of that fund for what what treatment
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
purposes and everything else my
 
02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
understanding is it'll be a separate
 
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
fund from the existing alcohol fund but
 
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
it will still be administered so to
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
speak by the treatment fund by the
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
commission y Governor's commission
 
02:25:04.110 --> 02:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
Governor's commission not yeah not so so
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to everybody so it
 
02:25:07.990 --> 02:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
should be so just I'm going to make the
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
one recommendation that it say um second
 
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
it it's that we will keep the 10% or 25
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
language as far as the amount goes we
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
did have a discussion uh based
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
on the speak couple the speakers that we
 
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh had here that uh 10% really isn't
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
really doesn't cover the the cost $4
 
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
million roughly what's that $4
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
million that would be the
 
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
based on our base again I'm going back
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
to 1598 and discussion we had about we
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
did this whole calculation based on
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
other states and per capita use and
 
02:26:00.750 --> 02:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
comparing that to New Hampshire for per
 
02:26:02.910 --> 02:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
capita use uh like Colorado and those
 
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
other states and the number we came up
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
with um 15% of that is around
 
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
3875 million in Revenue to the state and
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
if we allocate 10% to that it's rough
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
$3.8 million
 
02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.389 align:start position:0%
$3.8 million
roughly

02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
darl thinks the number is going to be
 
02:26:20.830 --> 02:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
sen abis thinks the number is going to
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
be much higher than that most I'm taking
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
more conservative the fiscal notes that
 
02:26:26.070 --> 02:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
I've seen on the other uh recreational
 
02:26:28.349 --> 02:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
Cannabis bills didn't really have any
 
02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
significant uh consideration for out
 
02:26:33.469 --> 02:26:33.479 align:start position:0%
estate consumers where I think a lot of
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
our retail markets you name it a lot of
 
02:26:40.269 --> 02:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
it's funded or by out of state consumers
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
so on a conservative approach I know
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
again Daryl thinks the num is going to
 
02:26:44.550 --> 02:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
be much higher I'm being a little more
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
conservative doing the number much lower
 
02:26:50.190 --> 02:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
um but the rough idea of 15% was $ 38.7
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
million in Revenue to the state and you
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
would get 10% of that to the fund which
 
02:26:57.150 --> 02:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
is $38 million would go for subance
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
abuse and treatment so we're looking at
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
little Roman numeral 3 correct
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
99 and that's going to be in your
 
02:27:08.670 --> 02:27:08.680 align:start position:0%
calculation will be a number that's
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to be around four million cor
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
right conservative
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
number because that right now right now
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
for alcohol coming from the alcohol
 
02:27:23.070 --> 02:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
funds which is about 10% it comes out
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
basically about $10 million that we get
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
and that does not come close to
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
covering the harm that's caused by
 
02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol where it's it's we when it is
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
fully funded there still isn't enough
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
funding to go around so now we're we're
 
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
going to introduce um cannabis and we're
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to say we're looking at just $4
 
02:27:47.309 --> 02:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
million well again that that's the
 
02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
extremely conservative side of that
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
number Dr do Dr Silver had indicated
 
02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
that rule of thumb based on her research
 
02:27:57.150 --> 02:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
and correct it from wrong other people
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
here that should be the number should be
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
30% of the revenue coming
 
02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:05.230 align:start position:0%
30% of the revenue coming
in

02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
so we're supposed to be making this you
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
know with as many God rails and safe and
 
02:28:14.429 --> 02:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
and safe to the state as possible so $4
 
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
million dollar a year really isn't going
 
02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
to cut
 
02:28:19.269 --> 02:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
the the anticipated harm that's going be
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
caused to the community understood
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
anybody I I agree with the
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
chief sen yes so just to I just want to
 
02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
be clear so what we're talking about is
 
02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:38.990 align:start position:0%
be clear so what we're talking about is
page

02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
28 eliminating the entirety of um line
 
02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.309 align:start position:0%
28 eliminating the entirety of um line
19

02:28:47.309 --> 02:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
19
 
02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
through 30 and replacing it
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
with so the language is uh 10% shall be
 
02:28:57.429 --> 02:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
allocated to the Substance Abuse
 
02:28:59.269 --> 02:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
Prevention and Recovery Fund established
 
02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
by RSA 318 f23 and I asked to lead the
 
02:29:09.630 --> 02:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
less so again CH Dave I understand you
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
you want the the need for more money and
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
Nothing Stops the
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
the future legisl change it if if the
 
02:29:22.030 --> 02:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
fund is being depleted and being overly
 
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
consumed no pun intended um then we can
 
02:29:27.790 --> 02:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
allow we can change the section A lot
 
02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and change the allotment for but I think
 
02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
on the initial blush in the house this
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
was the recommended language that made
 
02:29:35.710 --> 02:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
it 1598 made it through the house with
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
this distribution of funds and I think
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll it'll it's a it's a
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
political compromise if you will what I
 
02:29:45.790 --> 02:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is when the original
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
1598 that went forward and when it got
 
02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
kind of hung up in ways and means and
 
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
they changed it to this part of the
 
02:29:55.469 --> 02:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
problem was is that no one from DHHS
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
came in advocating for the money being
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
allocated there so it was really hard to
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
justify the expenditure I believe it
 
02:30:04.630 --> 02:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
would have been Justified but we need
 
02:30:07.110 --> 02:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
someone if someone came in and provided
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
some testimony of how that money would
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
be used that would go a long way I think
 
02:30:12.710 --> 02:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe Senator Lang was on the
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee in the house
 
02:30:16.710 --> 02:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
last term when I did testify and I was
 
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
asked that specific question where does
 
02:30:22.469 --> 02:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
the number 25 million come from and
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
being brutally honest be kind of just
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
pulled it out of the sky so if if it can
 
02:30:29.469 --> 02:30:29.479 align:start position:0%
be some specifics as to what that money
 
02:30:31.710 --> 02:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
would be used for I think that can go a
 
02:30:33.389 --> 02:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
long way and Senator Lang is I believe
 
02:30:35.710 --> 02:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
chair of a way me committee
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
now I so I understand what you're saying
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
about the the prior legislation but the
 
02:30:43.389 --> 02:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
result of last last the last legislative
 
02:30:48.429 --> 02:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
session was for us to listen to We we've
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
had testimony here we we ourselves had
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
testimony with the need for that and
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
what it would be going towards we heard
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
from the doctors from Massachusetts we
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
heard from uh Dr Lyn silver so I think
 
02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
we had the information here from very
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
credible sources that 30% is you know at
 
02:31:07.439 --> 02:31:08.389 align:start position:0%
credible sources that 30% is you know at
the

02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
minimum to uh would be would be the
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
discussion
yeah

02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:31:27.630 --> 02:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
um I think a much of the conversation in
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
this commission has been about public
 
02:31:33.269 --> 02:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
health and uh making sure that whatever
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
model that we do
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
um you know puts Public Health at top of
 
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
mind and so I would agree with what
 
02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying about the this amount and
 
02:31:46.990 --> 02:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we
 
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.190 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if we
I

02:31:48.190 --> 02:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
mean the recommendation of it being 10%
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
I think is a very fair start and then
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
you know should it go to finance which
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
it likely will maybe that's where they
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to place that limit that would be
 
02:32:01.190 --> 02:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
my suggestion keep it at the 10% and if
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
that limit wants to be placed on at the
 
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee do
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
that this is no by no means final
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
language that and and you know I think
 
02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
when it's in front of the the w means
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
Comm with the house or the Senate that's
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
the time to really fight this one out
 
02:32:17.309 --> 02:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
but I agree I think the number you're
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
talking about these to
 
02:32:21.309 --> 02:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
long so is the consensus to leave it at
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
10% 10% or $25 million je is less well I
 
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
think it's that latter Clause that we're
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
saying we don't need that that could
 
02:32:29.389 --> 02:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
that could be done at
 
02:32:32.750 --> 02:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
Finance is that what you're
 
02:32:34.710 --> 02:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
saying he wants
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
30% yeah he wants 30% so I don't think
 
02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's a 25 million or less that he's
 
02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
fighting over I think it's the
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
compensation of the percentage in in and
 
02:32:44.030 --> 02:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
of itself he's not happy with it so well
 
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
why don't we split that one second let
 
02:32:47.710 --> 02:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
go to Frank and I'll come to you
 
02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:49.630 align:start position:0%
go to Frank and I'll come to you
Chim

02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
Chim
 
02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
um my only thought here is I mean I
 
02:32:54.630 --> 02:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
agree in terms of having more money for
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
um for this um for this in this section
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
but just the flag if to keep the 25
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
million it just creates bad math at the
 
02:33:05.469 --> 02:33:05.479 align:start position:0%
end so I would just pull that and then
 
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
we keep it even percentages that's fine
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna die on that Hill okay so
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
leave it at 10% but but to the people
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
out there that want that number higher
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
when it's in front of the ways and means
 
02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:17.150 align:start position:0%
when it's in front of the ways and means
commit

02:33:17.150 --> 02:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
commit
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one there we saw what
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
happened I was just sitting there and no
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
one showse showed up to ask for that or
 
02:33:26.910 --> 02:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
Jud so at this this point we've adopted
 
02:33:28.910 --> 02:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to adopt the um was the new
 
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
Futures language who was it well before
 
02:33:35.150 --> 02:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
we do that Nami just um indicated that
 
02:33:37.790 --> 02:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
they had language on this as well that
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
was emailed we we adopted earlier in the
 
02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
day early in the bill some nami's
 
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
language about what it could be used for
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh there's a representative from Nami
 
02:33:56.110 --> 02:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
hi Holly Stevens um from Nami New
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we just had some language
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
in this section that would indicate that
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
50% of that 10% would be used for mental
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
health um mental illness treatment um
 
02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether there's a
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
co-occurring uh substance use disorder
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
or not the reason for that is just so
 
02:34:19.630 --> 02:34:19.640 align:start position:0%
that the governor's commission would be
 
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
aware that the money could well that 50%
 
02:34:23.950 --> 02:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
of it would have to be used for mental
 
02:34:27.230 --> 02:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
health and that in addition to that that
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't matter whether there was a
 
02:34:32.590 --> 02:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
co-occurring um substance disorder or
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
not I did send that language to um some
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
folks this weekend as well as asking for
 
02:34:40.950 --> 02:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
it to be sent to the full committee and
 
02:34:45.269 --> 02:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
I do have hard copies with me so it just
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
adds one sent sent to that section so if
 
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
you have hard copies why pass out so we
 
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
can all look at it so the exact language
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
where it goes so are you okay with what
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
we've adopted so far about Tien that
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
language and then add a second sentence
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:06.830 --> 02:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'd have no objection having another
 
02:35:08.349 --> 02:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of the whole fund going to
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
mental health but now we're cutting if
 
02:35:13.230 --> 02:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
we're mandating half the half the amount
 
02:35:15.630 --> 02:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
of the projected 4 million we haven't
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
adopted yet we're just having a
 
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
conversation just I would I would Echo
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
his sentiments um that that would be
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
even worse and and maybe maybe we should
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
just right now decide to maybe make it
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
15% and make a little compromise there
 
02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
you know he he suggesting 30 Dr Lyn
 
02:35:36.990 --> 02:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
silver who gave us fantastic testimony
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
overall suggested that we put all these
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
guide rails in before we go further down
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
the road um and her testimony was
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
phenomenal but why not give him 15 %
 
02:35:49.550 --> 02:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
30 further I want to wait till is the
 
02:36:00.389 --> 02:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
around I tell the first one the first
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
drafts on 1598 the first 25 million went
 
02:36:08.190 --> 02:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
to them but then no one showed up to the
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
hearing to advocate for that on in
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
myself so that's where I would get to
 
02:36:15.630 --> 02:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
this point so for the PE the advocacy to
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
get it
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
higher it's now in the
 
02:36:20.990 --> 02:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
reverse when they're saying what passed
 
02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
the house last
 
02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
term that's what that's what passed the
 
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
original language was much much better
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
or what your excuse
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
me oh you see right there I just that
 
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
way sen L could I just add that I agree
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the gentleman um and Senator abis
 
02:36:43.269 --> 02:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning that that DHS didn't
 
02:36:47.190 --> 02:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh DHHS didn't attend or show you know
 
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
interest in that having that discussion
 
02:36:52.230 --> 02:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
were they invited to provide testimony
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
on this topic because I'm not sure that
 
02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
everybody sort of you know looks how
 
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
they can swoop in and okay well so I a
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
formal invitation wasn't sent but I'm
 
02:37:05.309 --> 02:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
I'm confident they were DHS DHHS was
 
02:37:07.269 --> 02:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
aware of the so let's not look backwards
 
02:37:10.389 --> 02:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
again let's go forward okay um so I'll
 
02:37:13.630 --> 02:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
make a compromise how about we drop I to
 
02:37:18.990 --> 02:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
45% two two to 30% increase 3 to 20% oh
 
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
wait say that again so break it up so
 
02:37:22.510 --> 02:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's the first section in three in the
 
02:37:24.349 --> 02:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
breakdowns of funding so we're back into
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
the breakdowns so the first one will be
 
02:37:29.429 --> 02:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
45% the second one will be 25% we reduce
 
02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
5% from each one and then we'll add that
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
10% we just saved on the first two uh
 
02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
distributions and add it to the mental
 
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the uh sub abuse program I would just
 
02:37:44.429 --> 02:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
want to reduce it to 20% to hold on hold
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
on so we take we take a little bit from
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
each and and add it to the mental health
 
02:37:52.510 --> 02:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
and substance is that is that
 
02:37:54.510 --> 02:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable I prefer the lower the
 
02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes if if you ask me I think
 
02:37:58.950 --> 02:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that people are
 
02:38:00.269 --> 02:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the state are having to deal
 
02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
with so I think I don't I would want to
 
02:38:07.309 --> 02:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
leave Roman num I as it is R num one so
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:16.349 align:start position:0%
 
202

02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
202
 
02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
no 2020 yeah we're talking about
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
now when we're when we're talking
 
02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
about the 30% or whatever percentage
 
02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
that was going to be taken from the
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
revenues to was supposed to be to
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
alleviate the harm that is caused by uh
 
02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
legalization of marijuana uh cannabis
 
02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:42.190 align:start position:0%
legalization of marijuana uh cannabis
and

02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:44.750 --> 02:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
but now that we're saying we're going to
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
be funding mental health treatment that
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with it we haven't had
 
02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
a mental health language yet okay but I
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to come across as I'm I'm I
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
advocate I'm advocating for mental
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
health treatment uh I think if if if we
 
02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
want to use funds we should give them
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
their own light item so to speak and
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
give them funds but I'm still talking
 
02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
about the inadequacy of dealing with the
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
harm that's going to be happening from
 
02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
the use of marij uh the increased use of
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana so I just want to that
 
02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
clear I just also wanted to bring back
 
02:39:23.309 --> 02:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
the attention to the committee about um
 
02:39:26.269 --> 02:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
the harm that they know that it's linked
 
02:39:29.150 --> 02:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
to first episode psychosis and we've
 
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
heard from Dr SED at New Hampshire
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
hospital as well as Lisa Madden at um
 
02:39:37.150 --> 02:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
right here in in h
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
conquer that they are planning to see a
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
huge increase in um mental illness and
 
02:39:46.510 --> 02:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
with the first episode cois if somebody
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
only smokes once and they end up with
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
that condition for the rest of their
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
life they may not have a
 
02:39:54.910 --> 02:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
co-occurring substance use disorder
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
because they may never use again and so
 
02:39:58.830 --> 02:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
that is why we think it's extremely
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
important for one you know for the
 
02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
prevention of substance use disorders in
 
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the first place we know that a lot of
 
02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
folks who have depression anxiety and
 
02:40:10.590 --> 02:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
psychosis end up using in order to
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
alleviate the symptoms um and we also
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
know that um it it causes certain now
 
02:40:20.150 --> 02:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
now we know there's a correlation
 
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
between use and the uptick in mental
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
illness and that's the reason that we're
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
making that request because we think
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's so correlated that it's important
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
that half the money go to mental health
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
treatment all right so let's see if we
 
02:40:38.429 --> 02:40:38.439 align:start position:0%
can Corral this into a into some sort of
 
02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
vote for position so we can move on
 
02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
Chief did you have something okay so
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
right now the discussion is 50220 is to
 
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
propose change to allow I will say that
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
as again I was on Ways and Means last
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
term and and the amendment that changed
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
these percentages with my amendment that
 
02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
that set this up and again I did it
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
based on conversation who came in and
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
testified and who came in and for the
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire about how money
 
02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
was going to be used and what was going
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
on and to to Senator abbas's Point
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
nobody showed up like even this we were
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
I was a little nervous about even this
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
language because we didn't have whether
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
or not um the agency was agreeing to it
 
02:41:18.309 --> 02:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
even um and so um I I'm going to
 
02:41:20.750 --> 02:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
recommend the 50 2020 I'd rather not
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
include the mental health provision I'd
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
rather you work with the with the
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
commission to figure out what the best
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
use of the funds that they have are for
 
02:41:29.830 --> 02:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether mental health is that component
 
02:41:31.150 --> 02:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to split it up to
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
another percentage mental health is is
 
02:41:35.950 --> 02:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
INR uh that's for children
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
specifically so we have and remember we
 
02:41:40.550 --> 02:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
do have a second line of 5% the very the
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
very next uh um bottom line number five
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
is a 5% distributed to dhh just for this
 
02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
explicit purpose of mental health for
 
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
children I I need to add one more
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
wrinkle apologies we did also agree as a
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
group to add the Justice reinvestment
 
02:41:58.469 --> 02:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
fund that was on the memo the new
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
Futures memo that you Senator abis can
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
ice see that langage page page three
 
02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:13.269 align:start position:0%
ice see that langage page page three
number

02:42:13.269 --> 02:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.070 --> 02:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
I guess this will provide for people
 
02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:23.630 align:start position:0%
I guess this will provide for people
impacted

02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
02:42:26.150 --> 02:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
from Impact so that language was
 
02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:38.349 --> 02:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
right so and that was important um to
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
both new futures of the public health um
 
02:42:45.389 --> 02:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
agen or organization uh it was important
 
02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
into other Justice focused groups that
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
were supporting legalization for the
 
02:42:51.910 --> 02:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of making sure that we are
 
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
rebalancing uh that particular issue
 
02:42:55.750 --> 02:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
about the impact of legalization on
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
communities of color um so that was a
 
02:42:59.910 --> 02:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
tenant that was agreed to I think by I
 
02:43:02.190 --> 02:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know if so what
 
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
percentage where's this money coming
 
02:43:04.950 --> 02:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
from well and that's the conversation
 
02:43:06.190 --> 02:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's why right so now we're going to
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
strip down the percentages even more can
 
02:43:10.349 --> 02:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
I can I ask so it says the f the fund
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
shall be used to support communities and
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
individuals impacted by poverty
 
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment and underemployment and
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis enforcement so this is just I I
 
02:43:23.469 --> 02:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
understand what the I'm not saying these
 
02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
are you not good causes but this is this
 
02:43:29.389 --> 02:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
the timee we're dealing with this I mean
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have an analment section already
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've even expanded that what having now
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
a fund to do
 
02:43:39.469 --> 02:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm just what do we what are we
 
02:43:43.469 --> 02:43:43.479 align:start position:0%
figure what are we trying to do here I
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
think the the thinking of this is beyond
 
02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are impacted by past
 
02:43:49.309 --> 02:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
criminal convictions it's kind of the
 
02:43:51.469 --> 02:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
global impact of the war on drugs and
 
02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
how it's been disproportionately felt by
 
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
certain communities uh certain
 
02:43:57.790 --> 02:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
individuals and certain communities um
 
02:43:59.630 --> 02:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
and it's an attempt to start to create
 
02:44:02.870 --> 02:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
redress for that history um and so
 
02:44:04.269 --> 02:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
because of underinvestment in those
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
communities um and over enforcement in
 
02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
those communities having enfor I'm sorry
 
02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
over enforcement well if you look at um
 
02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
disparity rates in terms of Marijuana
 
02:44:15.230 --> 02:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
arrest for example you know we know
 
02:44:16.349 --> 02:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
black people and white people use
 
02:44:18.190 --> 02:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
marijuana at roughly the same rate in
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire black people are over four
 
02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
times more likely to be arrested than
 
02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
white people looking at the most recent
 
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
202020 or 2022 2022 FBI UCR
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
data who are people getting arrested in
 
02:44:32.910 --> 02:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire still for marijuana I I'm
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
not hearing about any according to the
 
02:44:37.389 --> 02:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
FBI data sets it we at almost a thousand
 
02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
people FBI FBI yes how many people were
 
02:44:42.990 --> 02:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
arrested though uh almost a, 9960
 
02:44:44.110 --> 02:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
something a thousand people were
 
02:44:45.550 --> 02:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
arrested for using marij marijuana in
 
02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 2022 when it's been
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
decriminalized is that are those being
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
prosecuted at the I'm just trying to get
 
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
hold up here what we're what we're
 
02:44:57.469 --> 02:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
actually going to be
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
aling I'm not sure of the distribution
 
02:45:02.030 --> 02:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
of those um those straight up arrest
 
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be prosecuted at the Attorney
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
General's office so I don't have
 
02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
specific information yeah I mean I can
 
02:45:09.710 --> 02:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
let's get control of the committee again
 
02:45:12.429 --> 02:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
so Frank go ahead you respond to the AG
 
02:45:16.269 --> 02:45:16.279 align:start position:0%
and then be um yes so this is just of
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
FBI UCR data portal for arrests in New
 
02:45:21.870 --> 02:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 2020 20 2022 is the most
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
recent and it was late 960 arrests so I
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't know the outcome I don't know
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
quantity this is but this is only
 
02:45:30.269 --> 02:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
possession not possession with intent or
 
02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
distribution or things like that um and
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
so this fund was our you know an attempt
 
02:45:37.389 --> 02:45:37.399 align:start position:0%
by a number of Advocates to set up some
 
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
type of process and some type of Revenue
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
stream that could go towards redress for
 
02:45:44.510 --> 02:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
those historical injustices that have
 
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
happened here in in our
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
state sen Whitley yeah I just was hoping
 
02:45:50.190 --> 02:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
that Kate from new Futures could come up
 
02:45:51.389 --> 02:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
and speak to that issue as well because
 
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
it was in her Memo hold on um
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative hunt John yeah I'm
 
02:45:58.990 --> 02:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
because I like to move things along um
 
02:46:00.429 --> 02:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
the problem I'm having is is we're
 
02:46:03.150 --> 02:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
debating numbers so we have no idea how
 
02:46:05.429 --> 02:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
much money we're going to bring in so my
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
preference would be that we create these
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
funds because we think the public policy
 
02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
that these funds should exist put in a
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
minimum dollar amount that we pretty
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
sure we will get within the first three
 
02:46:20.269 --> 02:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
years or whatever this thing is and then
 
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
knowing full well that things change and
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
three years from now we're where the
 
02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
best place to be putting money it might
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
be different than what we think of today
 
02:46:32.190 --> 02:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
and let the ways and means committees in
 
02:46:35.389 --> 02:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
the future years then decide to put more
 
02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
money in the funds that are most
 
02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate but that that just get
 
02:46:41.710 --> 02:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
create the funds put some minimal amount
 
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
of money into each one of them and then
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
let let the process play itself
 
02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:51.309 align:start position:0%
let let the process play itself
out

02:46:51.309 --> 02:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:54.750 --> 02:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
Chief these numbers that you're reciting
 
02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
are from State Police numbers being
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
entered into
 
02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
UCR that are actual short summonses for
 
02:47:05.469 --> 02:47:05.479 align:start position:0%
violations these are not arrest these
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
are part of the decriminalization
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
process that's we've gone through so
 
02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's not arrest okay it's it's enfor
 
02:47:17.590 --> 02:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
of what we're supposed to be doing it's
 
02:47:19.950 --> 02:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
not we're picking on individuals we're
 
02:47:23.309 --> 02:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws as they're currently
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
written Su I just want to add that the
 
02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
it looks like the categories that that
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
are already listed here are are known
 
02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
concrete tangible things to put money
 
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
towards and when you start working off
 
02:47:39.309 --> 02:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
of a social justice framework it ends up
 
02:47:41.309 --> 02:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
being something with good intent but a
 
02:47:44.309 --> 02:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
total bul doogle at every turn and so I
 
02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
I would recommend just keeping it with
 
02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the actual concrete things that
 
02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
people can see on a tangible level like
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems education substance
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
abuse treatment
 
02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
Etc further comment senator be Whitley
 
02:47:58.590 --> 02:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the social justice
 
02:48:00.269 --> 02:48:00.279 align:start position:0%
framework is incredibly important I
 
02:48:02.790 --> 02:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a boond dog all I think
 
02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
many many many people support
 
02:48:07.230 --> 02:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
legalization for the very one of the
 
02:48:09.309 --> 02:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
critical points about why they support
 
02:48:12.110 --> 02:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
it is because of the unequal enforcement
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
of drug laws and so I don't think it's a
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
boond dog I think it's very very
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
critical piece of this discussion I
 
02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
would be supportive of what
 
02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative hunt suggested about
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
creating the funds and then letting the
 
02:48:27.389 --> 02:48:27.399 align:start position:0%
various policy Finance committees
 
02:48:30.070 --> 02:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
determine the percentages so I would
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
advocate for adding this Justice
 
02:48:34.990 --> 02:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
reinvestment fund and then you know the
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
creation of the fund and let you know
 
02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
punt on the issue I would add that if
 
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
people care about social justice in this
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
and if this is a priority for them it's
 
02:48:45.190 --> 02:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
really in a lot of ways many people have
 
02:48:48.309 --> 02:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
been in some ways um the numbers get
 
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
inflated where you're talking about
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
arrest and and chief is correcting it
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
saying this not it's just part of the
 
02:48:56.269 --> 02:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
process so if if any of this the social
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
justice aspect of this gets say people
 
02:49:01.070 --> 02:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
are really uh wanting this language in
 
02:49:04.190 --> 02:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
there um I would I would counter to say
 
02:49:05.790 --> 02:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
they've been there's been a lot of Mal
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
education on the social justice aspect
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
Frank I would I guess just push back
 
02:49:11.550 --> 02:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
they're not inflated that's literally
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
just if you go to the FBI UCR data
 
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
portal that's what it says I'm just
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
providing that information to the
 
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee but there's not even a
 
02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
definition of people of color so all
 
02:49:24.469 --> 02:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
right so so let's let's re it back in so
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the question is do we want to
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
establish fund John's repr hunts
 
02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
recommended we establish fund I tend to
 
02:49:31.469 --> 02:49:31.479 align:start position:0%
disagree with this concept and the only
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
reason it being is it's a bigger broader
 
02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
larger conversation than just this one
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
topic of marijuana um we have programs
 
02:49:40.590 --> 02:49:40.600 align:start position:0%
already to deal with poverty we have
 
02:49:41.630 --> 02:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
programs already to deal with
 
02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
underemployment we have programs already
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with all these things within the
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
state and going to carve out a little
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
more money and stick it somewhere that
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a unified program
 
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
accessible or given directed towards
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
this so I don't think this is the place
 
02:49:58.590 --> 02:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
to have this kind of conversation myself
 
02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
I think that someone wants to bring a
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill in to do this have at it and you
 
02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
know come to my fees and funds committee
 
02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
over in ways and means I'll be happy to
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
have that discussion um but I'm not sure
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
that this is the right Bill to start
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
having a social discussion which is what
 
02:50:15.630 --> 02:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
this is a social discussion
 
02:50:17.590 --> 02:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not an enforcement
 
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
discussion it's not a legalization
 
02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
discussion it's about social social
 
02:50:22.950 --> 02:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
policy which and I don't think it
 
02:50:26.269 --> 02:50:26.279 align:start position:0%
belongs in this bill my personal belief
 
02:50:29.469 --> 02:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
so all those in favor of adding this
 
02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
fund into the bill raise your
 
02:50:35.910 --> 02:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
hand all those opposed raise your hand
 
02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to strike that language and
 
02:50:38.790 --> 02:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to do an addendum to the
 
02:50:41.309 --> 02:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
committee to bring that language in
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
that um moving on so we're all set with
 
02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry do we finalize 50 2020 we
 
02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
are all all those in favor of 50220
 
02:50:54.710 --> 02:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
02:50:59.229 --> 02:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:02.030 --> 02:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
20255 so the eyes have it we'll leave it
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
we'll change the breakdown to 50 20 2055
 
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
for the dispersement of
 
02:51:12.510 --> 02:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
funds um moving on to 20 section 23 can
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
I can I just discuss some number two
 
02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:16.590 align:start position:0%
I can I just discuss some number two
real

02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:51:20.309 --> 02:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
quick disperse to um the Retirement
 
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
Systems unfunded AC crude
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
liabilities this is a co- mangling of
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
funds if you put marijuana money into
 
02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
the retirement system that will
 
02:51:33.550 --> 02:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the entire retirement system
 
02:51:35.550 --> 02:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
all of the money in there so the entire
 
02:51:38.750 --> 02:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill is is a comingling of funds we have
 
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
one is education trust fund we're
 
02:51:42.349 --> 02:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
dumping marijuana money into education I
 
02:51:45.229 --> 02:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
understand that so but it jeopardizes is
 
02:51:48.269 --> 02:51:48.279 align:start position:0%
all current and former state employees
 
02:51:48.279 --> 02:51:49.269 align:start position:0%
all current and former state employees
local

02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
local
 
02:51:51.950 --> 02:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
employees as far as their retirement
 
02:51:54.750 --> 02:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
system so I think we heard from the
 
02:51:56.349 --> 02:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
treasur the state treasurer who said
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
that they could this could be
 
02:52:02.429 --> 02:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
done without without that risk all right
 
02:52:04.990 --> 02:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
moving on we're at section 23 the
 
02:52:07.469 --> 02:52:07.479 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention and Recovery
 
02:52:11.630 --> 02:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
Fund um any conversation here Becca you
 
02:52:13.110 --> 02:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
were again you were in charge during
 
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
this so I'm not sure want to make sure
 
02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:19.389 align:start position:0%
this so I'm not sure want to make sure
that

02:52:19.389 --> 02:52:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
have right so this was the consensus
 
02:52:30.229 --> 02:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
that we should create a separate non-aps
 
02:52:35.670 --> 02:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.590 --> 02:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
Chief so how about we add uh there's
 
02:52:41.349 --> 02:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
hereby established in the State Treasury
 
02:52:41.359 --> 02:52:42.790 align:start position:0%
hereby established in the State Treasury
the

02:52:42.790 --> 02:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:44.790 --> 02:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
non-aps right well make here it says
 
02:52:47.229 --> 02:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
non-lps in
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
MH Subs abuse treatment uh prevention
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery Fund yep yep did
 
02:52:57.550 --> 02:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
we change your name of that we did yeah
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
just it's it's uh we did it all through
 
02:53:02.110 --> 02:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
the bill earlier it's substance abuse uh
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and
 
02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
Recovery uh that be distinct and
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
separate from all other funds
 
02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
yep so again the the 20% that we is
 
02:53:20.990 --> 02:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
f um TW page 29 that looks like we had
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
um uh no changes according to my notes
 
02:53:32.389 --> 02:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
the line out the strikeouts you do were
 
02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
30 would you strike out no no we didn't
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
strike anything else we just said the
 
02:53:46.590 --> 02:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
strikeouts are already in there were
 
02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
from a previous strikeout cor that
 
02:53:52.229 --> 02:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't based on us
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
um well Becky you had a conversation
 
02:53:56.670 --> 02:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
around the definition of marijuana it
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
looks like yeah we got rid we got rid of
 
02:53:59.439 --> 02:54:00.750 align:start position:0%
looks like yeah we got rid we got rid of
the

02:54:00.750 --> 02:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
definition right and we we were just
 
02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to add a reference because there
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
was conversation about we use cannabis
 
02:54:06.720 --> 02:54:07.790 align:start position:0%
was conversation about we use cannabis
and

02:54:07.790 --> 02:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:10.910 --> 02:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana so the idea being just say Mar
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh subject marijuana includes the
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis products
 
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
for no we were going to use instead of
 
02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
the definition for marijuana we were
 
02:54:19.830 --> 02:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to use the definition that we
 
02:54:22.070 --> 02:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
already created for
 
02:54:24.309 --> 02:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis let me go back
 
02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
30 and I apologize interrupting my on my
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
computer the line number is no longer
 
02:54:41.469 --> 02:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.710 --> 02:54:43.720 align:start position:0%
think instead of you you want to do a
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
cut and I not have the definition
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
reference have two different definitions
 
02:54:49.710 --> 02:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
defined I think it's smarter to say
 
02:54:53.429 --> 02:54:53.439 align:start position:0%
marijuana and do just a reference to uh
 
02:54:57.229 --> 02:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
318 F1 Roman numeral 2 yeah me just say
 
02:54:57.239 --> 02:54:58.309 align:start position:0%
318 F1 Roman numeral 2 yeah me just say
marijuana

02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
means the definition of cannabis as
 
02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
defined in does that make
 
02:55:06.510 --> 02:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
sense well we were going to eliminate
 
02:55:09.389 --> 02:55:09.399 align:start position:0%
the definition of marijuana Al together
 
02:55:10.510 --> 02:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
well I think the problem we have is it's
 
02:55:12.150 --> 02:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
referenced in other parts of the statute
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
no it's not because that's that's that's
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the area that we're
 
02:55:20.309 --> 02:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
talking about so I think so 318 B2 is
 
02:55:21.870 --> 02:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the B right right
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's in the definition section yeah so
 
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
we want the controlled Drug Act to
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
Define marijuana as the definition we're
 
02:55:33.190 --> 02:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
using in we're using 318
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
F what we're trying to do is is use
 
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
consistent language across all of our
 
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
statutes so we're switching all of the
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
references to marijuana and current law
 
02:55:45.309 --> 02:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
to our current new def of cannabis so
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
just so so again so the recommendation I
 
02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
think if I'm reading this right it will
 
02:55:52.269 --> 02:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
say instead of this big long from 14 to
 
02:55:55.870 --> 02:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
20 we have in here now um the statute
 
02:55:59.950 --> 02:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
will say Mar uh for the purpose of
 
02:56:02.269 --> 02:56:02.279 align:start position:0%
section marijuana will be defined as in
 
02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
RSA what is the 318
 
02:56:09.190 --> 02:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
F1 yeah Roman numeral 2 we got to change
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
it does that make sense everybody we're
 
02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to use go back to the original
 
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
definition of just cannabis say Mar
 
02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
marijuana equals the definition of
 
02:56:19.870 --> 02:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis which is on 318 F1 Roman
 
02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:22.550 align:start position:0%
cannabis which is on 318 F1 Roman
numeral

02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:27.429 --> 02:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
darl number one number
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
two all
 
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
31 this is
 
02:56:44.990 --> 02:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
again but if we reference to Dam
 
02:56:50.910 --> 02:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
matter do matter we need or we just need
 
02:56:54.239 --> 02:56:55.309 align:start position:0%
matter do matter we need or we just need
to

02:56:55.309 --> 02:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
say I want to change that's going to be
 
02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
repealed all right so nothing on 31
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
32 oh last we take that up
 
02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.070 align:start position:0%
32 oh last we take that up
yeah

02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:12.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

02:57:12.990 --> 02:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.469 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:57:15.469 --> 02:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:17.070 --> 02:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
02:57:20.349 --> 02:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
say I'm sure be free upon request by the
 
02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
defendant and by so here we're talking
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
about the analment of certain crimes or
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
convictions of cannabis and this is
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
where the Frank has some language
 
02:57:32.790 --> 02:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere see all should have somewhere
 
02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:35.800 align:start position:0%
was handed out
 
02:57:39.070 --> 02:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
um this this sheet that looks like this
 
02:57:40.830 --> 02:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
and talks about the enement process
 
02:57:42.070 --> 02:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
Frank why don't you walk us through this
 
02:57:44.750 --> 02:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
real quick definitely so uh
 
02:57:49.229 --> 02:57:49.239 align:start position:0%
um the first part is just definitions um
 
02:57:52.190 --> 02:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
section the second part has to do with
 
02:57:55.269 --> 02:57:55.279 align:start position:0%
um arrests and convictions um it
 
02:57:58.269 --> 02:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
includes a process to challenge
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
particularly in the context of
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
distribution uh to youth if the past
 
02:58:05.469 --> 02:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
conviction had to do with that um and
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
giving uh prosecutors in the court the
 
02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
ability to not Grant the um the analment
 
02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
if that if those facts are in relevant
 
02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
in this in the individual
 
02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
case um the next section is just an
 
02:58:23.389 --> 02:58:23.399 align:start position:0%
automatic enement for and this is just
 
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and violation level offenses
 
02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:27.510 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and violation level offenses
for

02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana um third section you can just
 
02:58:32.590 --> 02:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
strike because this is resentencing and
 
02:58:34.030 --> 02:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
I know we talked about not doing
 
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
resentencing in this
 
02:58:39.070 --> 02:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
bill um and then the fourth section is
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
the what we had talked about in our
 
02:58:43.590 --> 02:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
earlier conversation around uh pending
 
02:58:45.150 --> 02:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
marijana want cases and just the
 
02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
dismissal process and so this was uh the
 
02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
product of a number of folks uh working
 
02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
on a standalone Bill and so we thought
 
02:58:54.229 --> 02:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
this might be more appropriate to try
 
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
and incorporate in here um and also to
 
02:58:58.990 --> 02:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
kind of work through the way the current
 
02:59:05.670 --> 02:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:07.870 --> 02:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
operates so again I'm only looking at
 
02:59:09.550 --> 02:59:09.560 align:start position:0%
the first page and the top of the second
 
02:59:11.710 --> 02:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
page right now
 
02:59:14.750 --> 02:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
um of the back of the page um yeah sorry
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
for my printing that's okay so we're
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
talking about basically anybody who's
 
02:59:21.870 --> 02:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
been convicted of a crime that's now
 
02:59:24.110 --> 02:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
going to be legal um is eligible to
 
02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
submit a petition to the court for an
 
02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
analment of the previous
 
02:59:30.229 --> 02:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
conviction um and that law enforcement
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
that upon a receiving that petition the
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
court will notify the prosecutor the
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
prosecutor then have a a right to object
 
02:59:40.429 --> 02:59:40.439 align:start position:0%
um based on the grounds that are in here
 
02:59:41.830 --> 02:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
um the you know the offense is not
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for annulment um
 
02:59:47.389 --> 02:59:47.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing and then um absent
 
02:59:50.830 --> 02:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:53.630 --> 02:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
granted I think that that does create a
 
02:59:56.349 --> 02:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
legal problem so that means the Court's
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
going to be required to go around and
 
03:00:02.349 --> 03:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
find every single possession conviction
 
03:00:04.950 --> 03:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's happened and then they they're
 
03:00:09.790 --> 03:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
required to then basically anull that
 
03:00:12.030 --> 03:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
which I I understand some people may
 
03:00:13.870 --> 03:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
feel that that condition was an injust
 
03:00:16.429 --> 03:00:16.439 align:start position:0%
in the first place but I'm just saying
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's every single one and I'm not even
 
03:00:21.750 --> 03:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
sure the court has a mechanism finding
 
03:00:23.190 --> 03:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
pulling them up that way now if someone
 
03:00:24.950 --> 03:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
applies for an analment well this is an
 
03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
application process right yeah this is
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
an application process it has an
 
03:00:30.269 --> 03:00:30.279 align:start position:0%
application yeah so again it says any
 
03:00:32.590 --> 03:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
person who was arrested or convicted May
 
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
at any time petition the court yeah so
 
03:00:37.229 --> 03:00:37.239 align:start position:0%
again this isn't a a universal wipe this
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
is the person who is subject to the
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
criminal offense has to request um the
 
03:00:44.990 --> 03:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
analment and then upon upon request of
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
the annulment the court will begin the
 
03:00:48.950 --> 03:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
process which is to notify the
 
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
underlying arresting uh Authority let
 
03:00:53.510 --> 03:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
them object if they choose to and if
 
03:00:55.710 --> 03:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
they don't object in a timely fashion
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
then it's presumed to be allowed to be
 
03:00:59.590 --> 03:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
analled and the court will just anull it
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
at that point and if the if the law
 
03:01:04.150 --> 03:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement does object there'll be a
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
hearing and the and the law enforcement
 
03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
present its evidence to why it should
 
03:01:09.510 --> 03:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
not be a
 
03:01:11.469 --> 03:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
known Chief do you have a comment on
 
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
that you you good I have no comment okay
 
03:01:17.070 --> 03:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
and do you mind emailing
 
03:01:20.150 --> 03:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
that so are we okay with that Dave just
 
03:01:24.269 --> 03:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity uh it outlines
 
03:01:26.750 --> 03:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
what would be it seems like to outline
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
what would be grounds for an objection
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
to be made but I see nothing if somebody
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
has had a subsequent and steady uh
 
03:01:40.030 --> 03:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
criminal record it doesn't allow the
 
03:01:42.229 --> 03:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
prosecutor it seems by reading this
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow the prosecutor to say say
 
03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
well this part of getting an analment is
 
03:01:48.750 --> 03:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
that you you haven't committed any
 
03:01:51.790 --> 03:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
crimes since
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
then our thinking here is that it's no
 
03:01:57.030 --> 03:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's no longer illegal and so the
 
03:01:59.309 --> 03:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
presumption should be in favor of
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
clearing the record um and so if there's
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
other criminal things happening
 
03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
obviously those that record would
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintain um this is just with regard to
 
03:02:09.830 --> 03:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
something that is no longer legal so
 
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's we thought was an appropriate
 
03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:12.550 align:start position:0%
that's we thought was an appropriate
balance

03:02:12.550 --> 03:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
balance
 
03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:16.389 align:start position:0%
balance
there

03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
further conversation about the inment
 
03:02:19.670 --> 03:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
process again I'm only going number five
 
03:02:22.150 --> 03:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
all fees where at the last section just
 
03:02:24.070 --> 03:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
a quick question for Frank um why two
 
03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
ounces is that
 
03:02:29.349 --> 03:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
a on the first page on right at near the
 
03:02:30.830 --> 03:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
beginning you had two ounces one at
 
03:02:33.229 --> 03:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
three one at one oh sorry I think I was
 
03:02:34.630 --> 03:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
thinking that was the amount we were
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to so that would just be tweaked
 
03:02:38.670 --> 03:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
to it reflect whatever the legalization
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
limit is okay again earlier we we we
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
recommended four as the number so this
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
number should go to four right if you
 
03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
have four ounces or less and you're
 
03:02:50.429 --> 03:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
convicted of a
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
um because it's now
 
03:02:56.510 --> 03:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
legal so is there any objection to
 
03:02:58.950 --> 03:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
includes let me do a switch all those in
 
03:03:03.550 --> 03:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
favor of of using this um language as
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
presented up to number five this as far
 
03:03:07.229 --> 03:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
as we're we're talking about that for
 
03:03:08.830 --> 03:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
right now so want to talk to Frank about
 
03:03:11.670 --> 03:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of it um who's in favor of
 
03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
Frank so who's opposed to including this
 
03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:25.590 align:start position:0%
Frank so who's opposed to including this
anman

03:03:25.590 --> 03:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
anman
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
language all right so we're not going to
 
03:03:29.710 --> 03:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
include so we're back to the existing
 
03:03:31.070 --> 03:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
language that's in
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
there um my recommendation is again this
 
03:03:35.870 --> 03:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
is another thing that we it's been
 
03:03:37.349 --> 03:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
debated and I think the conversations
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
are healthy but when you have a very
 
03:03:44.269 --> 03:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
complex uh policy Bill like this that
 
03:03:46.269 --> 03:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
we're putting forward perhaps the
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
analment section is one that we we
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
revisit separately and not let let this
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
be part of the stalling process Mr chair
 
03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
you mean like like representative hunt
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
suggested making a study committee for
 
03:04:01.630 --> 03:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
an nment I'm not sure this one needs as
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
much studying but
 
03:04:07.070 --> 03:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
yes or punting might be the other term
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's been thrown around it just we
 
03:04:10.110 --> 03:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
don't we don't agree on which one to go
 
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
with but this is this is not really
 
03:04:15.750 --> 03:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
related to this state run franchise
 
03:04:17.670 --> 03:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
model and that for that reason I think
 
03:04:20.110 --> 03:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
we can I would take the analment section
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
out not saying that they shouldn't be I
 
03:04:26.429 --> 03:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
mean I think having consistency there is
 
03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
we we should do that but do we do it in
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
this bill I would say
 
03:04:34.990 --> 03:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
no so is your recommendation um Senator
 
03:04:37.389 --> 03:04:37.399 align:start position:0%
abis that we strike the entire section
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
the number 15 on P starting at the
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 31 new section sentences
 
03:04:43.750 --> 03:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
annulment of certain arrest in Comm I we
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
strike all of that yeah and then that's
 
03:04:47.750 --> 03:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
not again that's not a criticism to the
 
03:04:49.710 --> 03:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
policy it's just maybe that's better off
 
03:04:52.150 --> 03:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
as a standalone I know Senator again you
 
03:04:56.830 --> 03:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
have a bill on the nanograms for driving
 
03:04:59.070 --> 03:04:59.080 align:start position:0%
it's a separate bill altoe and I think
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
you look it it will go through the
 
03:05:05.269 --> 03:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
policy changes okay M um I think we
 
03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
would object to that I think for a lot
 
03:05:08.309 --> 03:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that we talked about with
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
regard to the investment the social
 
03:05:13.389 --> 03:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
justice investment fund um because
 
03:05:15.229 --> 03:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
there's a legacy of discriminatory
 
03:05:17.469 --> 03:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement in New Hampshire I think is
 
03:05:19.870 --> 03:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
one aspect and also just the Practical
 
03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
reality that I think part of what we're
 
03:05:23.790 --> 03:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do is remove hurdles
 
03:05:25.510 --> 03:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hurdles to people being able
 
03:05:27.710 --> 03:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
to succeed in their communities and we
 
03:05:29.870 --> 03:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
know from substantial research that both
 
03:05:32.070 --> 03:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
access to housing and access to
 
03:05:35.630 --> 03:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
employment are key um U markers of
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
successful ways to reduce recidivism we
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
also know that having a marijuana
 
03:05:42.229 --> 03:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
conviction on your record makes it more
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to both get housing and to get
 
03:05:46.550 --> 03:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
employment um so I think you know our
 
03:05:48.030 --> 03:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
from our perspective if we're really
 
03:05:49.870 --> 03:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
focused on public safety and and
 
03:05:53.070 --> 03:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
creating a harm reduction prior um bill
 
03:05:55.070 --> 03:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
then ensuring that we have a clean
 
03:05:57.950 --> 03:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
process for annulments is is key to that
 
03:05:59.229 --> 03:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
but we have that for three quarters
 
03:06:00.830 --> 03:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
announc us
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
right do we want to change that now or
 
03:06:06.469 --> 03:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
not represent sen Whitley sorry yeah I I
 
03:06:08.110 --> 03:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to taking this section
 
03:06:12.229 --> 03:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
out I think also we are now making some
 
03:06:15.750 --> 03:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're this is this is making
 
03:06:17.309 --> 03:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
something legal and so it's a
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
fundamental unfairness about not
 
03:06:21.469 --> 03:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue about you know
 
03:06:24.190 --> 03:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
people that were arrested for net
 
03:06:25.710 --> 03:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
conduct that will not be legal I think
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
if we don't address this I think that's
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
a huge gap that's a punt that I'm not
 
03:06:32.790 --> 03:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
willing to participate in all right so
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
any other new comments sure so the only
 
03:06:38.349 --> 03:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is again I think that
 
03:06:40.990 --> 03:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
nothing prohibits anybody from refiling
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
already for an enement once if this was
 
03:06:44.229 --> 03:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
to become law they could file for an
 
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
analment so nothing prohibits them so
 
03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're not prohibiting any activity by a
 
03:06:49.550 --> 03:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
person already convicted the only
 
03:06:51.429 --> 03:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
process only thing we're saying is that
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be an automated
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
process for um an could could we just
 
03:06:57.630 --> 03:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
change the existing Anan law and it says
 
03:07:00.349 --> 03:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
34s anounce could we just change that to
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
say whatever the number we come up with
 
03:07:06.269 --> 03:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
Ian why are we having this whole new
 
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
section well the question is we're going
 
03:07:09.229 --> 03:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
to take it out now and leave it for
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
someone to file a bill which again we
 
03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
have 30 months before this is
 
03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
potentially going happen so anybody
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
after anybody could file for an enement
 
03:07:20.830 --> 03:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
anyway as it exists so I I was just
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
about to off I says what let's just not
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel because we know
 
03:07:25.469 --> 03:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen for three
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
years so let's if if we all we have to
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
do is take the current law and put in
 
03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill this looks like when
 
03:07:37.389 --> 03:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
we're here and then to to refine it to
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
make it better that absolutely is is
 
03:07:42.030 --> 03:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
best to be handled through a separate
 
03:07:44.070 --> 03:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislation so let's let's take a a
 
03:07:45.550 --> 03:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
quick vote and see where we are rather
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
than keep having a a circular discussion
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
um all those in favor of
 
03:07:56.309 --> 03:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
striking um at the bottom of 31 new
 
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
section sentences annulment and certain
 
03:08:00.389 --> 03:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
arrests and convictions for cannabis
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
striking that entire section all the way
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
to the page 32 line 26 which are all the
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
provisions of that all those in favor of
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
striking that language and letting it
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with somewhere else raise your
 
03:08:14.469 --> 03:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
hand so that's the majority of the
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee so we're going to strike that
 
03:08:20.830 --> 03:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
again and again this if this if this
 
03:08:26.469 --> 03:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
legislation filed that this whatever
 
03:08:28.469 --> 03:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
this Comm commission recommends they can
 
03:08:30.590 --> 03:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
be an amendment to that bill when it's
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
fired fired
 
03:08:35.349 --> 03:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
filed to address the analment section so
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
again we don't have the conversation on
 
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
over but I think for our recommendation
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
we're just punting one do that does that
 
03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
we're just punting one do that does that
make

03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:08:44.590 --> 03:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
sense again doesn't stop anybody who
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
currently has conviction on their record
 
03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
if this law was a pass to file a
 
03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
petition and do it anyway and the court
 
03:08:51.309 --> 03:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
may or may not Grant it all right moving
 
03:08:53.670 --> 03:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
on uh assessment education tax all this
 
03:08:56.269 --> 03:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
says is that the standard uh State
 
03:08:58.349 --> 03:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
assessment of tax for Education trust
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
fund for the Statewide education
 
03:09:03.309 --> 03:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
property tax is $363 million annually um
 
03:09:05.229 --> 03:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
and this says that going forward it will
 
03:09:08.110 --> 03:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
be $363 million less the appropriation
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
that we made of the funds in the uh in
 
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
the in the revenue stream
 
03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
that number that number is still correct
 
03:09:18.190 --> 03:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
that's all correct that's still correct
 
03:09:20.349 --> 03:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
so any there was no changes recommended
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
there um use of the cannabis for
 
03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:25.229 align:start position:0%
there um use of the cannabis for
therapeutic

03:09:25.229 --> 03:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
purposes so sections 17 through 24 is
 
03:09:32.710 --> 03:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
all just to clarify is all language that
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
was added to make sure that op that atcs
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to convert to for
 
03:09:39.510 --> 03:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
profit status okay so sections 17
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
through 24 so 17 through 24 all the
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
language were just added to allow atcs
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
to move from a not for-profit status to
 
03:09:48.229 --> 03:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
a for-profit status any objection in
 
03:09:48.239 --> 03:09:49.790 align:start position:0%
a for-profit status any objection in
that

03:09:49.790 --> 03:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
language I thought we were going to
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
allow them to sorry file for a
 
03:09:58.389 --> 03:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
franchise right but in order to be to to
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
have their same company now be a
 
03:10:01.630 --> 03:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
franchise right because we have an LLC
 
03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
underneath that they need to be go moved
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
to a for-profit model and so that's what
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
this allows for is them to be able to do
 
03:10:09.070 --> 03:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
that correct because otherwise they
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to participate in
 
03:10:14.710 --> 03:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
detail all right so so um moving on to
 
03:10:18.510 --> 03:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
section 25 liquor investigation training
 
03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
um there looks like there was no
 
03:10:27.309 --> 03:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.790 --> 03:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:36.670 --> 03:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
36 it doesn't look like there was any
 
03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:38.630 align:start position:0%
36 it doesn't look like there was any
language

03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
there um it looks like this is new
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
language at the bottom for appropriation
 
03:10:45.229 --> 03:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
for department of safety for the purpose
 
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
of generating that report that uh we
 
03:10:53.229 --> 03:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.349 --> 03:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
bill yep and then we appropriate some
 
03:10:58.830 --> 03:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
money to liquor um out of the current
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
budget for uh purposes of Ru making and
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
all the stuff they have to do that we're
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
asking them to
 
03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
do do we know where in the bill because
 
03:11:09.309 --> 03:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
I have I I can't find it where in the
 
03:11:10.750 --> 03:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill we were keeping track of the
 
03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
fatalities in CarX do we was that report
 
03:11:14.870 --> 03:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the report requirement let me see
 
03:11:17.670 --> 03:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
if I can find it was back here was the
 
03:11:28.990 --> 03:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:31.349 --> 03:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
about all right I'm G have to find it
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
for you you know I just wanted to make
 
03:11:35.429 --> 03:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
sure that that stat was included that's
 
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
what that this is the money for them to
 
03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
generate that
 
03:11:40.830 --> 03:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
report and then money for liquor to be
 
03:11:43.150 --> 03:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
able to do the startup um before they
 
03:11:50.070 --> 03:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:53.389 --> 03:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
in all right any so that's the language
 
03:11:55.150 --> 03:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill we have one major topic to
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
discuss and that's the creation of the
 
03:11:59.910 --> 03:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
advisory commission for uh cannabis
 
03:12:09.870 --> 03:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.670 --> 03:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
um what's
 
03:12:11.680 --> 03:12:15.190 align:start position:0%
um what's
that

03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:41.640 --> 03:52:05.630 align:start position:0%
 
think

03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
items take up um the first we're going
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
to we're going to take up is the
 
03:52:12.870 --> 03:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
advisory the Cannabis advisory
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
commission um and we need to talk about
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
um that is you know all the conditions
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
of that commission who is attached to
 
03:52:23.229 --> 03:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
which is obviously liquor the makeup of
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
that committee who we want on that
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
committee and some of the basic roles
 
03:52:27.950 --> 03:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and functions of that
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee where is that going to go it's
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a whole new section somewh I
 
03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
don't know where but it's going to be a
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
whole so this is I think this is a place
 
03:52:37.590 --> 03:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
to start this is the the starting kind
 
03:52:40.189 --> 03:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
of language um um so we're creating a c
 
03:52:41.950 --> 03:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to call it but cannabis
 
03:52:43.790 --> 03:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
Public Health advisory commit uh
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee convened by The Liquor
 
03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
Commission charged with making
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations on public health issues
 
03:52:54.429 --> 03:52:54.439 align:start position:0%
such as or M making issues including but
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
not limited to THC potency limits for
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis products and serving sizes
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
packaging labeling marketing and
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
advertising standards to prevent
 
03:53:03.070 --> 03:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
targeting to minors this advisory
 
03:53:04.189 --> 03:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
committee is not intended to make
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations on cannabis business
 
03:53:09.469 --> 03:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
related issues so again so again the one
 
03:53:10.710 --> 03:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
I was asked to remind everybody to turn
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
their mics on when they SP speak because
 
03:53:14.830 --> 03:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's people listening in in the
 
03:53:16.110 --> 03:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
digital world that can't hear us when
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking um so let's start with a
 
03:53:22.510 --> 03:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
simple roles of responsibilities so what
 
03:53:25.149 --> 03:53:25.159 align:start position:0%
is going to be the primary um
 
03:53:26.670 --> 03:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility I think it's not just
 
03:53:28.830 --> 03:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
Public Health I think it's the overall
 
03:53:31.630 --> 03:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
operations of the Cannabis retail model
 
03:53:33.149 --> 03:53:33.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's relevant to Public Health
 
03:53:34.750 --> 03:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's relative to law enforcement
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
whether it's relative to enforcement
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
mechanisms um packaging and labeling I
 
03:53:41.630 --> 03:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
think it's a a little bit bigger myself
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't want to limit it to
 
03:53:44.790 --> 03:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
Public Health because there could be a
 
03:53:46.349 --> 03:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
very narrow definition of Public Health
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that we want we want
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
them to be advising the commission on
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
how to manage this new function that
 
03:53:55.110 --> 03:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing my opinion up to comments
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
for oh is that does that sound
 
03:54:00.670 --> 03:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
so their their role will be Public
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
Health right and I think in within that
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a subsection and that when
 
03:54:08.950 --> 03:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
when we are saying Public Health we are
 
03:54:11.149 --> 03:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
saying we want I I want to include all
 
03:54:12.870 --> 03:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
these things so we can Define Public
 
03:54:14.790 --> 03:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
Health what that is well not de not
 
03:54:17.229 --> 03:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
decline not Define Public Health but
 
03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
include within that bucket what we want
 
03:54:22.590 --> 03:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
them to look at so look at Public Health
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
public health component there a law
 
03:54:26.590 --> 03:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement enforcement component or
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'll just say enforcement regulatory so
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
you guys uh I appreciate the efficiency
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
you're working with but you guys
 
03:54:35.550 --> 03:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
mind I'll give it to you when I write it
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
up I'll write it up for you and give it
 
03:54:38.670 --> 03:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
to you once I'm done and you can just
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
want we're not saying where in the bill
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
it's going to go but um all right so we
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
have uh we have and then we have three
 
03:54:53.870 --> 03:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
the the business operations component so
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is the charge of the commission
 
03:55:00.550 --> 03:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
yep so three main charges Public Health
 
03:55:00.560 --> 03:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
yep so three main charges Public Health
enforcement

03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory um advis you know opinions
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh business operative
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
operations uh as well is there anything
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
else for big big buckets that we can we
 
03:55:13.269 --> 03:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
can define those a little bit better but
 
03:55:14.870 --> 03:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
ough for big buckets does that sound
 
03:55:16.469 --> 03:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
like we what we want this advisory
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
soon all right so given those big
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
buckets which we'll talk about uh Public
 
03:55:28.309 --> 03:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
Health enforcement Regulatory and then
 
03:55:30.469 --> 03:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
business operations they'll discuss
 
03:55:31.870 --> 03:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
those things in the advisory commission
 
03:55:33.990 --> 03:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
to make recommendations on this new
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
model um what what they and ongoing
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
they'll make recommendations so my
 
03:55:40.030 --> 03:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation is this is an ongoing
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
commission this isn't just a startup
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
commission so this is once they'll meet
 
03:55:46.349 --> 03:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
minimum once a year right at a minimum
 
03:55:48.269 --> 03:55:48.279 align:start position:0%
right just to make sure that or as
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
necessary um and they'll they'll deal
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing science is going to change
 
03:55:55.269 --> 03:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
business opportunities going to change
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
there be lots of enforcement may change
 
03:55:59.910 --> 03:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and allow them to meet regularly so
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
they'll meet annually at at minimally
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
once a
 
03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:06.439 align:start position:0%
year you have to write that in there yes
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
because I found out I was on a
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
commission on the chair and I never
 
03:56:10.269 --> 03:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
called a meeting CU I didn't know I was
 
03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
on it so uh I never got the notice so I
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
think that by calling out that they're
 
03:56:17.030 --> 03:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
responsible and well when we break it
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
out um my recommendation is we identify
 
03:56:21.870 --> 03:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
whoever the person is probably at the
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
the liquor enforcement the liquor uh
 
03:56:26.070 --> 03:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative will be responsible of
 
03:56:27.950 --> 03:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
calling the meeting when necessary at
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
least once a year and that way we know
 
03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
who's responsible regardless of who the
 
03:56:33.389 --> 03:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
chairman may be we have one person
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
designated to call a meeting and make
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
sure there's a meeting called all right
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
um who do you want on
 
03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
it Chief I would recommend a
 
03:56:45.189 --> 03:56:45.199 align:start position:0%

uh appointed by the Chiefs Association
 
03:58:15.710 --> 03:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
we have a public health official we
 
03:58:17.149 --> 03:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
haven't identified with that was we have
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
a medical person and I'm going to say
 
03:58:19.790 --> 03:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's by the New Hampshire Medical
 
03:58:22.630 --> 03:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
Society can I can I make the suggestion
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe it's the same makeup as this
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
commission plus an ADV a little bit
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
unwielding yeah with the number of us
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
that are here that that are in different
 
03:58:34.630 --> 03:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
position my thought is you're going to
 
03:58:37.510 --> 03:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
be trying to develop rules regulations
 
03:58:39.349 --> 03:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
policies and and all this other stuff
 
03:58:42.790 --> 03:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
and this many people not working out now
 
03:58:46.030 --> 03:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm I hope we can keep it to nine I'm
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
hoping we can keep it no more than nine
 
03:58:48.950 --> 03:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
people there's a reasonable number we're
 
03:58:52.630 --> 03:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
already up to five Dave perhaps somebody
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
from um
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
education due to the fact uh they'll
 
03:58:59.790 --> 03:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
they'll know whether or not what's going
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
on in the
 
03:59:03.550 --> 03:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
schools so want to point the of the uh
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.439 --> 03:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to I'm going to recommend
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
we have at least one Senator and one
 
03:59:16.110 --> 03:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
representative on it because if there's
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that come out that
 
03:59:18.830 --> 03:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
aren't rules or anything else you need
 
03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
someone to be act as a as a champion for
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
those to move them
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
forward so seven and eight we have one
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
more position if we keep it to nine we
 
03:59:30.349 --> 03:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
have a senator and a rep sorry to
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
potentially throw a wrench Just one
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
thought is you know I think kind of the
 
03:59:36.910 --> 03:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
the global or the the broad um mandate
 
03:59:38.750 --> 03:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
that I think it sounds like we're trying
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
to put on this group maybe a little bit
 
03:59:42.750 --> 03:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
too broad I think you know liquor has
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
expertise in enforcement already liquor
 
03:59:48.070 --> 03:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
has expertise in the business side but
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
where there is like where I think um and
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think new fatures original
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation came from was a
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
recognition that on the public health
 
03:59:57.830 --> 03:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
side of this and how marijuana and
 
03:59:59.070 --> 03:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
public health intersect and how to
 
04:00:00.590 --> 04:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
create good policy was a place where
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
there was potentially a gap and so the
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
need to create um a new kind of discreet
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
advisory body to fill that Gap um and so
 
04:00:12.790 --> 04:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
I guess a concern is that like we're
 
04:00:15.149 --> 04:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
creating too broad of a entity without a
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
clear mandate when we when there's
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
already expertise in two of the three
 
04:00:21.630 --> 04:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
areas within liquor um and so my
 
04:00:23.710 --> 04:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be like I I like what
 
04:00:25.550 --> 04:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
new features had put together and so my
 
04:00:27.149 --> 04:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be whether it'd be
 
04:00:28.590 --> 04:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
worth trying to kind of narrow in and
 
04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
focus on that original mandate so I I I
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
would tend to disagree because the argu
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
argument we're going to have is okay
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
Public Health let's talk about that does
 
04:00:40.149 --> 04:00:40.159 align:start position:0%
that include the
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
labeling I right but does that include
 
04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
labeling does that how would that deal
 
04:00:48.149 --> 04:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
with you know one of the things we
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
talked about here is suspension of lure
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that if there's an
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
injustice happening within liquor who's
 
04:00:55.229 --> 04:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
going to be the advisory panel to bring
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
that up to liquor and say this is not
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
being enforced evenly or anything else
 
04:01:00.990 --> 04:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
if there's a complaint right the whole
 
04:01:02.429 --> 04:01:02.439 align:start position:0%
point of this commission this this
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
advisory commission is the we need to
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
advise you on all aspects of what you're
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
doing and how that would work um because
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's a brand new brand new topic and a
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
brand new um business model and so what
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
is that who's we have so to do that
 
04:01:18.630 --> 04:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
because it is such a big thing we have
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
public health we have enforcement we've
 
04:01:23.950 --> 04:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
got things about education um to do that
 
04:01:28.149 --> 04:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
um so this this commission
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
just I think before you start appointing
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
members to it you want to figure out
 
04:01:35.229 --> 04:01:35.239 align:start position:0%
what's before we start naming who's on
 
04:01:37.670 --> 04:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
the commission we really want to narrow
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
the scope what the charge of the
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
commission is and from that point it you
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
you I think you can what Senator Whitley
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
said use kind of what we have now this
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
but you can cut down some of the refs in
 
04:01:52.710 --> 04:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
Senators right there's only one of each
 
04:01:55.469 --> 04:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
I think by doing that to the CH point
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is a large commission we've been
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
kind of banging heads but if you kind of
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
limit this corner over here I think it
 
04:02:02.910 --> 04:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
will work right sen whitle yeah I would
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
agree that because a lot of the our work
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know around the state control model
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
was to focus on public health that's why
 
04:02:14.750 --> 04:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think if we have a an advisory
 
04:02:17.469 --> 04:02:17.479 align:start position:0%
committee focused on public health you
 
04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
know that way you know we we can be the
 
04:02:21.910 --> 04:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
leader on this issue which is the whole
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
intention behind the state control model
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
that we are the leaders on the public
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
health side I think there's so much to
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
look at on the public health side all
 
04:02:31.630 --> 04:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
all of which you know we can Define you
 
04:02:34.990 --> 04:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
know like labeling um you know this
 
04:02:38.309 --> 04:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
public awareness campaign um potency
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
levels there's just so much on the
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
public health side that needs
 
04:02:45.429 --> 04:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
continuing you know A continuing look at
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
because of the science changes I think
 
04:02:50.070 --> 04:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
it becomes too unwieldy if you have you
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
know this again I don't I don't think
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
that's necessary that's why I said nine
 
04:02:55.950 --> 04:02:55.960 align:start position:0%
we limited to nine which is a reasonable
 
04:02:57.710 --> 04:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee it's not unwieldy in terms of
 
04:03:00.189 --> 04:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
the number of people it's unwieldy in
 
04:03:02.189 --> 04:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of issues that's why
 
04:03:04.149 --> 04:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
I think the most important thing that we
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
need advice on is public health because
 
04:03:09.790 --> 04:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
changes so much and because we know we
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
have heard the impact you know that
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
legalization will have because there's
 
04:03:15.790 --> 04:03:15.800 align:start position:0%
science involved that's what we really
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
need the advice on so as I'm laying this
 
04:03:22.870 --> 04:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
out right now four of the nine um
 
04:03:25.349 --> 04:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
appointees are all in the public health
 
04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
sphere right and then you have two
 
04:03:31.870 --> 04:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
legislators and then you've got liquor
 
04:03:33.389 --> 04:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
right who just talk about how it's GNA
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
how how it works and have that input
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
into the committee to be able to be a
 
04:03:38.189 --> 04:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
member of the committee to be able to
 
04:03:40.269 --> 04:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
speak about how operations work how
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
things look what the current rules and
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
regulations are to be able to speak
 
04:03:45.189 --> 04:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
authoritatively when it meets and you
 
04:03:46.630 --> 04:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
have one law enfor only one law
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement person on it to talk about
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
how uh that's being managed and dealt
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
with you know what is the you say public
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
health and I'd argue okay fine so DUI is
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
that a public health issue public
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
consumption is that a public health
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
issue right but that's an Enforcement
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
issue to me but it's also a public
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
health issue and so why shouldn't we
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
have a cop on there what about the
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office have to give
 
04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
you well that's job my good
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
for so
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
so you know we had this conversation
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
actually in a previous a previous
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
meeting and we decided we don't want to
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
be overly intrusive in terms of what the
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is going to do they
 
04:04:26.550 --> 04:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
are going to be The Regulators they are
 
04:04:27.990 --> 04:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to be the one that is responsible
 
04:04:29.790 --> 04:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
for doing a whole heck of a lot in
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
implementation of this model so we don't
 
04:04:34.070 --> 04:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
want to over legislate in terms of
 
04:04:36.269 --> 04:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
telling them what to do they are
 
04:04:38.229 --> 04:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
responsible and we are delegated that
 
04:04:40.590 --> 04:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
authority to them but they are not the
 
04:04:42.309 --> 04:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
public out and I don't think they would
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
claim to be and so the sort of middle of
 
04:04:44.960 --> 04:04:45.670 align:start position:0%
claim to be and so the sort of middle of
the

04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:49.870 --> 04:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
ground uh solution was to just create
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
this public health advisory committee I
 
04:04:55.149 --> 04:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
think um and it I don't know if the
 
04:04:56.429 --> 04:04:56.439 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission wants to speak to that
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
too that sort of that sort of balance of
 
04:05:00.750 --> 04:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
over regulate or over being overly
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptive yet also wanting to provide
 
04:05:04.149 --> 04:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
the support that you may need on the
 
04:05:06.469 --> 04:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
public health
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
side senator I would agree with you that
 
04:05:11.030 --> 04:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
the public health side is the side of
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
the business that uh we are uh less
 
04:05:18.189 --> 04:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
inclined to have knowledge of so we want
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can run the
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
business and run it uh efficiently and
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
profitably and my idea of this committee
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
would be uh someone to call we call
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
these meetings we have ideas we have
 
04:05:33.950 --> 04:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
concerns or someone that's on the
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
committee has ideas and concerns and the
 
04:05:37.950 --> 04:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
public health piece would be the most
 
04:05:41.070 --> 04:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
most important piece for us we
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
agree and so again so the question is
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
like but where where would public
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
consumption fall into that is that a
 
04:05:48.990 --> 04:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
public health piece do you think we
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
should have law enforcement involved in
 
04:05:50.199 --> 04:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
should have law enforcement involved in
that

04:05:51.990 --> 04:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:53.710 --> 04:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
discussion right and so that's why
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
they're member I I'm putting them down
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
as a member of the committee right
 
04:05:58.149 --> 04:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
because it is a public health issue mean
 
04:06:00.030 --> 04:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
right how is enforcement happening in in
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
in the law again they're advising on how
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
this model is working then they need to
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
make recom do they need to make
 
04:06:08.030 --> 04:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation that's
 
04:06:09.670 --> 04:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
why I'm think you need one Senator and
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
one House member is to be able to bring
 
04:06:13.389 --> 04:06:13.399 align:start position:0%
forward things that are Beyond rules but
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed or piece of the law
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
that needs to be changed because liquor
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
is operating under a model because
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they interpret the law to
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
read and so you need legislators on
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
there so I mean the only
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
person now we have again a public health
 
04:06:28.910 --> 04:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
official which we haven't defined right
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
what that is who that is exactly a New
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society bring in
 
04:06:34.950 --> 04:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
science we've got new Futures to bring
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
in public policy um arguments we have
 
04:06:40.110 --> 04:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
have uh the uh at app Point D of
 
04:06:42.030 --> 04:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to deal with how
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's impacting Youth and what's going on
 
04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
in our schools as this new policy does
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
then we have a senator state
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm going to
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
recommend for the ninth person one
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
lensey someone who's licensed to be able
 
04:06:54.110 --> 04:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
to come in to talk about how it actually
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
works um we may have a perception how it
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
works but having a ly on there may give
 
04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
us insight into public policy and how
 
04:07:02.429 --> 04:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
implementation might work but that's
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
just me
 
04:07:06.630 --> 04:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
Tim I mean why why does it need to be a
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative from new fure futes we we
 
04:07:10.110 --> 04:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
hear a lot from them all over the state
 
04:07:11.469 --> 04:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
already why don't we bring in some new
 
04:07:13.349 --> 04:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
blood and get fresh ideas that that
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
might work well and I'm okay just saying
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
public member appointed by the governor
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
and leaving it the governor can pick a
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
public a person who is representative
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
for them to bring in and not specify new
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
Futures specifically um and just say one
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
public member appointed by the
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
governor and they bring a general it
 
04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
could be a private citizen that comes in
 
04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
and has concerns or impact or could be a
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
policy wonk that the governor think
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
so is there a department of a component
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
to this in any way with obviously when
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
you start getting into testing a product
 
04:07:51.870 --> 04:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
and things like that if if these
 
04:07:53.550 --> 04:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
products are to be grown in New
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does that involve is that
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
under some perview of Department of AG
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
in any way or so right now testing is as
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
we we're talking about a relative to a
 
04:08:07.109 --> 04:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
third party testing at this point as as
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
administered by The Liquor
 
04:08:13.109 --> 04:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
Commission Chief Senator I I have to
 
04:08:16.149 --> 04:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
disagree with you about a member of the
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
people selling
 
04:08:20.269 --> 04:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
it you wouldn't bring someone producing
 
04:08:24.109 --> 04:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
tobacco in an oversight committee for
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco I'm okay with that I think I
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
think there's got to be a separation
 
04:08:29.790 --> 04:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
there a conflict there
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure right you could bring them in and
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
ask them for input
 
04:08:36.349 --> 04:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
but just so I'll strike that one I'll
 
04:08:37.269 --> 04:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
just say one member of the public
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
appointed by the government it it does
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
need to be a balance though because what
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
looks good on paper doesn't always work
 
04:08:47.469 --> 04:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
in the real world all right and what one
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
of the things I I've been critical of
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of the rules that exist now on
 
04:08:54.590 --> 04:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
paper they're they look Rock Solid but
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
when it comes to enforcing that rule and
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
how does that rule impact the
 
04:09:03.389 --> 04:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
franchisees I mean again they make a
 
04:09:05.790 --> 04:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation legisl going to pass that
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
and adopt that that's a different story
 
04:09:09.469 --> 04:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to make sure you
 
04:09:13.229 --> 04:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
have every angle you're cover you want
 
04:09:14.429 --> 04:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
you want the Chiefs on there you want
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
law enforcement on there to make sure
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
hey we can enforce this rule we can
 
04:09:19.229 --> 04:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
enforce that law we can enforce that
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
policy right realistically speaking
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
right same thing will that policy even
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
will that imp how will that impact the
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
franchisees is that something that they
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
they think will be too
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
burdensome you know they're going to be
 
04:09:33.429 --> 04:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
they're sitting in the room anyway the
 
04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
whole time they'll be testifying whether
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
they're on the commission or I don't
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's ch their input but I I think it's
 
04:09:41.309 --> 04:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
important to have everyone
 
04:09:43.469 --> 04:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
involved if I could if I could ask
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be covered under the Lial
 
04:09:48.389 --> 04:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
commission though wouldn't since aren't
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
they representing in some ways as the
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
main franchiser wouldn't they be
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
representing those logistical
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
issues again I'm I'm okay with taking
 
04:09:59.469 --> 04:09:59.479 align:start position:0%
off the person from the LIC I just added
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
CU I had ninth slot and I was trying to
 
04:10:02.910 --> 04:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
figure who I who was a good I have an
 
04:10:05.349 --> 04:10:05.359 align:start position:0%
idea and I'm okay with recommending just
 
04:10:06.590 --> 04:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
a member of the public as appointed by
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
the governor and just leave at that so
 
04:10:09.950 --> 04:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
it could be just a regular old taxpayer
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
if Governor thinks we need a policy wonk
 
04:10:13.389 --> 04:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
he can appoint a policy wonk two
 
04:10:19.349 --> 04:10:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.109 --> 04:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
house now we 10 so that means we got to
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
go to 11 so we don't have
 
04:10:27.070 --> 04:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
time um yes sen Whitley I just I'm a
 
04:10:28.469 --> 04:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
little nervous we don't have enough
 
04:10:30.070 --> 04:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
Public Health on there so we need a
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
certified public health
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
specialist so we have what again what we
 
04:10:36.990 --> 04:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
really need advice on is potency limit
 
04:10:39.429 --> 04:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
these pain labeling this is like the
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty thing so we need that
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
expertise on there right so certified
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
public health all right
 
04:10:49.630 --> 04:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
so did you have somebody on there from
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
prevention I just actually so I I
 
04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
crossed out the public health official I
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
said the public health official has
 
04:10:57.109 --> 04:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
appointed by the chairman of your
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
commission the commission on treatment
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
prevention substance yeah so you'll have
 
04:11:05.070 --> 04:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
one member from your commission on that
 
04:11:07.550 --> 04:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
on there as well as a pointed by may not
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
from your commission you may choose to
 
04:11:10.510 --> 04:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
pick somebody else but it's appointed by
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
the chairman of your commission so one
 
04:11:13.710 --> 04:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
other group I think that we have
 
04:11:15.109 --> 04:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
included which we've heard a lot about
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
is mental health and so potentially Nami
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
or a group like Nami to make sure that
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
right hampire Medical Society okay um
 
04:11:41.710 --> 04:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
I will say with this commission um I
 
04:11:43.109 --> 04:11:43.119 align:start position:0%
think we're pretty close on it but
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
there's some things that we need we need
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
to get to I
 
04:11:51.469 --> 04:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
think so I still need a definition of
 
04:11:53.309 --> 04:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
what is a public health person and who's
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
the appointing authority certified
 
04:11:57.790 --> 04:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
public health specialist That's like a
 
04:11:57.800 --> 04:11:58.830 align:start position:0%
public health specialist That's like a
an

04:11:58.830 --> 04:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
actual you know of course we want
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
someone certified in that area the
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
certified public health specialist
 
04:12:04.800 --> 04:12:06.269 align:start position:0%
certified public health specialist
appointed

04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
by DHHS
 
04:12:13.070 --> 04:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS Public Health certified public
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
health specialist appointed by
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS and then I'm okay because we have
 
04:12:19.389 --> 04:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
one more slot I got to fill because now
 
04:12:21.550 --> 04:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
we're at 10 we can't have an even number
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and so we can do the 11th member
 
04:12:26.590 --> 04:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
could be the commissioner Department of
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
Health need Services order designate
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
does that work for oh DHHS DHHS right
 
04:12:33.790 --> 04:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
that make sense to
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
everybody so chairman I just want for
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
the record to make sure this is is an
 
04:12:39.950 --> 04:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
advisory it is an advisory committee its
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
goal is to take topics and make
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations to The Liquor Commission
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
changes so a couple other issues we have
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
to address this is this is on the same
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
topic no let's finish up this and then
 
04:12:57.790 --> 04:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
before we move on I don't want we still
 
04:12:59.309 --> 04:12:59.319 align:start position:0%
how much because the commission's taken
 
04:13:01.469 --> 04:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
up a lot of time but that's that's
 
04:13:04.630 --> 04:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
important piece for some people so are
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
we okay with this commission to break up
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
11 people the members are the
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%

designate those are the 11 members
 
04:13:56.030 --> 04:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
making up the commission they have three
 
04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
big policy topics Public Health

04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
operations to advise the commission
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
on that good and we'll write all the
 
04:14:06.830 --> 04:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
filler language around it great now we
 
04:14:09.469 --> 04:14:09.479 align:start position:0%
can move on to another topic I have on
 
04:14:12.189 --> 04:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
the list um there was one piece that
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
should be without objection you all I
 
04:14:16.109 --> 04:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if you remember we had this
 
04:14:17.910 --> 04:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
piece that talked about distribution and
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
warehousing um and we all approved it
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
but it never made it actually into the
 
04:14:24.109 --> 04:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
bill so I'll give that to Daryl let just
 
04:14:25.710 --> 04:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
get that to include it adds a new
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
definition for a cannabis distributor
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that gets into
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as well we we had missed it on
 
04:14:35.510 --> 04:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the other thing no that's that's key but
 
04:14:38.830 --> 04:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
these on before people start taken off
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh there's a
 
04:14:42.990 --> 04:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
couple we'll call them deal breakers
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed so I think we
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
want to get to those soon as we can yep
 
04:14:49.229 --> 04:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
one of them being the issue of the
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
amount of stores yeah that's next on my
 
04:14:52.590 --> 04:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
list number of stores Dave I think you
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
had a comment on that
 
04:14:57.309 --> 04:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
yeah about the top of my head the way
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's currently written it it references
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
the no more than the amount of liquor
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
stores or something to that effect but
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
what I from the governor's office what
 
04:15:08.790 --> 04:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
we would recommend would be uh no more
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
than 15 stores and at sometime in the
 
04:15:14.670 --> 04:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
future after this thing gets up and
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
running if then more could either be
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
added or deleted just to see in relation
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
to how things progress how they worked
 
04:15:26.590 --> 04:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
well it didn't work Mr Mica you have a
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
comment on that limitation of cap on
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
stores at least to start off with and
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
then legislative change to grow beyond
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
that so they want to cap it at 15 stores
 
04:15:36.159 --> 04:15:38.910 align:start position:0%
that so they want to cap it at 15 stores
Statewide

04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
04:15:41.309 --> 04:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
I guess my only question would be how do
 
04:15:44.750 --> 04:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
the atc's fit into the 15
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
stores so if an ATC were to apply be to
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
for retail be to be a franchisee and if
 
04:15:55.469 --> 04:15:55.479 align:start position:0%
they were you know if they were selected
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
as the franchisee that would be one of
 
04:15:57.680 --> 04:15:59.510 align:start position:0%
as the franchisee that would be one of
the

04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
stores so they would have to apply for
 
04:16:05.149 --> 04:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
one of the 15 licenses yes that's fine
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
again ATC would have the option working
 
04:16:09.229 --> 04:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
in both mod working in one or the other
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
model so it could be a retail store sell
 
04:16:12.790 --> 04:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
its therapeutic product in the retail
 
04:16:16.149 --> 04:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
store and be a be governed by DHHS or it
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
could just stay a therapeutic store
 
04:16:20.550 --> 04:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
which case it's governed by DHHS if it
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
just stays as a therapeutic store we
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a great number to start
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
with thank you so you're okay with
 
04:16:30.229 --> 04:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
15 and before everyone just loses it I
 
04:16:32.109 --> 04:16:32.119 align:start position:0%
can I can I can see some of the people
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
with the great poker
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
faces listen this is a starting point
 
04:16:39.070 --> 04:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's not it could always a future
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
legisl could always address it but the
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
idea of compromise here and getting this
 
04:16:45.429 --> 04:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
the Finish Line that's that's the best
 
04:16:46.550 --> 04:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
number we
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
can you make it 20 it's not going to
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
work Jim I see a flaw with this you know
 
04:16:54.469 --> 04:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
we came to compromise and work with you
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
guys in good faith that we would never
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
exceed the number of liquor stores that
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
language allows for exceeding the number
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
of liquor stores no it's not the
 
04:17:04.109 --> 04:17:04.119 align:start position:0%
opposite no it's just the opposite it's
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
of the just 15 stores period just 15
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
stores not 65 but you're saying another
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
legislative body in the future could
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
raise that number if it it needs to have
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
the limit back and forth so you want to
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
leave that liit so hold on hold on John
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
so darl well but even as it was written
 
04:17:23.710 --> 04:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
before the future legisl could still
 
04:17:23.720 --> 04:17:24.630 align:start position:0%
before the future legisl could still
change

04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
it that that applies to every law other
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
than anything it's in the Constitution
 
04:17:34.030 --> 04:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
John I agree I I mean in terms of 15
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
just you cannot b a future leg
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
okay to put it in say if it don't exceed
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
64 it makes it sound like we're we're
 
04:17:46.349 --> 04:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
okay that to raise the number and then
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
beg the question well how you do that
 
04:17:49.550 --> 04:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
well the only way you can do it is
 
04:17:49.560 --> 04:17:50.510 align:start position:0%
well the only way you can do it is
through

04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:17:53.590 --> 04:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
legislation so don't sweat it the number
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
15 15 I can I can tell you from the
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
governor's office point of view that you
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
know we're at a minute about that number
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
15 can I just say we don't want to see a
 
04:18:05.870 --> 04:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
proliferation of what's happening in
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
other states okay Becky I just I I have
 
04:18:12.750 --> 04:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
a global sort of concern here is that we
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
just spent many many many many many many
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
many many months going through a 37 page
 
04:18:20.670 --> 04:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
document many people have to leave I
 
04:18:23.469 --> 04:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
have to leave at two and we are now
 
04:18:26.109 --> 04:18:26.119 align:start position:0%
going to take up a list of issues raised
 
04:18:29.229 --> 04:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
by the governor's office last night I I
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
feel like this is two issues most
 
04:18:33.109 --> 04:18:33.119 align:start position:0%
already actually been addressed there
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
only two issues as far as I know this is
 
04:18:36.269 --> 04:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
the one of the two there's a number of
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
stores a concern it just feels oh just
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
to to finish it feels very R rushed and
 
04:18:43.630 --> 04:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
a little inefficient to have spent
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
months and months on this language the
 
04:18:47.070 --> 04:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
various issues and then the very last
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
meeting the very last half hour to raise
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
these you know pretty substantial issues
 
04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take any public
 
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
testimony on this limitation I'm not
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
saying I I support it or I don't support
 
04:19:00.030 --> 04:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
it but we took all this public testimony
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
on these issues and we're going to raise
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
these issues at the very end without any
 
04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
public input I just I see that
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
procedurally as problematic particularly
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
because this is the legislative body
 
04:19:12.670 --> 04:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
so I can tell you to Governor all
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
conversations have been added about this
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
I I have brought it up uh I don't think
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's wise to leave the legislation that
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed the number of liquor
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
stores which would result in a
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
proliferation of pot shops all over the
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
state I think uh this is something that
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
we we got to move slowly on we want to
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that safety of the citizenry
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
is uh is taken care care of and as you
 
04:19:42.189 --> 04:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
said perhaps in the future when
 
04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
legislature could always uh change that
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
but at this this point we're adamant
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
about that number Mike do we have a a
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
locations so it's not new territory
 
04:20:07.630 --> 04:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
we're breaking new ground we're breaking
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's already been the model we're using
 
04:20:11.710 --> 04:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
with therapeutic uh now we just the
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
question is do we expand into retail to
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
allow for um more stores than we do for
 
04:20:20.109 --> 04:20:20.119 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic which is only eight
 
04:20:20.119 --> 04:20:22.429 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic which is only eight
so

04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
um they have have some issues with some
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
of the definitions just how the
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program would blend in but
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
we can do that we have one other
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
um policy issue let let's stick with the
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
15 let's stick with the 15 stores and
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
let's get that get that topic to who
 
04:20:40.070 --> 04:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
who's in favor of amending the bill to
 
04:20:44.670 --> 04:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
stores okay so that's the majority of
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
the committee so darl we draft that
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
language and again you'll need to insert
 
04:20:52.510 --> 04:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
it wherever we have the language
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
currently for I inserted it and we'll
 
04:20:57.750 --> 04:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
cap the number of stores of 15 it's
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:03.149 --> 04:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
3-f does he want to come to the mic when
 
04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
you come to the microphone so again so
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
people from this does not affect the
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
and there seven locations right I
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
understand my question this is my
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
question for you guys right you had 65
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
stores or whatever it was now we're down
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
to 15 you've projected uh the take for
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission to do this I can
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
tell you from someone that has a whole
 
04:21:27.550 --> 04:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of stores that you aren't going to
 
04:21:29.269 --> 04:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
collect the tax that you're projecting
 
04:21:32.349 --> 04:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
near in 15 stores it's not even possible
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
so you're setting up the Liquor
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
Commission potentially to fail by by
 
04:21:38.269 --> 04:21:38.279 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of stores that they
 
04:21:40.750 --> 04:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
start out with how many stores you think
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
we we would need 50 cuz we were 100 in
 
04:21:45.750 --> 04:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
Maine we're about the same size and it's
 
04:21:48.189 --> 04:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
been retracting right and we're down to
 
04:21:51.349 --> 04:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
about 80 but it's still not a healthy uh
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
situation for the for the population and
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
the customer base that we have I think
 
04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
50 stores now again I'm asking for
 
04:22:00.750 --> 04:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
competition for what I'd be looking for
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
but I'm just telling you how are you
 
04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:05.119 align:start position:0%
going to collect the tax that that Jim
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
and mik supposed to collect
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
if you got 15 stores they'd have to do
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
two3 million2 or3 million each a month
 
04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
in sales how long did it take for these
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
stores to open up from when the program
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
began it's not the stores that the
 
04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
problem it's the cultivation it takes
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
two years to build the cultivation out
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
of any sizable size and quality okay so
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
so this anyhow to be clear so again I
 
04:22:30.910 --> 04:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
think number one we're not talking about
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
cultivation licenses right we're talking
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
about retail store locations retail
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
operations right not and and when you
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
look at the geographical size of Maine
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
as compared to New Hampshire a
 
04:22:41.469 --> 04:22:41.479 align:start position:0%
significant difference as well as to why
 
04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
you may want more stores in Maine than
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
you want in New Hampshire because just
 
04:22:46.030 --> 04:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
getting from one end of main to the
 
04:22:48.030 --> 04:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
other you can't get there from here and
 
04:22:49.790 --> 04:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I think that there's a reason why
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
they might have more stores for access
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
to the community versus New Hampshire
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
they got 40 in one in Port in Portland
 
04:22:58.389 --> 04:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's just ridiculous we could do
 
04:22:59.950 --> 04:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
Portland with
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
one okay you guys know more about it
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
than me I wait go to represent H and
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
over here San the gon I was going to say
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
I think the basis of having this
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
conversation initially was because uh
 
04:23:14.109 --> 04:23:14.119 align:start position:0%
people were distressed that we were
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
losing money from our surrounding states
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
so 15 is better than zero and if and if
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
the whole premise is that we're losing
 
04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
so much money from Vermont Massachusetts
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
and and Maine in these sales then then
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
15 should be adequate to start with the
 
04:23:32.429 --> 04:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
model we haven't seen before Senator
 
04:23:35.309 --> 04:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
gon in my opinion and you can correct me
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong do you not do a
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
disproportionately high volume of
 
04:23:41.670 --> 04:23:41.680 align:start position:0%
business at a few stores so I'm thinking
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
if we have one on Route three 93 uh
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
Route One a few other places they're
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
going to do a predominantly large
 
04:23:49.870 --> 04:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the business so we're prudent
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
about our location of the 15 that's
 
04:23:53.550 --> 04:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true but then you guys
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
would have to dictate where the stores
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
go you you you understand that's what
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing but yeah
 
04:24:02.670 --> 04:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
again uh liquor always has that on
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
license EAS on location to decide where
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
stores go and don't so enough all right
 
04:24:10.189 --> 04:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
so as a as a consensus we had uh for a
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee we're okay
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
with adding language to cap the number
 
04:24:15.790 --> 04:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
of store locations at 15 again this
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
isn't breaking new ground we do it with
 
04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh the atc's we also do with charitable
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
gaming uh for um retail sports betting
 
04:24:24.590 --> 04:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
locations we're allowed 10 in the state
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
and that's it so it's not new ground
 
04:24:27.630 --> 04:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
that we're breaking where we've limited
 
04:24:30.429 --> 04:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
it on Startup to see what the impact was
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's a reasonable
 
04:24:32.479 --> 04:24:34.429 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's a reasonable
adjustment

04:24:34.429 --> 04:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
um the last one was do you want to do
 
04:24:39.309 --> 04:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
this one I I'll let you do it yeah
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
thanks um so we have some language out
 
04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office talking about
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
political contributions and lenses so
 
04:24:48.670 --> 04:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
I'd ask that everybody read it and we'll
 
04:24:50.950 --> 04:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
take some input on it um the language
 
04:24:52.510 --> 04:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
just says no recipient of a state
 
04:24:54.429 --> 04:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
licensed to operate a cannabis
 
04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
establishment shall Lobby or attempt to
 
04:24:57.630 --> 04:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
influence legislation relative to
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
cultivation testing manufacturer
 
04:25:00.750 --> 04:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
packaging or sale of cannabis or
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis products contribute funds to
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
any entity engaged in these activities
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
or participated in political activity
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
this prohibition shall not apply to
 
04:25:12.189 --> 04:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
entities that have not had a license for
 
04:25:13.469 --> 04:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
at least 18
 
04:25:16.910 --> 04:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
months so again the the uh that's the
 
04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
language that's being put forward I'm
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
open discussion I have a little concern
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
about Citizens United and that
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
conversation that speech is money is
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
speech and denying that might cause some
 
04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
conflict here but I'm open to discussion
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
before we get uh the Attorney General's
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
office weighs in
 
04:25:40.590 --> 04:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
the the franchisee purpose right you're
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
essentially acting as a government act
 
04:25:45.149 --> 04:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
so you can restrict speech on the
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
government but not on a private
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
individual so a franchisee I think this
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
you they're voluntarily deciding to
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
become a franchisee I don't think that's
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
a first am issue I guess for our friends
 
04:26:01.710 --> 04:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
sitting here and they're all all
 
04:26:04.670 --> 04:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
together are they would they be able
 
04:26:07.389 --> 04:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
this would apply to them perhaps
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
I guess I would ask Daryl is you name
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
one other place in State Statute where
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
we limit this for a private L LLC
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
because that's what these businesses are
 
04:26:17.309 --> 04:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
the private llc's in in uh a franchise
 
04:26:20.189 --> 04:26:20.199 align:start position:0%
arrangement with um with the state where
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
else in statute do we ever limit speech
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
by a private LLC well it's if they have
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to receive the state license to operate
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
a candidas
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
establishment like taking that I
 
04:26:33.309 --> 04:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
understand that you're saying that licy
 
04:26:36.070 --> 04:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
gives up that right uh let's go to Sen
 
04:26:38.030 --> 04:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
Whitley and then we go to Frank yeah so
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
I also have constitutional concerns with
 
04:26:41.710 --> 04:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
this first amendment concerns and just
 
04:26:43.269 --> 04:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
BEC these are private businesses that
 
04:26:46.269 --> 04:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
are getting uh you know they're getting
 
04:26:47.870 --> 04:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
a license they're getting a franchise
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make them government in no
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
way does it make that government um and
 
04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
so I you know again this is very rushed
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know folks have to leave very soon
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
this has potential constitutional
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
problems I think this is very this is
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
not right for decision point in such a
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
rushed way right now
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
Dave I I mean circumstances does happen
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
when somebody gets a A Federal
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
Grant and they're not recipients of
 
04:27:18.269 --> 04:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
federal grants a lot of times the
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
condition is they're not to do any
 
04:27:22.309 --> 04:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
lobbying or any of those type of
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
activities the the the the worry here is
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't want the to create a big
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco atmosphere in New Hampshire that
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
is happening in other states we we don't
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
want it to be where a lot of money is
 
04:27:38.269 --> 04:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
being thrown around we want it to we
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
it we don't want that to happen here
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
where uh the whole conversation is taken
 
04:27:46.990 --> 04:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
over by people with a lot of money you
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
heard the gentleman say uh he owns a lot
 
04:27:49.960 --> 04:27:50.590 align:start position:0%
heard the gentleman say uh he owns a lot
of

04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:53.349 --> 04:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
stores and he's going to have a unfair
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
Advantage if he's able to put up all
 
04:27:58.070 --> 04:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of Lobby activities where we are
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
trying to make this the one of the
 
04:28:00.550 --> 04:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
reasons we're trying to make this a
 
04:28:02.790 --> 04:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
franchise model is so we don't get a big
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco we don't get that big money
 
04:28:07.950 --> 04:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
coming into new Hampshire in polluting
 
04:28:09.750 --> 04:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
the conversation what's best for New
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire further conversation Frank I
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
definitely see the chief's um concern in
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
terms of influence I do think though we
 
04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
have potential First Amendment issues
 
04:28:21.990 --> 04:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
with this um I definitely want to run
 
04:28:24.429 --> 04:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
this by our legal team but I think that
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
I mean the chief's point I think is is
 
04:28:28.030 --> 04:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
why I think it's so important that we on
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
the commission like the commission that
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're establishing that we don't have
 
04:28:32.550 --> 04:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
certain people on that commission that
 
04:28:34.950 --> 04:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
we limit throughout other aspects of
 
04:28:37.389 --> 04:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
this legislation the power and influence
 
04:28:40.590 --> 04:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
of certain entities you know so that we
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
have like we decided not to put the a
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
member of franchisee on the oversight I
 
04:28:48.109 --> 04:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
think that's a great way to limit their
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
power ability to influence but I think
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
this has some potential issues Tim and
 
04:28:57.149 --> 04:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
then darl just a couple questions I
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
mean we don't limit um the opportunity
 
04:29:03.309 --> 04:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
to lobby for the gambling establishments
 
04:29:05.189 --> 04:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
that have licenses or any other kind of
 
04:29:07.710 --> 04:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
license I think this might possibly set
 
04:29:08.910 --> 04:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
a bad
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
precedence so let me let me just explain
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
one of the rationals for this I'm just
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
explain the rationale so you have 15
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
franchises right they may not agree on
 
04:29:22.159 --> 04:29:23.229 align:start position:0%
franchises right they may not agree on
every

04:29:23.229 --> 04:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
policy but they they're kind of
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
operating on I don't I don't know team's
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
the right word but they're operate you
 
04:29:31.710 --> 04:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
don't want picture other franchises
 
04:29:32.910 --> 04:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
right if they're all arguing amongst
 
04:29:34.670 --> 04:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
themselves lob being for different
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
things part of it is is trying to keep
 
04:29:39.750 --> 04:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
it keep some
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
cohesiveness amongst the franchises now
 
04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of how this came about
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
now is it an actual First Amendment
 
04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
violation uh I think if they agree to
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
take the state license they're doing so
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
in advance that's why it's you this
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
should not apply to the entities that
 
04:29:59.229 --> 04:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
have not had license for at least 18
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
months it's applying to anyone who
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
decides to apply for a license after the
 
04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
fact they do that that they know what
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
what goes along with that
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
license they're doing it voluntarily no
 
04:30:15.590 --> 04:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
one's no one's making anyone do anything
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
right long as they know it in advance
 
04:30:19.710 --> 04:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
now if we were to change do this five
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
years from now I don't think you can do
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
problematic further
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
discussion so let's do it this way all
 
04:30:35.309 --> 04:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
those in favor of adopting this language
 
04:30:38.030 --> 04:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
into to the bill somewhere signify by
 
04:30:40.469 --> 04:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:46.710 --> 04:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:48.670 --> 04:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
oppose it's four three with a whole
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
bunch of people not voting um for
 
04:30:52.750 --> 04:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
understandable reasons so why don't we
 
04:30:54.670 --> 04:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
do this as an addendum because it's not
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
a majority of the committee that's done
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
it so we'll do it as a talking point to
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
be added into the bill and the committee
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
report saying there was discussion about
 
04:31:03.389 --> 04:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
the influence of the industry uh through
 
04:31:06.910 --> 04:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying on expansion and um um and pro
 
04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
prohibiting that that lobbying efforts
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
and we can put some sort of note in the
 
04:31:13.630 --> 04:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
in the rest of the amendment to the bill
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
or the addendum to the bill can I can I
 
04:31:17.910 --> 04:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
just add that the last sentence is
 
04:31:20.389 --> 04:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
tortured language and can be drastically
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
improved if just when you had that in
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
the addendum you just put a little note
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
that someone really should look at that
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
last sentence and clean it
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
up all right what else do you have on
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
your list there I know our friends at
 
04:31:36.189 --> 04:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
the atcs
 
04:31:37.630 --> 04:31:37.640 align:start position:0%
had some issues with some of the
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
definitions of how it would be
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
coordinated so I was ask if they they
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
phhs I'll just bring it went up to speed
 
04:32:06.429 --> 04:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
during the lunch break we had a very
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
pleasant conversation about some of the
 
04:32:13.269 --> 04:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
like we're trying to balance some of
 
04:32:17.309 --> 04:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
these definition pieces together because
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
if if an ATC were to apply be a
 
04:32:21.070 --> 04:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
franchise he and be granted that and
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
they were to then close their
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
storefront how would that work with the
 
04:32:28.030 --> 04:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
rest of these rules and part of it is
 
04:32:30.269 --> 04:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
was maybe defining what a therapeutic
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
product is is not and where would that
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
go here also uh tweaking some of the
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
definition and of manufacturing stuff
 
04:32:41.229 --> 04:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
like that so we'll we'll take the let
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
you guys take the floor and explain that
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again for the
 
04:32:46.990 --> 04:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
record Matt Simon representing Granite
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
Leaf cannabis Y and uh good afternoon
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
everybody uh Brandon pic with tascal
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
Wellness thank
 
04:32:57.309 --> 04:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
you first of all thank you for listening
 
04:32:59.229 --> 04:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
to our previous testimony and reading
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
our previous memos had some good
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
conversations about how to integrate uh
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
the therap at cannabis program with uh
 
04:33:11.189 --> 04:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
the proposed franchise model um we're we
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
still you know I've read this a few
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
times today I'm still trying to make
 
04:33:16.750 --> 04:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
sense of uh some of some of the
 
04:33:16.760 --> 04:33:20.750 align:start position:0%
sense of uh some of some of the
provisions

04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
um the biggest problem was already fixed
 
04:33:25.709 --> 04:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh early this morning
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
when in uh on page five line 13 and 14
 
04:33:31.949 --> 04:33:31.959 align:start position:0%
the sentence reading alternative
 
04:33:33.949 --> 04:33:33.959 align:start position:0%
treatment centers cannot be licensed to
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
duly operate at the same location is a
 
04:33:38.109 --> 04:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
franchise cannabis retail outlet so that
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
was deleted this morning thank you for
 
04:33:43.470 --> 04:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
doing that that that gives us some
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
clarity and
 
04:33:49.269 --> 04:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
restores my understanding of overall
 
04:33:50.949 --> 04:33:50.959 align:start position:0%
what my understanding is and please
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong the atcs have
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
agreed uh to give up the store branding
 
04:34:00.910 --> 04:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
to no longer have branded
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
atc's uh if we do receive
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
franchise licenses we would operate the
 
04:34:08.429 --> 04:34:08.439 align:start position:0%
franchise but we would be able to
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
continue selling to patients and in fact
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
this would expand access because any
 
04:34:15.429 --> 04:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
franchise store would be able to sell
 
04:34:17.709 --> 04:34:17.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products to patients so to
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
be clear we think that's a good idea and
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
concept go right ahead rest that
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
apologize I I give one second he missed
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
the morning hecting that language I was
 
04:34:35.590 --> 04:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
late I apologize so we struck langu in
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
Striking that language under Roman num
 
04:34:41.551 --> 04:34:41.561 align:start position:0%
16 the that's part of the idea is that
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
you can't have the licensed ATC and a
 
04:34:46.590 --> 04:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
licensed franchisee operating at the
 
04:34:46.600 --> 04:34:48.029 align:start position:0%
licensed franchisee operating at the
same

04:34:48.029 --> 04:34:48.039 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:34:50.590 --> 04:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
location in a retail
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
capacity we weren't going to so by
 
04:34:53.240 --> 04:34:55.390 align:start position:0%
capacity we weren't going to so by
striking

04:34:55.390 --> 04:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
striking
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
that yeah I think we're just
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding each other Senator that
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
sentence wasn't in the previous draft of
 
04:35:02.910 --> 04:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
the bill it was a new surprise for us
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
this morning that we weren't super happy
 
04:35:06.910 --> 04:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
with and it promptly got deleted so
 
04:35:09.390 --> 04:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
we're we're back to a place of trying to
 
04:35:11.230 --> 04:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
make sense of what we do see in front of
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
us uh the section that goes along with
 
04:35:17.109 --> 04:35:17.119 align:start position:0%
this is uh being on page 12 and
 
04:35:19.230 --> 04:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding on to 13 there was a whole
 
04:35:21.869 --> 04:35:21.879 align:start position:0%
section of rulemaking on how
 
04:35:21.879 --> 04:35:23.029 align:start position:0%
section of rulemaking on how
specifically

04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
atc's would apply for and be licensed
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
and it included some restrictions that
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
patients I think are going to think are
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
very important that we continue serving
 
04:35:36.310 --> 04:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
patients and continue to
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
prioritize serving
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
patients um but in terms of process
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
there there's there's still some things
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're not clear about we thought a
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
definition of of therapeutic products
 
04:35:51.670 --> 04:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
and um sorry just to finish ask a quick
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
question of you so again I want to make
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
sure we're clear is that the issue is
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
that I think at some point once you
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
apply to be a retail store you're no
 
04:35:59.949 --> 04:35:59.959 align:start position:0%
longer acting as an ATC but the problem
 
04:36:01.830 --> 04:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
is with that sentence in there even the
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
ATC can't apply to be a retail store
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
because we were you were
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly prohibited from becoming a
 
04:36:09.470 --> 04:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
retail store that's why we struck that
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
language before right I understand that
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh we would still be doing all the
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
things we currently do to serve patients
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
we would still be cultivating and
 
04:36:18.390 --> 04:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
producing products we would still still
 
04:36:20.910 --> 04:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
be dispensing to patients we would still
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
be doing all the things that RSA 126x
 
04:36:26.590 --> 04:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
authorizes us to do and unless we change
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 126x we'll still be defined as atc's
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
under 126x so that's something that
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be cleaned up a little
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
bit uh and we're we're happy to spend
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
time in December and go through RSA 126x
 
04:36:41.349 --> 04:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
and make sure everything in there
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
comports with what this bill will be
 
04:36:47.949 --> 04:36:47.959 align:start position:0%
doing and clean up any of that um but I
 
04:36:50.349 --> 04:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
do think for the definition of franchise
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail outlet first of all we
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
need to make it clear currently it says
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh an entity licensed as a
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
franchisee uh to purchase cannabis from
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
Cannabis cultivation facilities purchase
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products from
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing facilities and sells
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis and cannabis products or
 
04:37:10.990 --> 04:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis accessories or paraphernalia to
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
Consumers and instead of ending on
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
consumers if the intent is for all
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
franchise stores to be able to sell to
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
adults uh you would need to add uh
 
04:37:21.310 --> 04:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
registered patients or qualifying
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
patients and designated caregivers so
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
that all retail franchise stores would
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
have that and Brandon has that
 
04:37:28.269 --> 04:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
definition yeah I'll just be a little
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
more precise so recommendation is after
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis product Manufacturing
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
facilities include uh purchase
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis products from
 
04:37:41.349 --> 04:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers that would
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
allow any of the franchise Outlets to
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
purchase the products and then also at
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
the end to uh sell Therapeutics
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis products to
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
qualified patients and their designated
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
caregivers uh we would also recommend a
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
definition of what a therapeutic
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis product is in the definition
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
section uh which would be a cannabis or
 
04:38:09.949 --> 04:38:09.959 align:start position:0%
cannabis product that's produced by an
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment
 
04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
center dosing and potency limits uh
 
04:38:18.429 --> 04:38:18.439 align:start position:0%
established under this chapter shall not
 
04:38:22.029 --> 04:38:22.039 align:start position:0%
apply to therapeutic cannabis products
 
04:38:25.230 --> 04:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
so those definition tweaks should tie
 
04:38:27.189 --> 04:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
into the intent here which is to allow
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
any franchise retail out to purchase and
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
sell therapeutic products to uh
 
04:38:33.920 --> 04:38:35.789 align:start position:0%
sell therapeutic products to uh
patients

04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:38:39.070 --> 04:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
so three three things number one is to
 
04:38:40.750 --> 04:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
adjust the franchise cannabis retail
 
04:38:42.189 --> 04:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
outlet definition to include the
 
04:38:44.629 --> 04:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
language you had to create create a
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
definition of what a therapeutic product
 
04:38:48.750 --> 04:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
is as compared to a retail product and
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
then lastly the third one what was the
 
04:38:51.349 --> 04:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
last one
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
again uh yeah basically I mean that's
 
04:38:56.590 --> 04:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
correct so the the franchise retail
 
04:38:58.470 --> 04:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
outlet definition would allow them to
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
both purchase and distribute the
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products create a definition
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic products and and then
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
the last minor thing the bottom of page
 
04:39:11.230 --> 04:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
10 um we would recommend changing the
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
term therapeutic grade to therapeutic
 
04:39:15.869 --> 04:39:15.879 align:start position:0%
cannabis products to match the
 
04:39:15.879 --> 04:39:19.750 align:start position:0%
cannabis products to match the
definition

04:39:19.750 --> 04:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so that's all least I got should
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
change therapeutic gra products to
 
04:39:26.760 --> 04:39:29.230 align:start position:0%
change therapeutic gra products to
therapeutic

04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
products yeah therap to canis probably
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
pick of title it doesn't
 
04:39:36.390 --> 04:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
matter so can you okay so let's let's
 
04:39:37.990 --> 04:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
talk in general right now and as the
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
commiss as the committee goes those
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments make sense in order be able
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
to allow the ATC to move over into the
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
retail Market does that sound like a
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable adjustment because of
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
definition changes we' got is there any
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
objection to that make sure I understand
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
what was having because we always said
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
they could be the cultivators for the
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
retail what I'm hearing what I'm hearing
 
04:40:04.400 --> 04:40:05.350 align:start position:0%
retail what I'm hearing what I'm hearing
is

04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:40:08.150 --> 04:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that when the this product is now in the
 
04:40:08.160 --> 04:40:09.628 align:start position:0%
that when the this product is now in the
retail

04:40:09.628 --> 04:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
retail
 
04:40:13.230 --> 04:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
environment that the same controls we
 
04:40:16.430 --> 04:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
have over the atc's Personnel in terms
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
of their training uh the product
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
labeling uh they still have to have that
 
04:40:27.670 --> 04:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
same the employees of the retail have to
 
04:40:30.550 --> 04:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
have that training I me I guess let me
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
is that what I'm hearing we already we
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
already put the training in for anybody
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
in the retail side we don't we're not
 
04:40:39.190 --> 04:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
changing the therapeutic side but the
 
04:40:42.350 --> 04:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm what I was thought I heard was that
 
04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the therapeutic
 
04:40:48.030 --> 04:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
product right that's what we're talking
 
04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
about here is the the product
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
itself obviously it can't exceed the
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
limits that are already in the
 
04:41:00.430 --> 04:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
retail right the five bgrs can't exceed
 
04:41:02.830 --> 04:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
that so even though therapeutic products
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
have very high dosages
 
04:41:07.590 --> 04:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
you can't exceed it in the retail
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
environment so the only thing this seems
 
04:41:14.910 --> 04:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
to tell me was that if the product is
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
provided to a retail
 
04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
outlet that you are saying they the
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
person who is selling or the person
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
who's marketing it has to have sound
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like have to have the ATC
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
training that's what I heard but maybe
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
I'm represent our our intent with the
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to allow any of the
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
franchise retail stores to
 
04:41:46.030 --> 04:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
sell therapeutic products which would be
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
higher potency and they could only be
 
04:41:51.230 --> 04:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
sold to patients or caregivers so yeah
 
04:41:53.788 --> 04:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
it allows you know more access points
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
for patients yes so that's to me a deal
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
breaker because I think when we sit here
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
and argue about how we want to have caps
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
to say okay but if somebody shows up
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.708 --> 04:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
then then now we have the same problem
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
fundamentally with the difference in my
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
mind between the
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
atc's and the retail is that the atc's
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
pay have no franchise
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
fee and have the sky a limit on your
 
04:42:27.868 --> 04:42:27.878 align:start position:0%
dosage whereas the retail has a
 
04:42:27.878 --> 04:42:29.150 align:start position:0%
dosage whereas the retail has a
franchise

04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
fee and yes there is a limit to how much
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
THC the product can
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
have respectfully representative hunt uh
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
You' missed a couple of meetings there
 
04:42:42.110 --> 04:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
have been a number of discussions that
 
04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
took place when you were not here and
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
the commission I believe did reach
 
04:42:48.150 --> 04:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
consensus and did agree that it would be
 
04:42:50.590 --> 04:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
desirable for franchise stores to be
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
able to serve to sell to patients
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
registered patients as well as adults
 
04:42:57.550 --> 04:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
and I see the chairman is nodding at a
 
04:42:57.560 --> 04:42:59.190 align:start position:0%
and I see the chairman is nodding at a
higher

04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
dosage so the idea and I'm just going to
 
04:43:04.990 --> 04:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
backtrack little bit the idea was can't
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
have two masters right that that was
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
your correct line so we have our atc's
 
04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
who are I from when I gather are
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
interested in in entering the retail
 
04:43:16.670 --> 04:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
Market no one's making them do it but
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
that's what they want to
 
04:43:20.110 --> 04:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
do initially they wanted to have a dual
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
license and two signs and all that and
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I I just want to hear what you guys
 
04:43:26.030 --> 04:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
agreed to well um the idea was if
 
04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
they're gonna operate a become a
 
04:43:30.670 --> 04:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
franchise e person that's assuming that
 
04:43:31.868 --> 04:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
they're app they could operate a
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
franchise right and then give up the ATC
 
04:43:37.230 --> 04:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
yes but the idea is what with you still
 
04:43:39.830 --> 04:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
have an ATC Market the idea was rather
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
than create an unfair Market Advantage
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
for you know some of the
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
franchises is that they would be able to
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
distrib any franchisee would have the
 
04:43:51.230 --> 04:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sell therapeutic products
 
04:43:53.788 --> 04:43:53.798 align:start position:0%
to patients but we're going to limit
 
04:43:56.230 --> 04:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to the existing
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers we're not going to have
 
04:44:00.270 --> 04:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
more at a higher dosage they could sell
 
04:44:02.190 --> 04:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
the higher dosage provide the person has
 
04:44:04.910 --> 04:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic card and is the
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
franchise fee still in effect or not yes
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
yes if it's in a retail store okay so
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
the difference is is they would can sell
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
higher dosage if they have a medical
 
04:44:16.470 --> 04:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
card therapeutic card and it still goes
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
towards the franchise for your and grow
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
sales okay but there if it's a if they
 
04:44:24.190 --> 04:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
choose to stay as a true ATC no retail
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
sale then they're not subject to the the
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
tax the the fee any kind of franchise Fe
 
04:44:31.470 --> 04:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
on that medical product
 
04:44:34.990 --> 04:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
okay represent uh just wonder if there's
 
04:44:37.310 --> 04:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
a stickup about the selling the higher
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
THC levels then would we then could we
 
04:44:42.590 --> 04:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
go back and look at the medical cards
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
and see that maybe the doctor has agreed
 
04:44:47.788 --> 04:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
that this person requires a higher THC
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
level so the interesting part about
 
04:44:54.990 --> 04:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
m a big can s big can of problems um so
 
04:44:57.230 --> 04:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
again the issue is around doctors don't
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
write a prescription they qualify you as
 
04:45:01.788 --> 04:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
having having a certain condition and by
 
04:45:04.708 --> 04:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
law we allow those people with those I
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to get medical what happens
 
04:45:08.190 --> 04:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
is they they tell you what you're they
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
give you they tell you what you're
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to have verb it's not really
 
04:45:12.390 --> 04:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
written down anymore no I understand I
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
there's no way to really enforce that R
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
so they more certify the underlying
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
condition that is that is legally able
 
04:45:19.310 --> 04:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
to have a card what's the justification
 
04:45:21.030 --> 04:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
for having higher THC levels on the
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
medical side then maybe it all gets
 
04:45:25.110 --> 04:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
brought down in
 
04:45:27.990 --> 04:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
general that's an option just the
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
thought all right so you guys all right
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
so in general
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
how how do you want to proceed we have
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
these definitions are necessary for the
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
atcs to be able to move from an ATC
 
04:45:44.310 --> 04:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
Market to a retail Market um and run a
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
retail shop um are we okay with the
 
04:45:48.510 --> 04:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
adoption of the general principle of
 
04:45:50.350 --> 04:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
adopting those we'll give it to Daryl to
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
be able to change those three conditions
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
we talked about right um adding the Lang
 
04:45:56.910 --> 04:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
adding the change in in the section
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
about the franchise cannabis retail
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
store um to clean up some language um to
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
deal with therapeutic um creating a
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
definition for the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then lastly I always forget what the
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
third one was any recommendation from
 
04:46:11.798 --> 04:46:15.910 align:start position:0%
third one was any recommendation from
our

04:46:15.910 --> 04:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
experts Mike do we have a definition
 
04:46:20.310 --> 04:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
what therapeutic cannabis is in
 
04:46:20.320 --> 04:46:23.070 align:start position:0%
what therapeutic cannabis is in
in

04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:46:26.110 --> 04:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
current yes anything they sell is a
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
theraputic product's no there's no
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
differentiation of adult product
 
04:46:36.990 --> 04:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
versus because there is no so aerape
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:46:40.320 --> 04:46:44.150 align:start position:0%
would be
anyc

04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.160 --> 04:46:47.070 align:start position:0%
 
manufactur

04:46:47.070 --> 04:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
manufactur
 
04:46:49.350 --> 04:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
ands so there's no differentiation
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in that law that would
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
allow us to differentiate between retail
 
04:46:54.910 --> 04:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
product and therapeutic product unless
 
04:46:56.390 --> 04:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
you guys have a definition that we can
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
use yeah so our recommendation with the
 
04:47:01.708 --> 04:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
you know seven minutes we just thought
 
04:47:04.830 --> 04:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
about it was to essentially
 
04:47:07.030 --> 04:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh preclude dosing and potency
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
restrictions from a therapeutic product
 
04:47:10.910 --> 04:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
so it's any you know it's any cannabis
 
04:47:13.750 --> 04:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
product that HC produces and that the
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
dosing and potency limits don't don't
 
04:47:17.670 --> 04:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
apply to those
 
04:47:17.680 --> 04:47:21.788 align:start position:0%
apply to those
products

04:47:21.788 --> 04:47:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
um so what we wrote was it means a
 
04:47:27.150 --> 04:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis or cannabis product produced by
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative treatment center dosing
 
04:47:32.548 --> 04:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
and potency limits established under
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall not apply apply to
 
04:47:39.868 --> 04:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
products I have a concern that we're
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
going to be creating a schizophrenic
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
system to where you know this booth
 
04:47:49.708 --> 04:47:49.718 align:start position:0%
sells this and that Booth sells this and
 
04:47:51.868 --> 04:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
if we have THC limits let's have THC
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
limits right so again I think the
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
concept was allowing the recreational
 
04:47:58.230 --> 04:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
the retail stores to be able to sell
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
therapeutic product as developed by the
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic industry um and be subject
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
to to what they give up is the fact that
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
it's subject to Taxation and you have to
 
04:48:08.190 --> 04:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
have a card you can't walk in and say I
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
want to buy the therapeutic and not have
 
04:48:11.830 --> 04:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
a card you have to have the card which
 
04:48:13.788 --> 04:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
means that you've met with Mike or gone
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
through the process with DHHS for for
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
what that looks like um and and but you
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
also can still have for again for an ATC
 
04:48:23.788 --> 04:48:23.798 align:start position:0%
that chooses not to and just wants to
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
stay in the not for profit World they
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
could just stay over there and sell just
 
04:48:29.590 --> 04:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic product and no retail
 
04:48:29.600 --> 04:48:31.708 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic product and no retail
product

04:48:31.708 --> 04:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
product
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
whatsoever just a q said quick question
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
question so if somebody comes in with a
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
medical cut
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
and do they get any do you get any
 
04:48:43.310 --> 04:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
direction from what their medical
 
04:48:45.628 --> 04:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
provider suggested recommended or they
 
04:48:46.990 --> 04:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
can just come in because they have the
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
medical card and say I want the highest
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
potency so as a matter of policy we can
 
04:48:56.430 --> 04:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
sell them anything on our menus uh in
 
04:48:58.548 --> 04:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
some cases a very small number of cases
 
04:49:00.548 --> 04:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
the medical provider does provide notes
 
04:49:03.190 --> 04:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
and does provide specific instructions
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
in cases where do uh we are required by
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
law to follow that and we do um
 
04:49:12.270 --> 04:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue that could be
 
04:49:13.708 --> 04:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
addressed in ruem that's one of the
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I was concerned about the
 
04:49:16.510 --> 04:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking being pulled out of this
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
draft uh but that can something we can
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
deal with in January perhaps um but yeah
 
04:49:23.708 --> 04:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
we we are required to follow the
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
providers instructions when they do
 
04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
provide instructions but the vast
 
04:49:29.948 --> 04:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
majority don't have instructions so it's
 
04:49:31.470 --> 04:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
the choice of the consumer with the
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
medical Cod that's correct thank
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
you further discussion and just so to
 
04:49:38.788 --> 04:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
clear that's how it is under the
 
04:49:43.230 --> 04:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
existing therapeutic program so yeah I
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the doctor's not allowed to write
 
04:49:47.590 --> 04:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
it down the patient just walks in and
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully he's honest with the with the
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
ATC they have the option although it's
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.840 --> 04:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
consultation

04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
requ APC to follow provider instruction
 
04:50:10.628 --> 04:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
correct but the doctor's not allowed to
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
put it in writing but he
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
said sometimes oh we heard different
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
testimony so da I mean he just not the
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
aru but this gentleman just said that
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
most of the time the doctor doesn't give
 
04:50:26.590 --> 04:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
him Str so I'm it just seems kind of
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
ironic it just as an observation it's
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a quasi medicine not a
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
prescription but and but the consumer
 
04:50:36.510 --> 04:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
chooses what his doses each other so
 
04:50:39.510 --> 04:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's cannabis is a unique product
 
04:50:40.948 --> 04:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are no lethal
 
04:50:44.910 --> 04:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses means that right I'll I'll
 
04:50:47.470 --> 04:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
just stop saying I'll stop talking so
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
again so the question is do we change
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
this language to deal with this
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
transitional issue we have with atcs
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
being able to get into the market we
 
04:50:56.670 --> 04:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
have some base definitions that we can
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
add we Daryl can send them around um to
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
everybody once he's drafted it and
 
04:51:02.310 --> 04:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
brought it into the bill well
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic grade cannabis products
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
means a cannabis product that ex which
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
is already
 
04:51:10.548 --> 04:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
defined that exceeds the potency
 
04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
limitations created by this
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
chapter and manufactured by a license
 
04:51:18.240 --> 04:51:21.948 align:start position:0%
chapter and manufactured by a license
ATC

04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:21.958 --> 04:51:25.190 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:51:25.190 --> 04:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.910 --> 04:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
right all
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
right so we're good with that those
 
04:51:31.070 --> 04:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
changes what darl do you have anything
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
else on your list of things we got to
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:34.548 align:start position:0%
else on your list of things we got to
address

04:51:34.548 --> 04:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:51:37.270 --> 04:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
because that's was the last one on my
 
04:51:37.280 --> 04:51:44.350 align:start position:0%
because that's was the last one on my
list

04:51:44.350 --> 04:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
um what's
 
04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
gummies all right anything else um I'm
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
waiting for Daryl to finish typing but
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
is anybody anybody other than Daryl have
 
04:52:00.350 --> 04:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
anything they want to bring up yep I
 
04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
would just with regard to the Cannabis
 
04:52:04.390 --> 04:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
advisory commission um I think it would
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to include language in
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
there that would prohibit people from
 
04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
having um Financial incentives from
 
04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
receiving some sort of a conflict of
 
04:52:15.070 --> 04:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
interest kind of language that maybe
 
04:52:18.548 --> 04:52:18.558 align:start position:0%
perhaps the board members have to be um
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't have investments in
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana they can't have certain things
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
there has to be some sort of disclosure
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
so we can trust that people are are
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
working in their best
 
04:52:31.270 --> 04:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
interest I'm going to write that section
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
up and I'll give it to darl and I'll
 
04:52:34.548 --> 04:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
include that there'll be no conflict of
 
04:52:37.390 --> 04:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
interest um either by Financial
 
04:52:39.830 --> 04:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
Financial um
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
matters to be a
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
member and anybody else if I could if
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
you and you may even want to consider
 
04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
immediate family members in that as
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
well household members just ethics
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
language that we use for standard ethics
 
04:52:59.070 --> 04:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
language anything else so remember if
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
you have a call out that's beyond the
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
bill that was an item you didn't agree
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
with and you want to call it out for the
 
04:53:06.390 --> 04:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
policy committee to adopt then you need
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
to send it to Daryl by Thursday because
 
04:53:10.110 --> 04:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
our reports due by Friday and the
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
report's going to be under Daryl
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
signature not the committee signature so
 
04:53:14.590 --> 04:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
he'll do it as chairman saying this is
 
04:53:16.830 --> 04:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
what was discussed and just so everyone
 
04:53:19.708 --> 04:53:19.718 align:start position:0%
knows I am actually leaving country on
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
wedes on Wednesday so Wednesday night
 
04:53:24.990 --> 04:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
but so if you expecting to reach me
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
Thursday morning it's not goingon to
 
04:53:27.350 --> 04:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
work so try to get to him as soon as you
 
04:53:28.670 --> 04:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
can if you have a call out for the
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
addendum we I think we have to as a
 
04:53:32.910 --> 04:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
commission still have to make a vote on
 
04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
a yay or name well no we don't have to
 
04:53:36.948 --> 04:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
so it can be the report can be under
 
04:53:38.948 --> 04:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
your signature as the activities of the
 
04:53:40.990 --> 04:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
commission and the bill is the m
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
majority of the I I think it's important
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
some people there's a minority a
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
majority and a Minority Report well
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
that's why they're going to send you
 
04:53:49.948 --> 04:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
aend dend language here's the bill we
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
drafted right that we had General
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
consensus the entire majority of the
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee and then the second piece will
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
be as a committee report not Bill the
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
addendums at or call outs like
 
04:54:02.390 --> 04:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
consumption and I think we still need to
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
take take the actual foral vote now you
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
know this bill again this is not even a
 
04:54:11.110 --> 04:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
bill this is just a hypothetical it's
 
04:54:12.868 --> 04:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
not a final product but I think we need
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
to actually vote as a I I have a problem
 
04:54:18.430 --> 04:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
voting on something I don't have in I've
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
always had in my committee my committee
 
04:54:23.868 --> 04:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
it's always been that when we vote we
 
04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
don't vote on what we think the
 
04:54:28.030 --> 04:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is going to look like I I have
 
04:54:30.750 --> 04:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
to I see the document before I would you
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
like me have this printed out for you
 
04:54:36.150 --> 04:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes please but just this language was
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
this understanding what this last
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
process I make sure I understand it
 
04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
correctly okay so but in terms of taking
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
a vote right at this moment I I feel
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're not well we're not meeting there's
 
04:54:51.910 --> 04:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
no other meeting I hear you you can I'm
 
04:54:53.430 --> 04:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
just telling I don't feel comfortable
 
04:54:55.270 --> 04:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
voting at this moment I you know because
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't even know what I'm
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
voting on so the recommendation's not
 
04:55:01.470 --> 04:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
even necessarily this bill where this is
 
04:55:04.110 --> 04:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
a proposal right but here will this
 
04:55:06.750 --> 04:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
franchise model work as discussed and
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a basis for it is every
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
provision we call that a straw vote I
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
guess so so again the the Daryl can Smit
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
it out we just do a you can do just an
 
04:55:19.708 --> 04:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
approval by email I think there was some
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
concern about doing an actual vote for
 
04:55:23.548 --> 04:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
putting like the AG on record for
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
federal law you know and that probably
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
not a good vote to take right and so I
 
04:55:28.708 --> 04:55:28.718 align:start position:0%
always vote again there were some people
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
there were some things that we again we
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
were going to look at this as a
 
04:55:33.590 --> 04:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
Chairman's report of the commission that
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
works for me too right and then it BS up
 
04:55:36.830 --> 04:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
Daryl signature we don't have to vote on
 
04:55:38.910 --> 04:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
it it's here's a list of everything that
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
we talked about here's the things we all
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
agreed on I got that I was fine with you
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's it was his insistent and and then
 
04:55:48.708 --> 04:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
and then secondarily to that is that
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who has like I still have
 
04:55:51.868 --> 04:55:51.878 align:start position:0%
concerns about public consumption I'm
 
04:55:54.548 --> 04:55:54.558 align:start position:0%
going to give it to Daryl as a a dentum
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
item saying that in this section the
 
04:55:58.030 --> 04:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee couldn't reach consensus and
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
this is my feeling as a majority you
 
04:56:02.670 --> 04:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
know of that I want enhanced secondary
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
penalties right and and allow for that
 
04:56:07.510 --> 04:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so I'll add that as a outside the
 
04:56:09.788 --> 04:56:09.798 align:start position:0%
bill conversation well I guess that to
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
to bring It full circle part of the
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
charge was to create legislation for
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
next year so the question is um we're
 
04:56:21.430 --> 04:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily voting on that uh
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
because we don't know who's going to
 
04:56:25.510 --> 04:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
bring that bill in so we'll have a we'll
 
04:56:28.670 --> 04:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
have a a bill without actual being a
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill but it's just a language of if a
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill was to go forward this is what we
 
04:56:33.310 --> 04:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
think the bill should look like yeah and
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
except for these Provisions where we
 
04:56:36.830 --> 04:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
like we couldn't come to a full
 
04:56:38.350 --> 04:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
consensus so there are people at the
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
enement provision for the ACLU right
 
04:56:42.788 --> 04:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
they may want to create a little call
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
out that says that we think that the
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
enement should be in and this is what we
 
04:56:47.190 --> 04:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
think it should look like okay but it's
 
04:56:49.230 --> 04:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
outside the bill because as a committee
 
04:56:51.310 --> 04:56:51.320 align:start position:0%
we voted not to include that language
 
04:56:52.510 --> 04:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
right and that gives the policy
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
committee some direction whoever gets it
 
04:56:56.910 --> 04:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
to say here's the bill starting point
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
and here's some things that are still
 
04:57:00.788 --> 04:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
left open to discuss okay and that'll be
 
04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's
 
04:57:02.200 --> 04:57:03.750 align:start position:0%
the Chairman's
report

04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:57:06.230 --> 04:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair when do you want our Minority
 
04:57:08.350 --> 04:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
Report to be given to you well in order
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
to have a Minority Report I we need to
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
have a vote you have to actually a vote
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
on this so I think what I what i' like
 
04:57:16.510 --> 04:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
to do is I probably can have this pass
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
around and print it out and everyone
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
wants to read it them me just you don't
 
04:57:22.628 --> 04:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
have our business and if you have call
 
04:57:24.390 --> 04:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
outs just send them the call outs again
 
04:57:25.948 --> 04:57:25.958 align:start position:0%
they'll do an addendum to the committee
 
04:57:27.430 --> 04:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
so but technically commission you don't
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
have to have that vote here you can you
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
draw up the document and it's like
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
whether we sign off off on it or not
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay and so you create the document you
 
04:57:39.788 --> 04:57:39.798 align:start position:0%
put everything in it you send it out and
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
maybe even uh you know Jared and ran
 
04:57:44.230 --> 04:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
they might they can still have an
 
04:57:46.510 --> 04:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sign it if they agree
 
04:57:48.910 --> 04:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
with what is the finished product so
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
that that that in terms of not having
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily a vote in this room having a
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
vote recorded vote it is that whether
 
04:57:58.150 --> 04:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
people want to sign off on can that be
 
04:57:59.628 --> 04:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
do you mind checking to see if that
 
04:58:01.708 --> 04:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
could be done by
 
04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
email you it's it's sort of like when we
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
when we do committee conference if you
 
04:58:08.190 --> 04:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
don't sign up it's dead right you can
 
04:58:09.868 --> 04:58:09.878 align:start position:0%
also report in you can also say go sign
 
04:58:12.910 --> 04:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
off for me to somebody exactly alandro
 
04:58:15.310 --> 04:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
you you have the most experience of all
 
04:58:21.190 --> 04:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:25.270 --> 04:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
here as I understand the committee Mak
 
04:58:32.110 --> 04:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:35.350 --> 04:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
happened the Corpus of the report is
 
04:58:38.070 --> 04:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
what took place here right at the
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
conclusion rep that's it that's your
 
04:58:43.948 --> 04:58:43.958 align:start position:0%
report to the committee that's it's
 
04:58:47.830 --> 04:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
under chairman signature so as this just
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
what we said this is what happened right
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay works for
 
04:58:54.830 --> 04:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
me all right
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
without I'm supposed to make a
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that the charge of the
 
04:59:00.708 --> 04:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
commission the bill the report will be
 
04:59:03.628 --> 04:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
the bill and and the addendum where's
 
04:59:04.990 --> 04:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
the charge pull up the legislation
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.628 --> 04:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
charge so establish a
 
04:59:24.430 --> 04:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
commission it's to establish a
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
commission to study the purpose of
 
04:59:27.868 --> 04:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation State controlled
 
04:59:31.030 --> 04:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
sales of
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis so the commission met we have a
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
document we went through 37 pages with
 
04:59:38.110 --> 04:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
various edits and cleanups um and that's
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
the core piece of or as Corpus as as
 
04:59:42.628 --> 04:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
Senate delandra said that's the Corpus
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill and then any Committee
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
Member can submit a note to it be
 
04:59:49.628 --> 04:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
attached to the report the bill for
 
04:59:52.190 --> 04:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
areas they disagree with or agree with
 
04:59:53.750 --> 04:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
well I'll just ask again when do you
 
04:59:55.470 --> 04:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
want us to have our Minority Report that
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
we've already prepared given to
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
you but is there going to be more than
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
one Minority Report now no no we work
 
05:00:03.510 --> 05:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
together as a team minority
 
05:00:05.470 --> 05:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
is it's just an addendum is addendum no
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
no no we we agreed that we talked about
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
and discussed as a committee you might
 
05:00:11.830 --> 05:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
have been on vacation again that you
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
Report so again the public consumption
 
05:00:27.310 --> 05:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
component anybody can put in ad dendam
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.920 --> 05:00:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
submitted

05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
people can send their Denman uh call us
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
but there's no voting by email right
 
05:00:49.230 --> 05:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
so it needs to that needs to be done and
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
if we if we don't we don't do what we're
 
05:00:52.830 --> 05:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to do we can't make a
 
05:00:54.548 --> 05:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation on proposed legislation
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
either way so I can have it printed out
 
05:00:59.548 --> 05:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:02.190 --> 05:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
at right so that's the charge of the
 
05:01:04.590 --> 05:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
commission we we have to do it so how
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
many people were actually voting it
 
05:01:12.470 --> 05:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.910 --> 05:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
three so the last vote was seven
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
people the seven people still here well
 
05:01:19.548 --> 05:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
no the last vote there were a lot of
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
people that didn't vote that I didn't
 
05:01:23.030 --> 05:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
force to vote like nope those three
 
05:01:25.350 --> 05:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
didn't vote at all no exactly so but
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
they're they're voting members the last
 
05:01:28.628 --> 05:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
vote we just had was four to three right
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
because only seven people chose to voice
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
all those seven people still in the room
 
05:01:32.320 --> 05:01:35.350 align:start position:0%
all those seven people still in the room
yeah

05:01:35.350 --> 05:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
so okay let's go vote again would you
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
like me to pass no it's fine let's just
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
vote we
 
05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
got be recognized to make a
 
05:01:48.190 --> 05:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
motion um I moved ought to pass uh on
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
this uh um this proposal but I think you
 
05:01:52.548 --> 05:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
want to move you do you recommend the
 
05:01:55.150 --> 05:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
proposal I recommend that this is the
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
language that is used for legislation
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
for next
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
session is there a
 
05:02:01.760 --> 05:02:03.868 align:start position:0%
session is there a
second

05:02:03.868 --> 05:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:02:07.868 --> 05:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
discussion after all that we're good
 
05:02:18.750 --> 05:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
again I think Mr chairman the question
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be are you going to allow an
 
05:02:22.510 --> 05:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
addendum for this report like I may vote
 
05:02:24.190 --> 05:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
for the bill I may vote for this to move
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
forward but I want an addendum on
 
05:02:27.150 --> 05:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
certain topics that I didn't have
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
agreement with the committee on 100% and
 
05:02:34.030 --> 05:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
listen to my to my friends on here that
 
05:02:35.708 --> 05:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
are elected
 
05:02:37.990 --> 05:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
members I'm not asking whether you
 
05:02:39.788 --> 05:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
support this in in a house vote or a
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
senate vote but this the provisions in
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
here part of a compromise that's that's
 
05:02:46.270 --> 05:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm kind of getting we're not
 
05:02:49.230 --> 05:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
recommending this ought to pass per se
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know on on the floor of leg body
 
05:02:53.910 --> 05:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
putting this forward is Provisions that
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
no none of us agree on every so so again
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
the vote is on the 37 Pages we just went
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
through in detail right and all the
 
05:03:02.430 --> 05:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
little minor changes we made in the last
 
05:03:04.990 --> 05:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
in in the last few hours and then there
 
05:03:06.548 --> 05:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
three other Provisions we've added that
 
05:03:08.910 --> 05:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
we we have and that's the the Cannabis
 
05:03:10.990 --> 05:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
advisory commission the limitation on
 
05:03:13.708 --> 05:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
state stores and the addition of the
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
Distributing distribution and
 
05:03:16.990 --> 05:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
warehousing language that we missed in
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
the bill um so that's what we're voting
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
on whether you agree with that concept
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
of that of that as the bill going
 
05:03:25.670 --> 05:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
forward and then every one of us will
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
have the chance to write Daryl um either
 
05:03:32.190 --> 05:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
a summary letter or individual articles
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
on what we we disagree with in the bill
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
so that the policy committee can take it
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
up everybody clear on that that's what
 
05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
the vote's about all
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
right all those in favor of the bill as
 
05:03:48.110 --> 05:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
we amended today um again not saying
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
that you support legalization but you
 
05:03:51.628 --> 05:03:51.638 align:start position:0%
support the bill as we presented it
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
hand all those
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
opposed one two three four five
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:05.430 align:start position:0%
opposed one two three four five
six

05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:07.628 --> 05:04:07.638 align:start position:0%
I want you to do as a Chairman's report
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
motion those it's been moved that it
 
05:04:15.548 --> 05:04:15.558 align:start position:0%
filed as a Chairman's report not as a
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
commission's report we'll just outline
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
exactly everything we've done here um
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
under Daryl signature rather than as a
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee vote so first of all um I I'm
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not recognizing the charge of the
 
05:04:28.510 --> 05:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
commission is to make a recommendation
 
05:04:30.990 --> 05:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
not a summarize a summary of what we did
 
05:04:34.270 --> 05:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
here in either way way the total vote of
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
this commission it's not binding on the
 
05:04:38.948 --> 05:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
legislative either way I understand
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
being on record one way or another I
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
know some of not everyone can vote some
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
people have an interest in this one way
 
05:04:47.230 --> 05:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
or another but the idea
 
05:04:49.390 --> 05:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
is you know we just we're going to put
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
out what what the committee recommended
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
what they didn't what they didn't
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
recommend that's it so you in all
 
05:04:57.750 --> 05:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
fairness you guys might have gotten the
 
05:04:59.110 --> 05:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
vote you were looking for if everyone
 
05:05:00.470 --> 05:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
showed up to do the job that they were
 
05:05:02.230 --> 05:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
CH that happens a lot that happens a lot
 
05:05:04.230 --> 05:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
the I hear but the vote didn't go your
 
05:05:06.910 --> 05:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
way and and it's what it is so right now
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
the recommendation the motion that's on
 
05:05:10.750 --> 05:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
the floor is to make this a Chairman's
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
report which would include the language
 
05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
that we adopted as the report saying
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
this is what we got consensus on um and
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
and approved with a majority vote of and
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
then I'm not I'm not recognizing someone
 
05:05:26.350 --> 05:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
for that motion because that that motion
 
05:05:29.190 --> 05:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with what the charge of
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
the commission is can I clarification if
 
05:05:36.150 --> 05:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
we are if we adopt the motion that was
 
05:05:38.070 --> 05:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
just made does that negate the vote that
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
was just had if we adopt yes if you had
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
if you adopted that motion it would just
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
be a Chairman's report not a
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the majority of the
 
05:05:48.708 --> 05:05:48.718 align:start position:0%
committee and the Chairman's reporting
 
05:05:51.150 --> 05:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
out this but he doesn't want but darl's
 
05:05:52.510 --> 05:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
taking his chairmanship back and saying
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
he's not recognizing the motion so it's
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
not the charge of the commission is very
 
05:05:58.030 --> 05:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
clear is to make a recommendation but
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
the but the recommendation was not to
 
05:06:01.708 --> 05:06:01.718 align:start position:0%
adopt so that's the vote that last taken
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what the
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
commissions right Y and they can be
 
05:06:09.230 --> 05:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
they'll be a Minority
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
Report yeah so be making a majority
 
05:06:15.590 --> 05:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
report ENT essentially but I don't I
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it's
 
05:06:17.280 --> 05:06:19.470 align:start position:0%
don't think it's
gonna

05:06:19.470 --> 05:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
so the vote just I just want to know
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
what I was voting for I abstained last
 
05:06:25.628 --> 05:06:25.638 align:start position:0%
time I just want to know what I'm voting
 
05:06:28.310 --> 05:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
for here is that we're voting that this
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
report was done but
 
05:06:31.400 --> 05:06:33.110 align:start position:0%
report was done but
we

05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
if there's things in there we disagree
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
with we're
 
05:06:41.230 --> 05:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
not so not every the draft that we put
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
together it's 37 Pages no one in this
 
05:06:45.310 --> 05:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
room agrees with everything in that
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
draft even if you support Canabis on any
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
level okay what we're trying to that I'm
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
just saying that the now that we've
 
05:06:56.190 --> 05:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
concluded basically our work we make a
 
05:06:58.670 --> 05:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
few tweaks that Senator Lang discussed
 
05:07:00.190 --> 05:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
the charge of the commission is to make
 
05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
a recommendation not just a summary of
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
what we talked what went on here so when
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
by making the recommendation that this
 
05:07:11.470 --> 05:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
is the legislation be proposed does not
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
mean that you support that legislation
 
05:07:16.390 --> 05:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
it just means that's what we're
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
essentially if legislation is to be
 
05:07:20.670 --> 05:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
filed that's consistent with that
 
05:07:23.990 --> 05:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
language and obviously not not that you
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
agree with all of it but the the concept
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
of it okay and you can make your own
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
objections addendums to say well I I
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
although I supported recommendation of
 
05:07:34.990 --> 05:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I didn't support these
 
05:07:36.910 --> 05:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
sections right and some of those are
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
policy sections that are outside the
 
05:07:40.830 --> 05:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
charge of the Commission in the first
 
05:07:42.910 --> 05:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
place otherwise we could anything on
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
possession limits anything on driving uh
 
05:07:48.270 --> 05:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
some of the the health aspects all that
 
05:07:50.548 --> 05:07:50.558 align:start position:0%
stuff is really outside the scope of
 
05:07:52.430 --> 05:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
this just putting together the franchise
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
model is really a smaller section of the
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill so some of those those those policy
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
and social issues that we've been
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
discussing the annulments all that part
 
05:08:04.270 --> 05:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
is really outside of what we need to be
 
05:08:06.670 --> 05:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
doing here so I think it's important to
 
05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
do it all at once and we have those
 
05:08:10.708 --> 05:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
conversations but all we're doing is
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
saying this is what we came up with this
 
05:08:14.548 --> 05:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
is what we're putting forward if we
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
agree with that or not if that's not
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
what we agree with if someone has
 
05:08:19.788 --> 05:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
another version they want to present so
 
05:08:22.350 --> 05:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
be it or they can be a Minority Report
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
but we're not saying that anyone
 
05:08:27.430 --> 05:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
supports this policy on by any means
 
05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
simply because they support passively
 
05:08:31.548 --> 05:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
problem is Mr chair we've taken a vote
 
05:08:33.868 --> 05:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
and um based on the the thing and the
 
05:08:37.070 --> 05:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
vote was not to make a recommendation on
 
05:08:39.788 --> 05:08:39.798 align:start position:0%
on not to support the bill and the
 
05:08:41.310 --> 05:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the bill so at this
 
05:08:43.830 --> 05:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
point the Minority Report which would be
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
the people who want to support this bill
 
05:08:47.510 --> 05:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
would write a thing but the majority
 
05:08:49.470 --> 05:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
report would be after meeting the
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
committee recommends no bill go forward
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
because that's what the recommendation
 
05:08:54.110 --> 05:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
was I still think that motion needs to
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
be made yeah I'm about to make I'm about
 
05:08:56.910 --> 05:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
to make that motion I I'd like to make a
 
05:08:59.990 --> 05:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chair and unless anyone wants
 
05:09:01.708 --> 05:09:01.718 align:start position:0%
a reconsideration because they were
 
05:09:01.718 --> 05:09:02.868 align:start position:0%
a reconsideration because they were
confused

05:09:02.868 --> 05:09:02.878 align:start position:0%
confused
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I recommend we adjourn and come back
 
05:09:07.750 --> 05:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.310 --> 05:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
days we can't one December is the date
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not going to work two
 
05:09:17.470 --> 05:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
days so you want to come on the 29th
 
05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
come yeah maybe get some people to show
 
05:09:23.548 --> 05:09:23.558 align:start position:0%
up point of order I was gonna make a
 
05:09:23.558 --> 05:09:25.390 align:start position:0%
up point of order I was gonna make a
motion

05:09:25.390 --> 05:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:09:30.190 --> 05:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
get all right well listen no so you
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
weren I'm asking I don't even think we
 
05:09:35.868 --> 05:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
canet meet the notice requirement two
 
05:09:38.590 --> 05:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
days it be three
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
of so unless someone wants to make make
 
05:09:42.000 --> 05:09:44.270 align:start position:0%
of so unless someone wants to make make
a

05:09:44.270 --> 05:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
reconsideration so representative K Hill
 
05:09:51.788 --> 05:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
you recognized no um is if someone was
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
on the prevailing side would have to
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
make a motion for reconsideration
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
stained the only it's only the five that
 
05:09:59.910 --> 05:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be S Ganon the four over here and
 
05:10:01.310 --> 05:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
one other person I can't who on the
 
05:10:04.548 --> 05:10:04.558 align:start position:0%
commission anyone make actually
 
05:10:06.390 --> 05:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
reconsideration arguments always been
 
05:10:08.030 --> 05:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be on the prevailing side
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
before we add does anyone wish to would
 
05:10:13.150 --> 05:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.160 --> 05:10:16.190 align:start position:0%
 
reconsideration

05:10:16.190 --> 05:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.548 --> 05:10:18.558 align:start position:0%
anyone I do a I do a motion to
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
reconsider based on your explanation
 
05:10:24.030 --> 05:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
about what this report means he was
 
05:10:26.750 --> 05:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
again I re I'm pretty sure you abstain
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
from the vote no that doesn't apply in
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions from what I
 
05:10:31.040 --> 05:10:32.750 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions from what I
understand

05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:10:40.548 --> 05:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.350 --> 05:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
law so if I could just to be
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
clear this doesn't mean that somebody
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
can't pick up this language and run with
 
05:10:53.190 --> 05:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
it in the house or Senate this doesn't
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
change anything exactly I know that
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's why even negative recommendation
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say corre oh no like this is
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
corre trust me someone's in a end the
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
world at the any time a Chairman's
 
05:11:04.548 --> 05:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
report is not with the charge of the
 
05:11:07.150 --> 05:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners right so I I don't see how
 
05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
doing that is right this doesn't prevent
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
any any language going forward so all
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
I'm asking
 
05:11:19.548 --> 05:11:19.558 align:start position:0%
is so the point of order is whether
 
05:11:21.030 --> 05:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
someone can make a reconsideration if
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
they didn't vote in the first
 
05:11:23.160 --> 05:11:26.430 align:start position:0%
they didn't vote in the first
place

05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.310 --> 05:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
believe motion before we we made that
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
point of
 
05:11:30.958 --> 05:11:33.430 align:start position:0%
point of
order

05:11:33.430 --> 05:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
order
 
05:11:35.708 --> 05:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
was that motion seconded before we
 
05:11:39.070 --> 05:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
didn't I wasn't allowed to make my
 
05:11:43.070 --> 05:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
motion yeah all right well so let me ask
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
you this is there is there a motion for
 
05:11:46.110 --> 05:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
reconsideration that it's willing to be
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
made and will it even matter trust me if
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
the other everyone else still um decides
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
not to vote or whatever it's it's not
 
05:11:54.070 --> 05:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to change the
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
outcome so we can do a reconsideration
 
05:11:59.390 --> 05:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
that is helpful Mr chair the only thing
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
I will say we do have time if we want to
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
meet on Wednesday so we can have a
 
05:12:04.548 --> 05:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
finalized copy of the bill in our hands
 
05:12:06.788 --> 05:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
to vote um so everybody understands the
 
05:12:08.110 --> 05:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
components because I know there was some
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
that were concerned about that um
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think right now um we've
 
05:12:16.590 --> 05:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
we've rejected the bill at this point
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
does that satisfy the notice reir yes so
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
commission need only 24 24 hours so we
 
05:12:24.470 --> 05:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
can meet on the
 
05:12:26.868 --> 05:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
29th and we could have a finalized
 
05:12:28.990 --> 05:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and have discussion
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
but understand that as it stands now the
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
last motion to pass on this committee
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
was to reject the bill and the majority
 
05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
report would be to reject the bill and
 
05:12:39.070 --> 05:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
the Minority Report would be to accept
 
05:12:41.708 --> 05:12:41.718 align:start position:0%
the bill we could still do it if we Boo
 
05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
or we can hold this off and see if after
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
language comes out everybody we can
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
consider do a reconsideration vote um
 
05:12:50.910 --> 05:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
for the members as long as we're allowed
 
05:12:54.430 --> 05:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
to meet in that time here I guess I mean
 
05:12:55.708 --> 05:12:55.718 align:start position:0%
you can just ignore what I'm going to
 
05:12:58.750 --> 05:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
say but I would I object to that I
 
05:13:01.150 --> 05:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
object to the fact that this is cheesy
 
05:13:01.160 --> 05:13:02.868 align:start position:0%
object to the fact that this is cheesy
maneuvering

05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
maneuvering
 
05:13:06.628 --> 05:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
had the vote and and this will carry
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
this will not prevent anyone from going
 
05:13:11.708 --> 05:13:11.718 align:start position:0%
forward and making legislation and
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
picking up this paper and copying it
 
05:13:16.830 --> 05:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
word for word and including any one of
 
05:13:19.390 --> 05:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
you on there as a bill sponsor or
 
05:13:21.868 --> 05:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and that's I agree with you
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
100% that's why I think the I think the
 
05:13:26.590 --> 05:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
commission the recommendation although
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
it's it may hold some way It ultimately
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
can still be anything can be I agree so
 
05:13:33.990 --> 05:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
let me again I'm just going to ask one
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
really crazy question it's going to get
 
05:13:37.548 --> 05:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
me people mad at me but Chief were you
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
the appointed member by the by the New
 
05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chief Association or was it
 
05:13:42.470 --> 05:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else I'm the substitute because
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
he's out of state he's out of country
 
05:13:46.868 --> 05:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
right so we already counted his vot
 
05:13:48.708 --> 05:13:48.718 align:start position:0%
there's a point whether it's a legal
 
05:13:49.990 --> 05:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
vote because he's not the appointed
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
author it wouldn't it wouldn't have
 
05:13:53.470 --> 05:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
mattered because then would have been 44
 
05:13:54.750 --> 05:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
he would have needed to raise that point
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:03.670 --> 05:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
now you guys I have a lot of respect for
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
all are you really going to tell me
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
let's start with uh let's start with Tim
 
05:14:10.628 --> 05:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come over
 
05:14:13.628 --> 05:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
toor let Senator alandro speak Tim he
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
hasn't spoken as long as you're not
 
05:14:15.788 --> 05:14:15.798 align:start position:0%
gonna make a
 
05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
motion Senor aland he hasn't spoken on
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
this I I respect sen Senator delandro he
 
05:14:23.230 --> 05:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
follows the the rules and order thank
 
05:14:27.030 --> 05:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
you very much for defer I I I I suggest
 
05:14:29.150 --> 05:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
that the report from this committee be
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
without recommendation the document be
 
05:14:35.868 --> 05:14:35.878 align:start position:0%
presented but there is there isn't a
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation we we we did what we we
 
05:14:40.948 --> 05:14:40.958 align:start position:0%
did what we were supposed to do we heard
 
05:14:43.470 --> 05:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
everything we came up with a document
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
the document is presented but without
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation so is that as
 
05:14:53.590 --> 05:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
chairman is that something that can be
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
is that a motion that can be made well
 
05:14:57.470 --> 05:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
first so L was on The Winning Side so if
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
he makes a motion to reconsider we can
 
05:15:00.910 --> 05:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
vote to reconsider and then we can make
 
05:15:03.230 --> 05:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
a different motion to do it without
 
05:15:04.990 --> 05:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation that would allow it to go
 
05:15:06.430 --> 05:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
forward with the language of the bill
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
that is in with all due respect Senator
 
05:15:12.150 --> 05:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
delandro yes I was recognized I asked to
 
05:15:15.470 --> 05:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
okay you you know so he was going to go
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
second so go ahead we have an obligation
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
to follow the rules even if we don't
 
05:15:25.788 --> 05:15:25.798 align:start position:0%
like the rules or don't like the outcome
 
05:15:27.750 --> 05:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
we've all lost on days we didn't want to
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
lose I made a mo I I asked to be
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
recognized we can go back and play the
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
tape in order to make a motion I'm going
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
to make a motion make a motion I'd like
 
05:15:41.070 --> 05:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
to make a motion that we recommend as a
 
05:15:44.910 --> 05:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee that no legislation go
 
05:15:49.750 --> 05:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
second made second it's been moved and
 
05:15:53.868 --> 05:15:53.878 align:start position:0%
seconded the recommendation of the
 
05:15:55.230 --> 05:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
committee report would be to not go
 
05:15:56.868 --> 05:15:56.878 align:start position:0%
forward with any legislation although I
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
think actually you said that literally I
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
don't know that you can actually I'm not
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
sure it's a valid you can't prohibit a
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
representative or senat to bring
 
05:16:05.628 --> 05:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
legalization language for you can
 
05:16:07.708 --> 05:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
recommend that they not do it but it's
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
not binding on anybody any
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
legis so which so there's a motion and
 
05:16:14.430 --> 05:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
there's a second to I think was the
 
05:16:16.270 --> 05:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
point that senat alandre was trying to
 
05:16:18.750 --> 05:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
make that i' making no recommendation
 
05:16:22.750 --> 05:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
May somewhat satisfy some of
 
05:16:25.788 --> 05:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
the make sure you qualif what is your
 
05:16:27.670 --> 05:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
motion rephrase the motion re restate
 
05:16:29.230 --> 05:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
just motion stop anybody from putting in
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
so what is your motion on just if I
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman just a point for
 
05:16:36.548 --> 05:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
discussion what what I'm recommending is
 
05:16:38.548 --> 05:16:38.558 align:start position:0%
we have done the work that was that was
 
05:16:41.910 --> 05:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
presented to us we have come up with no
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's what the report
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's the report should indicate we did
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
take a vote and there was a clear
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
majority saying we don't want to put
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
this forward so they don't there's no
 
05:16:57.150 --> 05:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation this is not
 
05:17:00.590 --> 05:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
recommend I I'm making a motion that we
 
05:17:04.750 --> 05:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:07.110 --> 05:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
this committee report is that you just
 
05:17:08.470 --> 05:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
want to say you you want to make a
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
motion that the recommendation is that
 
05:17:15.948 --> 05:17:15.958 align:start position:0%
no report is moved forward correct
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay that's the recommendation motion
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
second okay and now second motion is
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
forward no he can't say no legislation
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
he can only say no report because he he
 
05:17:36.030 --> 05:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
can't bind anybody for put a
 
05:17:39.390 --> 05:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
bill well it's not binding either
 
05:17:41.788 --> 05:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
way I get it you guys don't like the
 
05:17:43.390 --> 05:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
fact no it's a recommendation like
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we took a vote the vote
 
05:17:47.470 --> 05:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
didn't go the way a lot of you guys
 
05:17:50.230 --> 05:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
would like representative respectfully
 
05:17:52.590 --> 05:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
all we're saying is the recommendation
 
05:17:55.390 --> 05:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
was the first motion was to propose
 
05:17:57.150 --> 05:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
legislation it didn't go forward now the
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to not put forward
 
05:18:01.628 --> 05:18:01.638 align:start position:0%
legislation it's but you we're saying
 
05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
you it's your recommendation that's
 
05:18:05.150 --> 05:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're just rephrasing what you're saying
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay we're not taking away from the
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
point you're trying to make
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay that so to clarify is that is is
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
your um is your Rec is your uh point of
 
05:18:17.040 --> 05:18:28.628 align:start position:0%
your um is your Rec is your uh point of
order

05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
rescinded yes it just I think the idea
 
05:18:34.070 --> 05:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
is there's going to be a majority report
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to recommend no legislation
 
05:18:38.548 --> 05:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
on this issue be filed and there'll be a
 
05:18:40.350 --> 05:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
minority that that's what that's what it
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
can be done that's where we are right
 
05:18:44.510 --> 05:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
now know I think there are people that
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
are good with that I think the reason
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the weed is because
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
there's people who are not good with
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
that I think it was just a matter of how
 
05:18:57.948 --> 05:18:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:00.430 --> 05:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair but in Ence we're
 
05:19:02.310 --> 05:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
