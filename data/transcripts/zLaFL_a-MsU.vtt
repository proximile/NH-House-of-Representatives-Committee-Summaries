00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
are we going i'm assuming this is being
 
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
are we going i'm assuming this is being
videoed

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
let me know when we get going
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
this all feels very different it feels
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
attendance roster
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
um the first uh we are doing interim
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
study bills and before we uh begin that
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
i want to just go through
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
what happens with interim study bills
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
for many uh for anybody who was here in
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
their first or second session this is
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
really the first time dealing with an
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
interim study bill because last session
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
of course ended early and there was no
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
interim study of any bills
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
so if you want to sort of find out what
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
happened you actually have to go back
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
to the prior session
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
that is two sessions ago so
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
the deadline for work on interim study
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
bills is actually after the summer in
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
if this feels like you're being dragged
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
back to school after graduation can you
 
00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
imagine coming back here in september or
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
october to deal with these so we we're
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get this done in june
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
but the report deadline is technically
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the fall if you look at your calendar
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that date is in the
 
00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that date is in the
fall

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the calendar one of the last last
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
calendars of this session will come out
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
and i expect it will be at the beginning
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
of november and it will have the reports
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
from the interim study bills
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
but as you know as a body we will only
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
meet again for veto day
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
probably sometime in september
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
so these actually will not be voted on
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
um these simply go as a recommendation
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
to either file something in the future
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
or not we cannot vote on things
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
in regards to binding other sessions and
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
other sessions are not required to do
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
anything that we do if you want to look
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
at interim study reports you would go to
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
the 9
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
november 2018
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
house calendar
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that will be all of the the interim
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
study reports that were filed for the
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
bills of that session
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
and you will see that it is either the
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
bills are either recommended or not
 
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.150 align:start position:0%
bills are either recommended or not
recommended

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.269 align:start position:0%
recommended
and

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
there is no possibility to amend a bill
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
we are literally considering the bill
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
as it is that is the those are the only
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
two motions that can be made
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
so some people
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
so there is a reason why interim study
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
is sort of referred to as the end of a
 
00:16:25.519 --> 00:16:26.790 align:start position:0%
is sort of referred to as the end of a
bill

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
because it is really difficult for the
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
committee if not impossible to do
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
anything substantively and obviously
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
legislators are
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
free to file legislation next session
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the recommendation of
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
any committee is on interim study bills
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
and you're not the only people have been
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
dragged back for this as you know we
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
were kicked out of our regular room
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
because someone else had already been
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
assigned it
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
all right so with that i asked uh
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
christina to go through some research so
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
we could figure out what if anything
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
else had happened so the first bill we
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
have today and i note that one of the
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors of 327 is with us today
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
is in regards to requiring that voter
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
show id when personally delivering
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
this was introduced when we had it by uh
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
catherine prudhomme o'brien
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative who was prime sponsor of
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
we heard from
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
i think then deputy scanlan now he might
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
have been secretary at that point
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to the bill itself and there
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
were a number of questions in regards to
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
how to proceed
 
00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:37.590 align:start position:0%
how to proceed
so

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
christina has done a memo
 
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to open it up to
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
discussion now because i don't want to
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
leave this whole thing here
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
um and
if

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
no i have a copy of an amendment
 
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.190 align:start position:0%
no i have a copy of an amendment
but

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
nobody else seemed to have that copy did
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
we just not
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
decide on the amendment
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
by rep
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
filed by representative marsh and
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative quailey
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative quailey's here yeah
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
do you recall your amendment i i don't
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
have it in my book on 327 when i pulled
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
well i brought some material relevant to
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
that bill might be in here uh i have a
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
question though
 
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.789 align:start position:0%
question though
we're

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
recommending and not recommending the
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
because the amendment i think was
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
adopted by the committee but not by the
 
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:36.870 align:start position:0%
adopted by the committee but not by the
house

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
but was what was the amendment adopted
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
by the committee i don't remember i
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't know i'm going to have to i don't
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
have that it was adopted by the
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee okay that i might be
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
misremembering that and i'm i'm seeing
 
00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:47.909 align:start position:0%
misremembering that and i'm i'm seeing
that

00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
my legislative support here is but but
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
in any case since the bill was not
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
amended by the house then are we
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
recommending or not recommending the
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced we are okay thank you
 
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.470 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced we are okay thank you
um

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
so for so let me read a report from a
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill from a previous session it is not
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
an election law bill
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
um it was an environmental and
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
agricultural bill and it was not
 
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
the full committee met with interested
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
parties regarding the issue this was
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
crop theft members of this committee
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
will be introducing new legislation in
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
the new biennium based on our findings
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the bill was retained and
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
subsequently referred
 
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.310 align:start position:0%
subsequently referred
because

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
the committee felt that things needed to
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
um ultimately the participants decided
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
that no more comprehensive bills should
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
be brought forward if those things
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
should not be addressed
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that this bill in its particular
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
form should not go forward
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
this one is a multiple employer public
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
retirement plan
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
the committee felt that the
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
that employers would benefit from
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
multiple plans this legislation as
 
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.830 align:start position:0%
multiple plans this legislation as
written

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
will not work
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
things are changing at the federal level
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the committee strongly believes the
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
study committee should be formed to look
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
at those changes in regulation and how
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
other legislation has been working
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
before we fully implement this um
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that was a not recommend
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
actually i printed out a sheet where it
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
looks like everything is not recommended
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether that's a sign for
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
oh no here here is um
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
one that's recommended the committee
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
recommends that legislation be
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
introduced to allow
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system to review positions
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
and not require an additional
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
legislative approval
 
00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
legislative approval
so

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
it recommended
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the concept but felt that there were
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
still problems so this is really what
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative clearly what had your
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
it attempted to refine the
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
signature matching requirement in part
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
added that
 
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:43.029 align:start position:0%
added that
provision

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
attempted to fine-tune the signature
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
matching requirement i would say is a
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
good summary of what the amendment tried
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
the issue with signature matching right
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
now as i think we mostly understand is
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
made invalid by a court decision
 
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
made invalid by a court decision
uh

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
i think that was
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
i forget the date of the court have it
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
here but anyways made it it was
 
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.029 align:start position:0%
here but anyways made it it was
uh

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess in regular english you
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
could say it was put on hold because of
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
some procedural problems
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the court saw with
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
how it's conducted
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
the court decision is i understood the
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
decision and i did review it
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
as a layman not a lawyer but
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
it appeared to me that the court
 
00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.390 align:start position:0%
it appeared to me that the court
decision

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
decision
uh

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
ruled out signature matching based on
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
procedural difficulties for example lack
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
of training of moderators
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh to actually analyze handwriting
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
it didn't rule it out as a matter of
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
principle and in fact signature matching
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
is used in absentee ballots
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
when i read this last in 31 different
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
states including states like california
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
and nevada and so on
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the amendment by representative marsh
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
and i intended to
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune the procedure in the hopes
 
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.350 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune the procedure in the hopes
of

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
overcoming some of the
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
my recollection is accurate this is from
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
over a year ago but i believe we decided
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
it should go to interims we believed
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately as a committee should go to
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
because we really need to take a an
 
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
overall look at the signature matching
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
not just try to fix a piece of it here
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
and there
 
00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
and there
so

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
the signature reviewed by the clerk and
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
make a marking that it had been no
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me the bill is originally
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
produced would have the
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
absentee voter prevent id present id to
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then the clerk would make a notation
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
say the
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot when received didn't
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
need to be signature matched
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
well that's kind of beside the point
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
right now because we don't have a
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
bergeron i have some notes here about
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
your comments on some
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
needed work on the bill
 
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:18.710 align:start position:0%
needed work on the bill
yeah

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things i recall on
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative quayley's amendment too
 
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.830 align:start position:0%
representative quayley's amendment too
was

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
a recommendation that we simplify the
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
marking of the envelope
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
and it would just say vv for voter
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
verified instead of a i p i d s appeared
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
in person id shown
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh which makes a lot of sense i'm all
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
for streamlining and making things more
 
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
for streamlining and making things more
efficient

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
one of the major objections though i had
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
at the time was that
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
the clerk is being directed to mark the
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot affidavit
 
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
and under existing law the clerk is not
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
authorized to remove the affidavit
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
envelope from the outer envelope so
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
we're setting up a conflicting situation
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
here where one statute says the clerk
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
shall not remove the affidavit envelope
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
and another one is saying yeah go ahead
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
and take it away so that you can you can
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
mark up the affidavit envelope so that
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
issue needed to be resolved
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
and although i didn't bring it up at the
 
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
and although i didn't bring it up at the
time

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
this uh and i can't find in state law so
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
it might be in the election procedures
 
00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:21.190 align:start position:0%
it might be in the election procedures
manual

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
manual
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
currently when uh designated agents are
 
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.029 align:start position:0%
currently when uh designated agents are
delivering

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
delivering
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots let's say for example
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
from a nursing home
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
they have to show id and fill out a form
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
and present a letter that authorizes
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
them to do so
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
voter verification at the time envelopes
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
are being dropped off it would be nice
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
to have a process in place that applies
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
across the board to everybody
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
so that maybe we can get rid of these
 
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.110 align:start position:0%
so that maybe we can get rid of these
forms

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
that are being filled out by family
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
members and by nursing home
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
representatives and just have a similar
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
voter verified process going through so
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
voter verification process being used
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
instances of ballot delivery not have
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
one for one group another process for a
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
second group and so on
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the issues that
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know we we had discussed
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
represented with the committee's
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
permission there is a representative
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
here who was one of the sponsors of the
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
bill did you want to add anything to the
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on the come up and add
 
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.710 align:start position:0%
discussion on the come up and add
anything

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
all right the research that uh
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
attorney dyer got us indicated that
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
there was another bill going around with
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
this and i believe that was also part of
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
our discussion on it
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
um and it died in committee of
 
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
um and it died in committee of
conference

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
so there were a couple of bills to deal
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
with this verification
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on 327
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
if there's not i'm going to move on
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
to the next bill like i said we'll go
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
through a discussion on all of these
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
take a short break and then we'll come
 
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.190 align:start position:0%
take a short break and then we'll come
back

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
480 is relative to verification of
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
we had a public hearing on this
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
you have in the research from
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.789 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
there was a similar bill and the
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
information on this is contained in the
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
so i'll give people a minute to look at
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
i will say i was a little surprised when
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
i looked at the research memo how long
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
just for members of the public who might
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
be watching we got a research memo one
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
day that was on public acc public access
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
to ballots
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
um where legislation also crossed over
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
into verification of ballots
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that this issue has
 
00:28:58.159 --> 00:28:59.110 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that this issue has
been

00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh going on for
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years in regards to bills
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
and as to access it's been going on even
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
longer access to ballots cast an
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
election i think was back in
 
00:29:32.000 --> 00:30:37.669 align:start position:0%
election i think was back in
2007

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard on this went on
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
for some time as i recall
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony in the first instance was
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
introduction by jess edwards the
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative from auburn who was prime
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
he acknowledged that this bill
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
had been submitted a number of times
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
before and while christina did not look
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
into the details of it i suspect it was
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
very similar to that first passed or
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
submitted in 2007
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
there was testimony in favor of it
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office was in
 
00:31:14.159 --> 00:31:15.909 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office was in
opposition

00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:31:15.919 --> 00:31:16.830 align:start position:0%
opposition
to

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
ballots having never been seen
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that there had been previously been
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
a court case in regards to this issue
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that the recount deals with the
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
issue of counting
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
and that there's concern over privacy of
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
the voter by
 
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.830 align:start position:0%
the voter by
allowing

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:49.909 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you thank
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.149 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
um

00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
there were a few issues that local
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
officials raised about this um
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
first of all the 28 a consideration
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
on page two for example it says the
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
towns and cities may request
 
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.350 align:start position:0%
towns and cities may request
reimbursement

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
of additional expenses from the
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh from the election fund established
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
under rsa 5 colon 6d
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that the secretary of
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
state shall reimburse the cities and
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
towns for any expenses they occur and
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
they can be formidable
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
i know in nashua for example if we were
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
to have a city-wide recount it's going
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
to take all day
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that assumes enough people have been
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
recruited to work
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh on the on the recount so i assume
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
that it will require
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
residents citizens whomever
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
do this looking or or counting of
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
ballots uh a day or or perhaps longer
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
there are no restrictions in the bill
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
that say how much time they need to get
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
this done for example if they only have
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
four people that show up to start
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
reviewing the ballots and they want to
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
review the city's entire ballots cast
 
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:03.509 align:start position:0%
review the city's entire ballots cast
boxes

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
boxes
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
it could take days
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
and city and town clerks have very
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
limited staff they don't necessarily get
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
a build up
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
at election time some some cities and
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
towns do build up staff so they have
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
their regular operations to take care of
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
this would require staff be pulled to to
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
remove the boxes from storage and then
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
be present when all these materials are
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
being counted
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that's going to increase staff
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
obligations and costs on the cities and
 
00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
obligations and costs on the cities and
towns

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
there's also no limitation on who can
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
ask for the recounts it can be any
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
registered new hampshire voters so
 
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.549 align:start position:0%
registered new hampshire voters so
presumably

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
a resident of nashua could go to
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
manchester and say we want to look at
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
all your ballots
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
that so that's a concern
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's no restrictions on how often
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
this can be done
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
presumably you might have 10 or 12
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
individuals that want to do this 10 or
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
12 different times because they each
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
have their own agenda they might be
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
looking for different
 
00:33:56.799 --> 00:33:57.590 align:start position:0%
looking for different
uh

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
issues when they're reviewing the ballot
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
so it's just too open-ended it's too
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
expensive and
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more controls in place
 
00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more controls in place
for

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think the ballot review issue is
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
something that's happened
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
obviously we see from the memo
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
over time we heard a lot about it in
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
this committee in public hearings
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of competing
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
interests to balance that so far
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:32.790 align:start position:0%
interests to balance that so far
just

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
opening up ballots for inspection would
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
seem to be problematic we'll see where
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
the audit goes and that's our next bill
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to hb 524
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
this was the
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
first year session
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh bill that we heard in regards to
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
audit it directed the secretary of
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
state's office to conduct hand recounts
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
at five randomly select selected
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
locations that use electronic counting
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
devices within 21 days after the general
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
election is held
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
this prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative lang is with us today
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
um and i will ask him to if he wants to
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
speak on this after we have a little
 
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.589 align:start position:0%
speak on this after we have a little
discussion

00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
um it should be noted that hb 14 67
 
00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.069 align:start position:0%
um it should be noted that hb 14 67
passed

00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
in regards to a partial audit
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
which will occur
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you members
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.430 align:start position:0%
of the committee
so

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
this bill was about
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in government
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
and so i asked that
 
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:03.430 align:start position:0%
and so i asked that
you

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation i
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
understand there is some mechanical
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
issues in the bill that we need to
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
address and i will address if i refiled
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and come back next year
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
but i think again the concept of the
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
bill is is sound
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
that like just like any public uh
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
company auditing of financials are
 
00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.270 align:start position:0%
company auditing of financials are
important

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
to prove um
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know have positive outlook on a
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
company when you're looking to invest or
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
looking to do something so again i think
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
that an audit or a verification count
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
like this is is needed i think the bill
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
on his face is a good concept um does
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
have mechanical issues which i'm happy
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
to work out next year should i return to
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
this fine body so thank you
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative muirhead
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.710 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative do you think that the
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
that hp 1467 which is passed by both
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
chambers addresses some of the concerns
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
again i i i'm not
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
positive about that if you want to give
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
me a summary of what that bill was and i
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
can tell you whether i i agree with you
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:20.829 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh
1467

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
1467
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
um was the product of a committee of
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
conference so that tells you something
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh and what it addresses is an audit in
 
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.190 align:start position:0%
uh and what it addresses is an audit in
the

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
primary and general election of 2022
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
only with a report to be published
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's a gross overview
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
anybody and representative bergeron
 
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.030 align:start position:0%
anybody and representative bergeron
agrees

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
agrees
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
so again i i think that helps um i i
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
think an ongoing
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
at the state general election i'm not so
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
worried about the primaries but the
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
state general elections um an ongoing
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
um audit that's in statute will
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
slowly increase voter confidence in that
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
fact that the they think that their
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
ballot counted um just having a one-time
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
hit it's one of the reasons why again in
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
this bill i was interested i found out
 
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.230 align:start position:0%
this bill i was interested i found out
that

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
the last time we've done a recount of a
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
statewide election was in the 70s i
 
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.150 align:start position:0%
statewide election was in the 70s i
believe

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's been 50 years since a statewide
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
race has been was that the senate race i
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't recall which race i remember was
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
in the 70s it was the senate yeah and so
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald how many votes
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh well it shifted back and forth
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
initially it was like
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
so so again the idea being that
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
voter confidence is going to change
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
overnight that's going to take a long
 
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
overnight that's going to take a long
term

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
process to to re to instill greater
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in in the election
 
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.510 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in in the election
process

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
especially given the
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
what's happened over the last few years
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
the elections so
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
again i think a one-time audit's great
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
but i think an audit of uh two percent
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
of every ballot and every race on every
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
on those that two percent is important
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
to instill voter confidence
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.910 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
lang

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
lang
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
the both of these bills including that
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
are truly
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
recount bills not audit bills i know
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
column audits but an audit would be a
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
much broader
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
the processes and the procedures
 
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.829 align:start position:0%
the processes and the procedures
okay

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
the application of
 
00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.390 align:start position:0%
the application of
rules

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
some training assessment
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
it goes well beyond just the recount
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
and neither of those bills
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
fill that
 
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.950 align:start position:0%
fill that
void

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
void
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
i i would agree with you again i called
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
it a verification count because it does
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
two things right besides verifying what
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
the actual ballot counts were it
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
verifies that towns are doing it right
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a moderator um and and i welcome and
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
his secretary of state wants to come in
 
00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.030 align:start position:0%
his secretary of state wants to come in
and

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
do a verification to make sure my
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
numbers are right and everything's
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
working you know the numbers i reported
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
were the actual numbers of the ballots
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
um i i think that's important because it
 
00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:14.950 align:start position:0%
um i i think that's important because it
again

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
the random idea of this bill was the
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
fact that every town could potentially
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
be subjected to a verification count to
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that the processes they were
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
following are right that the ballot the
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
numbers they put on the moderators
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
report they call it that you put on and
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
you give to the secretary of state that
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that matches
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
what was actual every piece of paper
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
that you have you're supposed to account
 
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:34.710 align:start position:0%
that you have you're supposed to account
for

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
so it does besides giving a voter
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
confidence it also will make sure that
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
the process is being followed properly
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
right because you're verifying what's
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
reported by the town is what's
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
anything else from committee members for
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
 
00:40:57.599 --> 00:40:59.030 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
mooney

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
mooney
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative for coming i also want to
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to senate bill 366.
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh which came to finance which i sit on
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh having been on this committee for a
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
year and now finance comes in handy in a
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
conversation like this but senate bill
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
366 were the random audits in the fall
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
so how does that and we've been talking
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
a lot about house bill 1467
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
so just want to bring that to your
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
attention and see if you have any
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
comments with regards to that because it
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
looks like it's getting ready for a
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial signature senate bill 366.
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
again i i'm not familiar with that bill
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i'd have to go back and read it um
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know so again i'll look at that
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
again that may add that may adjust again
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
if if the committee makes the
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation of of um
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation i'll
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
look at that bill as well and see if and
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
fill any gaps right because we all know
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
that first passes a bill sometimes are
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
not perfect so maybe between
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
recommending this and looking at that
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
bill we can find a more perfect
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
solution and thank you to representative
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%

00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else for representative lang
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%

madam chair

kiss you
 
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.109 align:start position:0%
kiss you
um

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i agree with uh the sponsor of the
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill that the concept of post-election
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
audits is sound
 
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.390 align:start position:0%
audits is sound
um

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i was on the committee conference
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
report that supported uh house bill
 
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.950 align:start position:0%
report that supported uh house bill
1467.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
1467.
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
i was a little disappointed in it i
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
don't think it went far enough but it's
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
a start
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i think we can learn from that start
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
actually the secretary of state
 
00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:09.430 align:start position:0%
actually the secretary of state
conducting

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
conducting
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
um an audit of election results
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
working with the uh city and town clerks
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
and moderators to make it occur
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
and finding out what kinds of equipment
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
will work and get a better understanding
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
of the cost
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
so hopefully after you know 1467 is
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
implemented we can grow with that
 
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.109 align:start position:0%
implemented we can grow with that
foundation

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
and do something more
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the national conference of state
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislators has some excellent
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
information on post-election audits and
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
what i found surprising is that there
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
are actually eight different types of
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
post-election audits
 
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.990 align:start position:0%
post-election audits
and

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
a value i think that any legislation
 
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.430 align:start position:0%
a value i think that any legislation
sponsors

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
be able to tell this committee
 
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
be able to tell this committee
why

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
one type of audit is better than another
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire and that kind of
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
research i think still needs to be done
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i would note that
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of only i think
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
seven states that don't have some kind
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
of post-election audit so i definitely
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
feel that there is a need to do so
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
there's one other thing i would like to
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
see in future legislation
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
a requirement that the state also
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
audit votes cast and towns and wards
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
that hand count their ballots
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
because it would be very easy to audit
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh the accubilt machines or any other
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
machine that's approved in the future
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
find out there's a there's a half of one
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
percent discrepancy and and have people
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
scream see it's not working
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
but if you're also auditing hand-counted
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
ballots and find that there's a three or
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
five percent discrepancy well then
 
00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
five percent discrepancy well then
suddenly

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
suddenly
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
the uh electronic
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
voting devices have more accuracy than
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
than hand counting and i can tell you
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
from my own experience that uh the the
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
biggest discrepancies were usually found
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
in recounts and vote involving
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
hand-counted ballots uh for those of you
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
that have done recounts you know that
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
you probably have two candidates running
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're sorting the ballots and stacks of
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
25. it's very easy to take a stack of 25
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
and put it in the wrong candidate's pile
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
and suddenly you have a swing of 50
 
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.790 align:start position:0%
and suddenly you have a swing of 50
votes

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
having that baseline to compare
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the differences in an audit for
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
hand-counted ballot towns with those
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
that use electronic
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh voting devices i think would have
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
some value in any kind of post-election
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
audit so again
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
i i certainly support the concept of
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
post-election audits uh i don't think
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
that this particular bill uh is is the
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
one to use to address it at this time
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
but i am certain this committee will
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
review other suggestions in the next
 
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.109 align:start position:0%
review other suggestions in the next
session

00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
all right the next bill we have in front
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
of us this morning is 5 51 relative to
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would require that the voter
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
registration database be made publicly
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
available in electronic format
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
provided that the secretary of state
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
could allow for limited
 
00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:20.870 align:start position:0%
could allow for limited
exceptions

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
fairly broad
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
it was an issue of costs there was an
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
issue from the secretary of state's
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
office in regards to the fact this dealt
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
with the harvard database which had felt
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
that some of the information on there
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
was confidential
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative sweeney thank
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um i do appreciate uh
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
the comparison chart that was produced
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
by christina
 
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.550 align:start position:0%
by christina
um

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
i know i believe i was the sponsor of hb
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
1010 and 223
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative barry who's
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
not here worked a lot on 1496 i believe
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
i helped him in his amendment language
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think in the last two years we've done
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
a lot on
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
voter people's access to
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
the voter rolls
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
1496 if signed
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
people can go to their supervisor or
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
their town and get the electronic list
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
of their checklist
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
there's access to
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
the checklist for folks that want it
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
we've made municipal voter history as
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
part of the statewide voter registration
 
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.190 align:start position:0%
part of the statewide voter registration
database

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
we've increased the access that the two
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
recognized political parties in the
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
state and any organized political
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
organization have to reach out to the
 
00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office and get the
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
voter data that they're inquiring about
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
so i do believe that we've made so many
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
significant changes over the last
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
two years on what we have access to and
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
what individuals have access to so i'm
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
spirit or the intent of 551 which as you
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
said was broad and
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
full sweeping i think a lot of the
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
concerns that people have we did address
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
through the other legislation that we
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
did pass so i'm not sure if when we're
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
talking later about what we want to
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
recommend i think
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
i think we might have covered it in
 
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
terms of what people were looking for in
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
terms of expanding access to the
 
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.390 align:start position:0%
terms of expanding access to the
information

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
so that's just one area where i think we
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
really did
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
um in a regulated you know particular
 
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.630 align:start position:0%
um in a regulated you know particular
way

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh get to the point of what the
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
original sponsors were trying to get
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
accomplished with 551
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's just my take representative
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
bergeron thank you madam chair
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
and and i agree with everything that
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney said
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
um i just for the record would like to
 
00:48:41.119 --> 00:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
um i just for the record would like to
mention

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.430 align:start position:0%
mention
or

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
define if i could what words like broad
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
and sweeping
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
mean since the chair and representative
 
00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.430 align:start position:0%
mean since the chair and representative
sweeney

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
sweeney
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
pension use those words
 
00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
pension use those words
the

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
legislation says that the voter database
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
shall be made electronically available
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
to members of the public
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
and that's not the same thing as the
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
checklist the voter database includes a
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
lot of elements a lot of fields of
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
information which contain
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
personal identifying information if
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
something as simple as dates of birth
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
for example which does not appear on the
 
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.710 align:start position:0%
for example which does not appear on the
checklist

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
one could argue that in addition to the
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
data fields
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
the voter database might include the the
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
coding the queries you know some of the
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
other software
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
um aspects that drive election net not
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
just the information that's contained
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
within it
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
so um i agree with representative
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
sweeney i think some progress has been
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
made in in making the checklists more
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
but this one is too broad in sweeping
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative moorhead was that a hand
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
that was that was glasses in the air and
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
a nod just nodding in in general
 
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.190 align:start position:0%
a nod just nodding in in general
affirmation

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
affirmation
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing no one is really talking
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
about is that this would provide
 
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:07.670 align:start position:0%
about is that this would provide
um

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
electronic access to a state database
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
that we don't currently allow and it
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
sort of has this
 
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.950 align:start position:0%
sort of has this
um

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
this line that sort of we really almost
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
didn't even discuss in regards to the
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
information it was going to provide
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
adequate technological security measures
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
to deter unu unauthorized access to the
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
records contained in the voter database
 
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.910 align:start position:0%
records contained in the voter database
um

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure it would be
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for a committee to pass
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
anything with that and the fiscal note
 
00:50:39.599 --> 00:50:40.870 align:start position:0%
anything with that and the fiscal note
um

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know what fiscal would what the
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
finance committee would do with this
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because the fiscal note only
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
addressed the loss of revenue
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
not the expense of implementing it
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
as if staff was just going to take on
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
this project and be able to work it into
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
its current day
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
and given the issues with security and
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
the concerns we've had about a portal
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
for election information i don't
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure that even if we all
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
agreed it was something that should
 
00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
agreed it was something that should
happen

00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know how with this bill you
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
could even get there
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative clearly
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes we had quite a lot of discussion on
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
this bill in in committee
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
and i recall very clearly that the
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
 
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.190 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill
himself

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
himself
 
00:51:25.349 --> 00:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
indicated that
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
his real intent was to have the
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
checklist information available readily
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
and he hadn't
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
i think i think i'll leave it at that
 
00:51:36.559 --> 00:51:37.829 align:start position:0%
i think i think i'll leave it at that
his

00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
his real interest was in the checklist
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
information not all the data in the
 
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
information not all the data in the
database

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.430 align:start position:0%
database
okay

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh which which means this bill has
 
00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.829 align:start position:0%
uh which which means this bill has
written

00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.790 align:start position:0%
written
uh

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's one that i would
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
consider recommending in its form and
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think if the sponsor brought forth
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
a variant of this where it's focused on
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
his real interest
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
that would be an interesting thing to
 
00:52:03.359 --> 00:52:04.470 align:start position:0%
that would be an interesting thing to
see

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
um the last bill i have that we have
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
remaining from the session
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
is the absentee ballot application form
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
this is sb 54.
 
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.069 align:start position:0%
this is sb 54.
um

00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
it is in regards to including certain
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
identity information for absentee
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
ballots uh we also had hb 144
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
which the senate simply none concurred
 
00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:37.030 align:start position:0%
which the senate simply none concurred
on

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.390 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
added

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license or some sort of
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
identification number the last four
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
digits of a social security number
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
or some sort of other information
 
00:52:50.319 --> 00:52:52.069 align:start position:0%
or some sort of other information
discussion

00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
i had been a co-sponsor on this bill
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
initially and
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
some excellent testimony was was brought
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
up during the um the public hearing and
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
subsequent discussions
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
there is a privacy concern regarding the
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
last four digits of an applicant's
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
social security number that's a
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
and also there's a question about the
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
availability of some of the
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
verifications we're asking for so
 
00:53:21.839 --> 00:53:23.109 align:start position:0%
verifications we're asking for so
um

00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
you know i um well i was originally a
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor i have misgivings about this
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill also and
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
obviously um
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
want to hear what everybody else thinks
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
but i i definitely this leads needs more
 
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.910 align:start position:0%
but i i definitely this leads needs more
work

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative bergeron
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative mcdonald and
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
we'll expand on it just a little bit
 
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.309 align:start position:0%
we'll expand on it just a little bit
um

00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
the last few lines of the bill say that
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
the town clerk is authorized to verify
 
00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
driver's license and non-driver's
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
picture id information
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
with the department of safety and was
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
brought up in testimony uh as
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonnell indicated that
 
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
the clerks don't necessarily have the
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
right to access this information for
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
this purpose
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
it also came out during testimony that
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
not all city clerks handle vehicle
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
registration so they don't have
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
authorization to enter the database at
 
00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:21.990 align:start position:0%
authorization to enter the database at
all

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
and i think we're all aware that
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
driver's license numbers are changing
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the driver's license
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
information that may be contained and
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
voters who registered maybe five years
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
or more
 
00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.030 align:start position:0%
or more
ago

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
would have a driver's license different
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
driver's license number different than
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
what they currently have on on their
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
license so this it'll be hard to verify
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
numbers that don't match up anymore
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
election net was established in 2006
 
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.270 align:start position:0%
election net was established in 2006
and

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
all the registered voter local databases
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
were migrated to election net in that
 
00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.109 align:start position:0%
were migrated to election net in that
time

00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and most of them did not include
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
driver's license information because
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
that requirement came about with the
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
national voter registration act
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
or java as some people refer to it
 
00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.109 align:start position:0%
or java as some people refer to it
and

00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of records election
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
records existing that
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
just doesn't contain driver's license
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
information anyway
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
so that's that's all i would
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
bring up on senate bill 54.
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a real id how does the
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
driver's license number differ on the
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
real id anybody know
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
i have one but i don't know
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
madam chair that just made me think
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering whether well i mean
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
just does it
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
is it do you know what did the number
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
you get does it's did it stay the same
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
no so it used to go by the name and date
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
of birth
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
and now it's just the break of a number
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
that's up with nhl right nhl yeah i used
 
00:55:55.839 --> 00:55:56.950 align:start position:0%
that's up with nhl right nhl yeah i used
to

00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
refresh your name
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
i kind of resented it when they gave me
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
this because i got my license in 1982 in
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
manchester and i had the same number the
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
whole time even when i moved back to the
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
state that gave me my old number and
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
then when i got my real id they gave me
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
this i can't always remember it because
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
of my birthday you know
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
jumble of your birthday right right
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
and now i got this long thing it means
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything so this is the new
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
administrative state's
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
solution to
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
real id
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
and so just
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody know if this d and i think
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
i know the answer this question if dmv
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
updates your driver's license number in
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
accordance with your new driver's
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
license does that automatically update
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
on other
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
departments databases
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
let me guess the answer to that one
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
government are talking
 
00:56:46.319 --> 00:56:47.430 align:start position:0%
government are talking
yeah

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
all right so that's i i hadn't even
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
thought of that when we were talking
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
about driver's license numbers all this
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
term in a number of cases whether it be
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
four or five digits because there was
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
some discussion about going to five
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
digits because the issue with four
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
digits is just like your birth date it's
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
filled and i had to go because
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
and there was another
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
gentleman with the same
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
initial and the same date of birth
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
numbers that they used they tried to
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
give me his license i said do i look
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
so
so

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
i think that's part of why we might have
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
seen some things talking about or her
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussion about using five digits for
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
the social security number
 
00:57:37.319 --> 00:57:38.829 align:start position:0%
the social security number
so

00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
um couple of issues with that
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
all right any further discussion for
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
what i noticed as a work session
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
um for these bills
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to take a break
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
till 10 past 11 and then we're gonna
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
exact all these bills
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%

seconds it
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
um did you want to speak to your motion
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative clearly
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes very briefly i think the concept
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
of post-election audits has a great deal
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
of merit
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh but would be worthwhile to institute
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
a procedure like that in this state
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
however i think the best approach would
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
be to start with a fresh bill rather
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
than try to continue with this one
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
