um

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan if you want to
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
Sure address this
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah let's do the Pledge of Allegiance
 
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
first okay
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
first sentence first
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to get to the flag
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the United States of America and to
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with
 
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.509 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:04.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:09.899 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm gonna move over here
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
so I can see everybody that that would
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
be better
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
so in in communication with
 
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative Vale
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the uh she has put together an
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
amendment that is identical to the last
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
version we saw with the exception of uh
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
lines 15 and 16.
 
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:43.820 align:start position:0%
which are a couple of other
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
exclusions this section shall not apply
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
to employees of Emergency Medical
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
Service law enforcement Public Safety
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
officials and firefighting service so uh
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
it seemed to her and I agreed with her
 
00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:00.730 align:start position:0%
it seemed to her and I agreed with her
that

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:00.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
excluding these folks from this was
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate and um
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that they were not covered by the uh
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
either 126x or the section
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
two that refers to federal law
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
regulations so
 
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.829 align:start position:0%
regulations so
um

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
with that change
 
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.009 align:start position:0%
with that change
um

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a little bit uh
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
narrower scope on on who's covered by
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
this and uh excuse me
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
I'm uh
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
I I also drawn to the uh testimony that
 
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
I I also drawn to the uh testimony that
Michael

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
Michael
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
trying to remember yes Mike Holt
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
um Gabe that this this is a relatively
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
small number of folks that that are
 
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
impacted by this and you know by having
 
00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
some exclusions the group gets
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
potentially even smaller I'm not really
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
sure if these exclusions actually not
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
touching anybody oh they're speak of the
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
um but uh at any rate uh
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
there's a copy of the uh there you go
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
no 15 and 16s are added
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
right the old 15 and 16 would be
 
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
something different
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
just bumped it down
 
00:12:37.380 --> 00:13:00.450 align:start position:0%
just bumped it down
foreign

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:00.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
we do have uh David Jewett here from uh
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association I'd
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
name is Dave Juve I'm a senior vice
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
president for public policy with the
 
00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association I
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
guess I would like to preface my remarks
 
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:41.339 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee understands the Bia
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
did not take a position on this bill I
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
was at the public hearing and thought
 
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
the the testimony was profound
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
um we did not testify we did not sign in
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
with a position and we're about as close
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
to neutral is an organization like mine
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
would be so I hope you'll take my
 
00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
comments in that Spirit
 
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.870 align:start position:0%
comments in that Spirit
um

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
my concern is that uh
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.060 align:start position:0%
could have
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
unforeseen uh consequences for some
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
employers and
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
if I were to make a request of the
 
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:25.740 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the committee
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
it would be to retain this bill because
 
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.590 align:start position:0%
it would be to retain this bill because
um

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
as with representative Cahill's bill on
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
on uh paid time off I think there's a
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
kernel of a good idea here that deserves
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
full consideration
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
and if the committee were disposed to
 
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:47.180 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill
 
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:50.540 align:start position:0%
we would offer up the expertise of our
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
employment attorneys to work with the
 
00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:55.129 align:start position:0%
employment attorneys to work with the
committee

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
um in in a
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
proactive way not not to to kill the
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
bill but to try and come up with a bill
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
that everybody
 
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:09.710 align:start position:0%
thinks would work best
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.069 align:start position:0%
thinks would work best
[Music]

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know what what I do for a living is
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
I have to look at the politics of a
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
situation and
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
if the committee votes on this bill even
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
with this clarifying Amendment
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
if it comes out with a 10 to 10 without
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation and goes to the house
 
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
floor that way it's anybody's guess what
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:35.459 align:start position:0%
and frankly I think it would be
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if the bill were to be itl'd
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
on on the house floor because then you
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
have to start all over again whereas if
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
you retain a bill and everyone works
 
00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:47.339 align:start position:0%
cooperatively on it obviously you don't
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
have to start from scratch
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
if it were to pass the house
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
my observation is it would have a real
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
uphill fight in the Senate
 
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
and would possibly be a bill that the
 
00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:04.019 align:start position:0%
governor would consider consider vetoing
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
obviously that's all speculation but I
 
00:16:07.079 --> 00:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
obviously that's all speculation but I
guess

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
if it were me I'd like to err on the
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
side of safety and and have the bill
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
retained so we can all work on it and
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
then cooperatively come forward in
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
January of next year with something that
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees is workable just one
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
last comment on on the amendment which
 
00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sullivan I just
 
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:35.180 align:start position:0%
saw it and I understand the um
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
point that has been made on lines 15 and
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
16 but again it raises questions because
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other types of
 
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
employment that could have impact on the
 
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:50.420 align:start position:0%
public like school bus drivers or
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
cab drivers or snow plow drivers
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
I could probably go on and on but my
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
point is
 
00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
if we're carving out this exemption for
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
these types of employment
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't other types of employment that
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
could impact Public Safety also be
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
considered and that's an example of
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
why I think if we if we
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like we were in a rush to to
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
try and get this through this session
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
with all the risks that that involves
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
maybe if if everybody sits down
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
including really smart attorneys who
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
represent employers
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can come up with something
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
good and I will tell you I sent out
 
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.470 align:start position:0%
good and I will tell you I sent out
recently

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.250 align:start position:0%
recently
um

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
an email to to the employer
 
00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.510 align:start position:0%
an email to to the employer
um

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:46.940 align:start position:0%
either HR
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
managers VPS and employment attorneys
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
asking their opinion on the bill because
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
I have to tell you it first blush the
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill which is a relatively simple one is
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
not one that left me with a lot of angst
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
and the responses I got back which I
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
would like to forward to all of you so
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
you can see a more interesting because
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
they ran the gamut from some HR managers
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
who acknowledged look
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
this is an issue we're going to have to
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
deal with in one form or another
 
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.370 align:start position:0%
deal with in one form or another
eventually

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
to another attorney who suggested well
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
there's a recent New Hampshire uh
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that acknowledged
 
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.409 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that acknowledged
that

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:29.419 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
cannabis for medical use could be part
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
of a reasonable accommodation on the
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
part of employers to a third attorney
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
that said you know the devil's kind of
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
in the detail so my point is
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
I guess this Echoes why we didn't have a
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
strong position one way or the other
 
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:49.940 align:start position:0%
even with HR professionals representing
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
employers there there are positions all
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
over the Spectrum on this bill so that
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
can I I don't know if that's helpful I'd
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
be happy to try and answer any questions
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
but those are my thoughts
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that we did at
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
our last meeting
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
and I've done quite a bit since is look
 
00:19:20.049 --> 00:19:20.059 align:start position:0%
very carefully at section 126 x colon 3
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the rsas and that is the prohibitions
 
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
and limitations on the therapeutic use
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
of cannabis so
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
when you look at this
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
with this
it

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think it would it should relieve
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
anything not I won't say it will relieve
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
all anxiety because we're all a little
 
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.930 align:start position:0%
all anxiety because we're all a little
anxious

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
anxious
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
um but it should relieve
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of anxiety
 
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:50.210 align:start position:0%
a lot of anxiety
um

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
because uh essentially
 
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.570 align:start position:0%
because uh essentially
um

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I might lean on Michael hold a
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
little bit here
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
um because we've spent a fair bit of
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
time talking about the difference
 
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
between Under the Influence versus
 
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:08.710 align:start position:0%
between Under the Influence versus
um

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
impaired right and arguably somebody
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
with THC in their system
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
well I know I think you're you're not
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
under the influence long
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
um long before THC flushes out of the
 
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but at the same time
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's using therapeutic cannabis
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
um at some point when it's taking taking
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
its therapeutic course one is
 
00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:48.299 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence but they are not
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
um intended to be impaired
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
um the the objective is
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
deal with the
 
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
deal with the
um symptoms

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
um symptoms
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
but stay short of impairment
 
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.130 align:start position:0%
but stay short of impairment
um

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:05.029 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
um says that nothing this chapter shall
 
00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:09.299 align:start position:0%
exempt any person from arrest or
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
prosecution for operating a motor
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle commercial vehicle boat vessel
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
or any other vehicle propelled or drawn
 
00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
by power other than muscular power
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
um so we're talking about cab drivers
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
and um that type of thing they're
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
already addressed under um 126 X3
 
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.770 align:start position:0%
already addressed under um 126 X3
um

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
when it comes to other types of
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
employment operating heavy machinery or
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
handling dangerous instrumentality
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
so people on the job who are you know at
 
00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:50.539 align:start position:0%
a heightened level of safety concern
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
certainly are excluded from
 
00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
certainly are excluded from
um

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.730 --> 00:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
being in the in or are not protected by
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
the the bill by itself leaves a lot of
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions the bill in
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
combination with 126 X3 I believe leaves
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
far far far fewer questions
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so um I would argue that this um
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
I mean if you if you ask people
 
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.970 align:start position:0%
I mean if you if you ask people
um

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.730 align:start position:0%
um
cold

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:27.740 align:start position:0%
cold
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
whether they'd have any concerns just
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
reading this
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
um they probably will if they are given
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to carefully study the
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
126x3 along with the bill
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
um I think they should have a lot of
 
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
their concerns alleviated
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
that's possible I I will admit I only
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
sent out the original language of the
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
bill because frankly I didn't know that
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
the amendment existed and this is our
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment so
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
um yeah it it it's tightened it up
 
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.409 align:start position:0%
um yeah it it it's tightened it up
substantially

00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and um I I think we've been working
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
on it and um you know these these folks
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
need protection as you pointed out there
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
is a Supreme Court case that protects
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
um someone's rights to uh accommodation
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately their protection comes
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
to the courts which is a pretty painful
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
way of getting there if you are of
 
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
limited means
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
um you can't afford the lawyers that are
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
going to get you uh
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
um your resolution so it it it's a
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
relatively small group of people who are
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
on the program and employed
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
um and there are a lot of folks who are
 
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.930 align:start position:0%
um and there are a lot of folks who are
um

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
who are already separated out either
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
through what's in the bill
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
or through what's
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
in the original uh statute yeah
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not arguing with any of that and
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
again I want to stress I'm not here
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill I hear you um I'm here
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
to offer our resources if the committee
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:07.029 align:start position:0%
would like to
um

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
improve it and maybe it's been improved
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it could be I don't
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
know because I you know I'd like to send
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
the amended language out this afternoon
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
and get some comments on that and I
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
guess when you started your testimony my
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
original thinking was what exactly needs
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
to be improved and I am I correct that
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
we don't you don't presently have an
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
answer to that
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
they're not that I'm comfortable
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
expressing to the subcommittee what I am
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
comfortable in doing is sending you the
 
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:42.430 align:start position:0%
comfortable in doing is sending you the
unedited

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
unedited
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
emails that I got back and you'll see
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
that they're all over the map and then
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
you could make a decision on your own
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
whether the amendment has addressed
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
those concerns or not I think that'd be
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
great to have
 
00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.870 align:start position:0%
great to have
sure

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for taking my question so
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
on the Second Amendment I'm um I'm still
 
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:04.740 align:start position:0%
having a problem with the the no
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
employer shall deny employment I was
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
hoping that that was going to be removed
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
from this amendment because I I feel
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
strongly that we should not be
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
legislating at that level they should be
 
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
able to make a decision based off of
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
their circumstances and when I reached
 
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
out to the employers that
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I have in the my district
 
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.370 align:start position:0%
um I have in the my district
um

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
with the exception of one who was
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with smoking marijuana
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
and things that should be legal
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
everybody else was against this bill and
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
asked me to continue to oppose it
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
um so as long as that denying employment
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
is in there I'm not going to be in favor
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
um and the further thing that I thought
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
about after leaving here at the last
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
session and talking with somebody else I
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
reflected a lot on
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
this whole the the the uh
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
advocating that people will not be
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
taking this while they're at work that
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
they know better that they can't take
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
this while they're at work
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
and what was said was if these people
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
are so uncomfortable or in so much pain
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
or having trouble dealing with whatever
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
their issue is that they need to be on
 
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.890 align:start position:0%
their issue is that they need to be on
cannabis

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
then how is it that they can get through
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
a 10 or an eight hour shift without
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
being on cannabis but they can't make it
 
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
through the night before or the day
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
before or the weekend
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
um and you know that made a lot of sense
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
to me so how is it that they can manage
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
to carve out a 10-hour part of their day
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
where they have no pain and no issue
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
that they don't need to to medicate
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
themselves I find that hard to accept I
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
think that they are so um as much as the
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
law says they shouldn't be and as much
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
as it's written that they shouldn't be
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
in action can be taken I think that it's
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
very naive of us to think that canvas
 
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
users who have a card who are taking it
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
for pain management or for
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
um anxiety or other mental health issues
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
I think it's naive us to think that
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
they're not taking that during the day
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
when they're at work
 
00:27:05.049 --> 00:27:05.059 align:start position:0%
is that so Sullivan
 
00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:07.559 align:start position:0%
I had a feeling that you might still be
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
a have concerns about the hiring issue
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
I gave a lot of thought to that between
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
then and now and concluded especially
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
after looking looking and thinking about
 
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.169 align:start position:0%
after looking looking and thinking about
other

00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:27:21.179 --> 00:27:22.789 align:start position:0%
other
um uh

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh issues of discrimination
 
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:28.820 align:start position:0%
basically discrimination
 
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:30.669 align:start position:0%
basically discrimination
protections

00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
always include hiring and on the job
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
if you find out that someone that you
 
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
just made a job offer to has a
 
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.010 align:start position:0%
just made a job offer to has a
disability

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
that doesn't stop them from doing the
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
job but might require an accommodation
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
you can't just decide not to hire them
 
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
you can't just decide not to hire them
anymore

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's standard discrimination policy so
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
um I reached the point where for me I
 
00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:06.659 align:start position:0%
know where you're at I understand it I
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
respect it but
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
for me you I can't
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
accept having this
 
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.230 align:start position:0%
accept having this
anti-discrimination

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
bill be different from any every other
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
form of discrimination where
 
00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:23.149 align:start position:0%
form of discrimination where
um

00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
you can't discriminate if they're
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
already on the job but you can
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
discriminate if it's in the middle of
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
the hiring process so uh to me that's
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
um a showstopper
 
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
um and and to address the other piece
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
in reality
 
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
in reality
um

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
126 X3 does allow
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
someone to use
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis on the job as long as you have
 
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:51.980 align:start position:0%
the written permission of your employer
 
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
without that you can't
 
00:28:59.930 --> 00:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
um and um you can have it on on the job
 
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
site with the written permission of your
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
employer if you don't get that written
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
permission you can't have it on the site
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
and there are two two different written
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
permissions one to to be under the
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
influence the other two
 
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.970 align:start position:0%
influence the other two
um

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
to actually have it on the job site so
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
number one you can and number two with
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
regard to those who use it at night
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
um I I can just give you my personal
 
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
situation without going into gory
 
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:29.570 align:start position:0%
situation without going into gory
details

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
details
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
um but basically when I got the card
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
which is expired by the way it's it's it
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
it was yeah it was kind of cool to have
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
but the um I'll keep in my wallet for
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
another 10 years
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
my issue is sleeping at night the
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
symptoms I had that I got the card for I
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
still have those symptoms
 
00:29:59.220 --> 00:29:59.870 align:start position:0%
still have those symptoms
um

00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
last night was not good I was in the
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
recliner all night
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
um and I wish I had something that could
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
have resolved it right now I'm here do I
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
have symptoms yes but they're not as bad
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
when I'm awake
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm alone with that I
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
think others share that situation and
 
00:30:20.889 --> 00:30:20.899 align:start position:0%
essentially really need help sleeping
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
and that was a situation I was in
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and by God hopefully not too much
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
longer but I'm still in it so it that
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
that really does exist and people who
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
have symptoms that need to be resolved
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
during the night so they can get a good
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
night's sleep
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
um it it's a real thing so um I'll just
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
put that out there
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
everything called
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to follow up on the reasonable
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation the reasonable
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
accommodation is unless the employer can
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the accommodation would
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
impose an undue hardship on the
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
operation of its business and when
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at electricians and crane
 
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
operators and HVAC technicians and a lot
 
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
of the trades I would argue that making
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
an accommodation for cannabis use would
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
be an undue hardship based off of just
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
the the SEC the safety needs that are
 
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940 align:start position:0%
that are needed in those jobs and in
 
00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
those trades so
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm sorry to disappoint I I don't
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
disagree with Dave as far as retaining
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
this because the deny employment is a
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
hard stop for me I you know I'm gonna
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna vote against this and I will
 
00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:30.659 align:start position:0%
Advocate against this because of the
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
denying employment I just don't think we
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
should be putting those types of
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
handcuffs on our employers and and I
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
guess I would argue that you're right
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
about the accommodations
 
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
um if and basically it's already in
 
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.710 align:start position:0%
um if and basically it's already in
yeah

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
I I thought it sounded good uh the
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
um but basically it's already in 126a I
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
haven't I read it short while ago if I
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
can find it again
 
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.769 align:start position:0%
can find it again
um

00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
the sausage operating heavy machinery or
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
handling and dangerous instrumentality
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
so essentially you know those employers
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
employees who are um
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
in those situations
 
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940 align:start position:0%
um can be excluded from this
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
um so I I I I think that piece is not a
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
concern for me the hiring is not a
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
concern for you it is I get it but um
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
I would hope that we could narrow our
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I've got I've got my my
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
concerns still uh you know we we have
 
00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
two lines here with the the to uh exempt
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
employee different employment
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing I could probably add
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
another 75 lines to it
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
um you know uh I I go back to Justice
 
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:53.220 align:start position:0%
Scalia saying the the Constitution says
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
what it says and it doesn't say what it
 
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't say this bill says what it says
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say what it doesn't say
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
and those the the things uh
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
representative cocom just outlined uh
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
this this dozens more uh I could go as
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
far as uh somebody sitting at a computer
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
that and making a you know a very very
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
Hefty Financial mistake
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
um you know the the employer has no has
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
no recourse uh you know uh I don't think
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
we can't go there uh
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know we we argued about
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
um about uh you know people on this in
 
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
this program a lot of them wouldn't
 
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
but a lot of them would too
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know um but I don't I don't want to
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
say you know I have this card you can't
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
do a Don thing to me
 
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't I don't think we we
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
should be doing that to employers
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
and um you know I'm I'm still I made
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
that motion to retain this needs an
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
awful lot of work it um
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
you know like I said we we could add 75
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
more lines of uh of occupations that uh
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
should be exempt
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I've I've got a friend that
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
uh I saw him the other night he lost his
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
arm he was uh doing a siding job he was
 
00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
his own employer okay I won't work with
 
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
this guy because uh he does everything
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
to Don fast okay their absent-minded
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
ADHD all that kind of stuff but that's
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
kind of the symptoms that a somebody
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
that just smoked a jointed have the
 
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
and he put up some some staging and uh
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
some pump staging I don't know if
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
anybody's familiar with it but you know
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
it's good arms that uh that connected to
 
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:28.740 align:start position:0%
the building well he missed a stud and
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
he put a bolt through some OSB that the
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
the follow particle board
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
and he goes up on the stage and a tour
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
off the wall and he came down and he
 
00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
didn't you know he he broke his arm but
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
he ended up losing the arm but I don't
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
want that you know if he was an employee
 
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay and and there's you know three or
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
four guys on a on a on a crew and one of
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
them smoked a joint for lunch you know
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
and he's got this card uh and he missed
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
the he missed the stud and just put it
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
into the OSB like Tommy did uh you know
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
where does that leave the employer
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
you know uh it's we're going we're
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
opening up a nasty can of worms here I
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
think that I spoke with the the
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner's office uh a
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
lawyer there uh but uh you know he said
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the insurance commission's office
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
had no no position on it but he and I
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
spoke of this type of stuff and uh you
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
know this needs an awful lot of work I
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
guess for me until we until we can tell
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
whether you
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know smoked a joint last night
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
but you know three and a half minutes
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
before you punched in uh you know we're
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
gonna have trouble
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to see any employer a
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
small businessman uh losing his home
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
over it you know and I I can see the
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
ugliness of that coming up
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know another another quote that I I
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
like is Lyndon Baines Johnson
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know when considering legislation we
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
not only have to look at all the good
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
it'll do if it's implemented rightly but
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
more importantly all the bad it'll do if
 
00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's implemented wrongly and this just
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
this this just has all kinds of holes to
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
implement it wrongly
 
00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at a different way
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I think we have
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
when I was reading this information I
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
think there's 25 states that do it
 
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.930 align:start position:0%
think there's 25 states that do it
um

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
so they they're able to figure it out I
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
think the last bill we had and last time
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
this bill came in I think what we tried
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
doing really wanted to build down too
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
much was to have all these carbots
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
but I go back to this whole thing and
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm you know because it just seems like
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
and I respect everybody's opinion but we
 
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:35.940 align:start position:0%
seem to get fixated on this whole thing
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
of you know whether they're going to do
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
it before work whether they're going to
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
do it you know at night and I'll tell
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
you right now
 
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.890 align:start position:0%
you right now
um

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
from someone that you want to talk about
 
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
sleep deprivation where can the fire
 
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:49.140 align:start position:0%
service for 30 years and somebody told
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
me when the day I retired that my sleep
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
was going to get better well it's been
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
almost seven years and I can guarantee
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
you that my sleep is no better
 
00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.530 align:start position:0%
you that my sleep is no better
um

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:58.970 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:36:58.970 --> 00:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
if sleep deprivation was part of the
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program I think I'd
 
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
probably be a card holding member
 
00:37:11.569 --> 00:37:11.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
but on the other
 
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
on the other side I mean I look at and
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
what my
 
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative colcum was talking about
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I understand you know we don't know
 
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.430 align:start position:0%
and I understand you know we don't know
um

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
if somebody's using at night or
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
somebody's using it during the day but I
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
think we can say the same thing about
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
opioids and I think again if we go back
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
to these opioids I think a lot of times
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
that people are trying to get what
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
getting on the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
program is to get away from the opioids
 
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't test somebody at work
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge for the use of opioids
 
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
in any accident
 
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:55.940 align:start position:0%
any industrial accident and in
 
00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:57.900 align:start position:0%
occupations that I've been involved in
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
with it I won't say any so and I'm gonna
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
I will say this
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
because there is a way that they can
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
test to see how much cannabis is in your
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
system because I've had a discussion uh
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
with a very good friend of mine and it
 
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:15.980 align:start position:0%
would come from a blood draw
 
00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
the reality of it is I think that's very
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to get but in the case of an
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
accident an incident that may have
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
harmed somebody at work
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
I don't think it'd be treated any
 
00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:32.339 align:start position:0%
differently than a DWI that hurts
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
somebody so if they really wanted to get
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
down to the nuts and bolts of it and
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
find out if that person was impaired
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
there is a way they can do it and they
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
can find out and yeah it's going to work
 
00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
but again it's no different than it's no
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
different than the DWI where somebody's
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
going to get hurt so
 
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.190 align:start position:0%
going to get hurt so
um

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
I like the bill do I think there's some
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
things that we could work on I do but
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
again my belief is if 25 States in this
 
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
country have done it and we don't see it
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's not exploding on the TV every night
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not watching TV and saying you know
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
oh Rhode Island had this massive you
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
know accident at work incident because
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
somebody was smoking cannabis I I don't
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
see it I just I don't see it happening
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
so I don't really think it's creating a
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
big issue but I respect everybody's
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
opinion and respect you know and I would
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
definitely encourage us to continue
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
working on this because I do think this
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
is something that
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
um we should move forward
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you when I uh when I was speaking
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
to the uh the insurance commissioner's
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
office lawyer there uh you know we
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
talked about the the other states that
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
have it and everything and uh he said
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
it's he figured it was only a matter of
 
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:45.260 align:start position:0%
time before you know whether it's a a
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
you know a workers comp case or or just
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
um you know liability cases it's only a
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
matter of time before all those things
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
start rearing their ugly head uh
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
I think we need to work on this and
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.609 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
um

00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to make a couple
 
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.990 align:start position:0%
I guess I'd like to make a couple
suggestions

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
um I did talk with uh chairman infantine
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
at length last night and um
 
00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:17.339 align:start position:0%
I think he and I agree that if the bill
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
is going to be retained we'd rather do
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
that with the full committee rather than
 
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.190 align:start position:0%
that with the full committee rather than
here

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
um and I guess what I'd like to make
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
sure we do here is if we as a
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
subcommittee feel that this amendment is
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
an improvement over a the original Bill
 
00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
and B the um uh the earlier amendment I
 
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:38.940 align:start position:0%
would suggest that we adopt the
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
amendment or recommend adoption of the
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
amendment so we're moving
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
we know what to look at when we get back
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
to the committee I don't think we want
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
to be looking at the original bill
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
because I think the sponsors didn't feel
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
like the original bill was well crafted
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
so I would hate to be back at that point
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
because I I would argue and I'd hope
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
folks could agree that this amendment is
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
better and this happens sometimes I've
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
done it I voted I think we've done it as
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
a committee this year we voted in favor
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
of an amendment that improves a bill
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
than people in the vote on
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is amended may vote
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
against that as a resolution so
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest Mr chairman that may
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we take up the amendment in terms
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
of whether or not this is Improvement
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
I did hear representative Holcomb and I
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
think I was clear with my view on the
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
hiring aspect
 
00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.370 align:start position:0%
hiring aspect
um

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
I believe you would prefer something
 
00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:45.380 align:start position:0%
that didn't include hiring I can't
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
accept something that excludes hiring so
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's I think where we are with the
 
00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.310 align:start position:0%
that's I think where we are with the
subcommittee

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.109 align:start position:0%
um and um
uh

00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
unless both of my other colleagues feel
 
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
one way or the other unanimously and I
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
suspect that's not the case
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
um but I can I only get one vote
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
um my suggestion is to take up the
 
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.650 align:start position:0%
um my suggestion is to take up the
amendment

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
no it's always been my understanding
 
00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
that a subcommittee like this is uh only
 
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh suggestive you know recommendation
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
I see the amendment is better but still
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
far from what we need and uh you know we
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
can certainly bring this this amendment
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the full committee and uh you
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
know use this as part of the uh you know
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
the the the the motion to retain but uh
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
you know have this as part of the uh the
 
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
the thing we're going to work with
 
00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.210 align:start position:0%
the thing we're going to work with
um

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
you know but uh I'd still uh like to
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to to retain
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
and um you know as far as a
 
00:42:56.099 --> 00:42:57.309 align:start position:0%
and um you know as far as a
yeah

00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion that we retain uh
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
Hospital 82
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
with the Second Amendment
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
um back to the committee
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a matter of procedure you can't
 
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.690 align:start position:0%
as a matter of procedure you can't
retain

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.890 align:start position:0%
retain
um

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
with uh the amendment the amendment has
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
um adopted
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
so if we're retaining we'd be retaining
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion that we retain House
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
Bill 82
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
I vote does not carry
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
I guess I would make a motion to adopt
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
um as presented
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
and again I would encourage the
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee to just consider that we're
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
upgrading the bill to a better form
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
perhaps not a perfect form
 
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
about now
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative Susie yes
 
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I vote Yes and
 
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going back to committee uh
 
00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:39.560 align:start position:0%
with a hung jury and
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
I could I think that's fine we can um
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
we've got an exact session next week and
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
we can um work it out there I
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
I would argue
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm arguing again
 
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.250 align:start position:0%
I'm arguing again
um

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
um that we've not wasted our time I
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
think we've had uh
 
00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.490 align:start position:0%
think we've had uh
um

00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
lots of discussion I think um we have
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
made progress
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
um and um I would you know be intend to
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
bring this amendment to the uh the full
 
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.650 align:start position:0%
bring this amendment to the uh the full
committee

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and see where it lands but um
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
and and we'll see where it goes I it
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
will not be the end of the world if it
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
gets retained
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
are looking to maintain an employed
 
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
status without the threat of um
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
of termination or discipline I think
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
this is important today not uh a year
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
from now so that's that's why I feel
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
that moving forward would be a good
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
thing and I firmly believe that the
 
00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.109 align:start position:0%
thing and I firmly believe that the
amendment

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
along with
 
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:47.990 align:start position:0%
along with
um

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
um RSA 126x3 in combination
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
um do a good job of
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
getting us as close as we can to where
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
we need to be I also suggest Mr javet
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
that if you can send that information to
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
us that would be terrific
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman make a quick
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
comment yes um yeah I will do that
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I'll uh send it
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
to all four of you and copy chairman
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
infantine on it just so he's aware of it
 
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
and I will also send out the language of
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and ask for comments on
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
that and see if that changes uh people's
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
opinion but you'll see when you get the
 
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
emails there were some of our members
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
who didn't have a problem with the bill
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the fence and some thought
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
it could create problems
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
just one question would the other
 
00:46:44.089 --> 00:46:44.099 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here the uh
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
willing to uh to amend the amendment I
 
00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:50.339 align:start position:0%
guess uh on lines 15 and 16 uh to
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
or any any occupation uh that uh or any
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
anything that would uh put the the life
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
and safety uh of of others at risk
 
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.329 align:start position:0%
and safety uh of of others at risk
um

00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know put something in there for for
 
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
you know put something in there for for
uh

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
you know maybe Financial
 
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:14.750 align:start position:0%
you know maybe Financial
um

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
who to me we've got to expand those
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
those two lines I I guess I would um
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
look back to the original
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
um bill as introduced
 
00:47:29.819 --> 00:47:30.710 align:start position:0%
um bill as introduced
um

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
it has a line in there that says this
 
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740 align:start position:0%
section shall not apply to employment or
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
drug screening tests are required for
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
the safety of persons and property at
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
the job site
 
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.170 align:start position:0%
the job site
um

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
concluded at the outset that that
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
language which is somewhat similar to
 
00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
what you just suggested is so vague and
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
so broad that it would exclude virtually
 
00:47:54.119 --> 00:47:55.609 align:start position:0%
so broad that it would exclude virtually
everyone

00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so um we were immediately asked not
 
00:48:01.609 --> 00:48:01.619 align:start position:0%
to act on
 
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced and I think
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we're we're at risk of if we
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
use General language
 
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.809 align:start position:0%
use General language
um

00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
an employer could say everyone is
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
excluded no one on our job site can
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
um be part of the program
 
00:48:20.089 --> 00:48:20.099 align:start position:0%
um if um if we use specific language and
 
00:48:22.569 --> 00:48:22.579 align:start position:0%
say this list of 75
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
job descriptions
 
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.910 align:start position:0%
job descriptions
um

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh are excluded
 
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
uh are excluded
um

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.829 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
the 76th will come in and there will be
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
an issue because it's assumed that if
 
00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:39.740 align:start position:0%
you have an exhaustive list of uh
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
employment that is excluded that
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
everything else is included
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
um and there's uh a lot of risk in doing
 
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.140 align:start position:0%
that so I think we want to avoid
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
extremely broad language or extremely
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
specific language so the bill is
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
and and and I would again point out that
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of employment types are already
 
00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.309 align:start position:0%
a lot of employment types are already
Exempted

00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.030 align:start position:0%
Exempted
um

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
by the uh by the bill I would encourage
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
everyone to read that and it and I would
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that 126 X3
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
difficult to read
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's no indentations
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
makes it hard to figure out where one
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
section begins the next one begin
 
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.329 align:start position:0%
section begins the next one begin
um

00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
um and so so it it it is difficult to
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
read but if you read it carefully there
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
are a lot a lot of types of employment
 
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
that are already
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
excluded so um
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
that's really important to uh to look at
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
because we don't have to read in fact
 
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.230 align:start position:0%
because we don't have to read in fact
frankly

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
um in talking to the sponsor yesterday
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
there was an urge to repeat something
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's already in 126 X3 I think that's
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
a big mistake because if you say it one
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
way in one section of the law and
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
another way in another section of law
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
you don't know which one takes the
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
precedent so um you know to repeat
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
what's in already in the statute for the
 
00:50:19.089 --> 00:50:19.099 align:start position:0%
purpose of uh
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
emphasis is a bad idea basically we've
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
got 126 X3 and we've got uh the bill
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's before us and the two should not
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
overlap we should be careful about that
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
see my problem is uh you know a lot of
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
industrial accidents happen in the
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
construction trades yeah we haven't even
 
00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:42.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned them
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm sure they are not
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
specifically construction but again
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
operating heavy machinery that's happens
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
in construction or handling a dangerous
 
00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:54.290 align:start position:0%
in construction or handling a dangerous
instrumentality

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
instrumentality
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
um that's all kinds of
 
00:50:56.099 --> 00:50:57.829 align:start position:0%
um that's all kinds of
um uh

00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh two tools on the job site that could
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.079 --> 00:51:08.329 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:08.339 --> 00:51:12.190 align:start position:0%
um
liability

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
does it say that
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're in section three it
 
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
specifically says it's referring to
 
00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:25.010 align:start position:0%
specifically says it's referring to
employment

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
so just because somebody's arrested or
 
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:28.130 align:start position:0%
so just because somebody's arrested or
prosecuted

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're necessarily
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to lose their job over this but
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
so there's so many holes on this that
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
we need to retain it and work on it and
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
close those holes
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
we feel that some positions are more
 
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
sensitive than others that they would be
 
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.410 align:start position:0%
sensitive than others that they would be
excluded

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
you know why why do we feel that other
 
00:51:55.849 --> 00:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
positions are not worthy of being
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
excluded permits because essentially the
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
employer is required to make
 
00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:02.750 align:start position:0%
employer is required to make
accommodation

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
um the requirement requirement to make
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
an accommodation if if you're a truck
 
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.010 align:start position:0%
an accommodation if if you're a truck
driver

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
driver
 
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.410 align:start position:0%
driver
um

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:11.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
you can't accommodate that um
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
however if you are
 
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
um uh on the construction job site lots
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
of accommodations can be made to avoid
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
certain types of uh activities so
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
um because as I said someone who's got a
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
shovel in his hand and digging a hole is
 
00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.089 align:start position:0%
shovel in his hand and digging a hole is
not

00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
um uh in need of accommodation and
 
00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:42.260 align:start position:0%
someone who is running a
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
dangerous powered equipment might be
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
reassigned to the shovel rather than the
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh equipment so you know those
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
are the types of accommodations that
 
00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
employers can make
 
00:52:53.579 --> 00:52:54.470 align:start position:0%
employers can make
um

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bit of a pain it's a
 
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
nuisance it's an inconvenience but
 
00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.099 align:start position:0%
that's what our non-dis um
 
00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:03.650 align:start position:0%
that's what our non-dis um
anti-discrimination

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
um uh laws do
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
um they protect people and let them stay
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
on the job with reasonable reasonable
 
00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:12.170 align:start position:0%
on the job with reasonable reasonable
accommodations

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
accommodations
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
and would we run into the problem of an
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
excavator operator uh making 75 dollars
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
an hour reduced to a guy shoveling
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's making 17 an hour and uh you know
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
that there's another can of worms that
 
00:53:26.569 --> 00:53:26.579 align:start position:0%
those are issues that need to be
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
resolved sure
 
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
well I I could see the excavator
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
operator that can no longer operate that
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
still wanting his 75 dollars an hour and
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
and try to try and litigate that or go
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
through a union union repunion uh
 
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.710 align:start position:0%
through a union union repunion uh
agreements

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.250 align:start position:0%
agreements
um

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm sorry we're pretty informal
 
00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:09.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
you've got a basis you know what that
 
00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.069 align:start position:0%
you've got a basis you know what that
employee

00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know you know what their performance
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
is like you can have something to
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
measure number
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
when you're being forced to hire
 
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.010 align:start position:0%
when you're being forced to hire
somebody

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
when it's against your local policy and
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
your practices because we have to now
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
Force this law down their throat that
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
they must fire if they can't find a
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation or a reason why
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
they are excluded for the reasonable
 
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.130 align:start position:0%
they are excluded for the reasonable
Foundation

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
Foundation
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
they have no basis they're going on on
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
the interview process which is typically
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
a few hours talking to you know a few
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
people a few hours in in somebody's
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
selling themselves up we all know a very
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
difficulty you make it and not every job
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
can be a vacancy and make a type of job
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
and I just don't think we should be
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
you know if there's personal
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility in this and if if I have
 
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
a cannabis card and I have to take
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
cannabis for whatever the reason I have
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
a personal responsibility and my
 
00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
responsibility is also to keep my job
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
and ownership is on me I should not be
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
expecting the employer to be forced to
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
keep me and I don't think we should
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
expect any employer to be divorced to
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
keep somebody it's personal
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have you know we can't
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
legislate away from personal
 
00:55:21.599 --> 00:55:24.470 align:start position:0%
legislate away from personal
responsibility

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:27.780 align:start position:0%
but again and I'll go back to this
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
there's nothing saying because somebody
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
has therapeutic cannabis card that
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to be
 
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence or impaired at work
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
if somebody goes for an interview right
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
somebody goes for an interview and we I
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
think we had discussion
 
00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.390 align:start position:0%
think we had discussion
and

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
they were the best candidate
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
they were the best candidate by far and
 
00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:51.300 align:start position:0%
because they all of a sudden take out
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
I have a problem with that because if
 
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:00.300 align:start position:0%
they were overall they obviously had the
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
ability to go in and I think somebody
 
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:04.670 align:start position:0%
ability to go in and I think somebody
that

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
I truly believe that if somebody has to
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
do gummies if they have to smoke
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana if it has to be all the time
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be able to go
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
through a interview and be the best
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
candidate if they have to be on this
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
stuff all the time
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
so I think it's I understand what you're
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
saying but I think I mean
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see how much is happening
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
right now I mean dick it could be going
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
on right now just because we want to
 
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
bring this law forward
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
now it's becoming a problem I can
 
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee it's probably happened in the
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
workplace right now and we don't know
 
00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
so I I don't really think it's a bad
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
thing I think it's it's trying to get
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
people back to work
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
um and again they're not gonna they will
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
be there'll be carve outs but I just
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:54.349 align:start position:0%
think that
um

00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
I think it's not giving these people a
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
fair shot at employment
 
00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.150 align:start position:0%
fair shot at employment
um

00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
especially if they come out and they're
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
the top candidate I just don't believe
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
that somebody that may have eaten a five
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
milligram gummy at night is going to be
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
affected the next morning an interview
 
00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.470 align:start position:0%
affected the next morning an interview
so

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
it may be that the employer still
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
chooses to hire that person right so I
 
00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:20.579 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that by taking this out
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
the employer is automatically not going
 
00:57:24.049 --> 00:57:24.059 align:start position:0%
to there are going to be some employers
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
who won't because that's their policy
 
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and it may be because their worker
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
comp claims it could be for a lot of
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
reasons it could just be the nature of
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
the work
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
but leaving it up to their decision
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
is where I think it needs to be I I
 
00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you I think that
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
there's a population of people who
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
um are not affected at work to the
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
extent of what maybe we want to over
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
dramatize it to be but um
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
I think the employer should be given the
 
00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:54.839 align:start position:0%
free will to make that decision on their
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
own to move forward or not and if they
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
are an outstanding candidate and and
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
they want to move forward with that then
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I failed to mention that I had a
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
about an hour long conversation with a
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
union organizer that I know and uh you
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
know he was bringing up a lot of a lot
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
of the same stuff that we've been
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
talking here but
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know he kind of concurred that this
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
is a this is a can of worms that needs
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
to be worked on and uh you know it could
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of problems for unions can
 
00:58:27.970 --> 00:58:27.980 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of problems for employers
 
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
workers comp companies just regular
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
liability insurance companies uh you
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
know this this is uh this is this says
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
tentacles you know far reach and
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
tentacles I guess you could say and um
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
you know we've uh
 
00:58:44.089 --> 00:58:44.099 align:start position:0%
we've got to tighten this thing up
 
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
before before we presented as something
 
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
is that it yeah motion to adjourn
 
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
anybody I would just see Mr Juve are you
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
