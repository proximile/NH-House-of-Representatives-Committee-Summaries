sorry okay um
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
just going to pull up a PowerPoint um
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.589 align:start position:0%
 
can

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
okay and you could tell me if you can
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
see that on your screen over
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
there and uh I presume that comports
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
more or less with your mission
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully when I uh I've I've you know
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
in putting this together I've thought
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
about the mission and uh I've tried to
 
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
put a
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
presentation that comports with the
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
mission of the committee
 
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
um uh within the context of Co
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinations as that is the um the area
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
of expertise that I was asked to testify
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
about um so I'll give you a little bit
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
of background about myself um I um I
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
work at a law firm that has 60 folks
 
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
about 40 of them do pretty much
 
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
exclusively vaccine work so our firm I
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
believe has the largest vaccine practice
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
in the world that does not represent
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies so we have a uh
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
Department that handles just vaccine
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
injury claims um and you'll hear more
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
about that later we don't bring those
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
claims against pharmaceutical companies
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
we bring them against the federal
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
government um we have a policy practice
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
and exemption practice and and various
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
other intersections of the law and
 
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
other intersections of the law and
vaccines

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
um I um
 
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
I went to Berkeley for law
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
school and uh uh and uh over 20 years
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
later I uh I I find myself doing an area
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
of law that if you told me I'd be doing
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
when I was in law school I probably
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
would have laughed and said is there
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
such a thing called vaccine law what is
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
that but but here I am that's that is
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
what I am doing now it's not what I've
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
always done I clerked for the chief
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
judge at the Supreme Court of Israel
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
after law school for a year and then I
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
worked late milwa Walkins one of the
 
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
biggest firms in the country
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
representing Goldman Sachs lar Ellison
 
00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959 align:start position:0%
for about 6 years after which uh I left
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
uh I was working too much and my wife
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
wanted me home more I don't think that
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
worked out either uh started my own
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
practice um was still doing commercial
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
litigation and eventually um ended up
 
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
doing this work starting about 8 years
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
ago and have been doing it increasingly
 
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
so where that's now pretty much the
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
primary focus of my practice
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
um you might know some of the work we've
 
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
done um you our firm handled for example
 
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.110 align:start position:0%
done um you our firm handled for example
the

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
um the lawsuit against the air force
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
that got a national injunction
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
preventing the Air Force from kicking
 
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
out over 10,000 members of the Air Force
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
who did not want a covid vaccine due to
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
their sincerely held religious beliefs
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
often because of the intersection of
 
00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:23.959 align:start position:0%
that product and
 
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
abortion uh we brought the lawsuit
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
against the FDA when they didn't want to
 
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
release the clinical trial data that
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
they relied upon to license the covid-19
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine um we handle a number of other
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuits all around covid vaccines
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
during the last few years and one of the
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
things I'll say about the lawsuits that
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
we do bring with regards to vaccines is
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
that um since I don't have a PhD after
 
00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
my name or an MD or do uh I don't get to
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
just say things about vaccines I have to
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
prove them with clinical trial data data
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
high impact journals um or they're just
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
not going to work in a cart setting so
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
that um in doing those types of legal
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
work it's
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
really forced us to be I I guess you
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
would say you know real critical
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
evaluators about the products for better
 
00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
or worse and at the end of the day that
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
is something that that I do think the
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
public loses sight of sometimes not
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
always is that these are products um
 
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
like kind of any other products and they
 
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.030 align:start position:0%
like kind of any other products and they
have

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
a safety profile they have an efficacy
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
profile they have things they can do for
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
sure and they have things they can't do
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
um there are things that people think
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
about them that are accurate in some
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
areas and not in others um and sometimes
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
often there's just not information not
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
enough information to reach a conclusion
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
about some things with regards to the
 
00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
products um and so um with that uh sort
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
of brief introduction
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
uh I will uh go through
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
um some of the uh information about
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines and covid vaccines that I think
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be helpful to understand
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
the government including New Hampshire's
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
response during the covid pandemic um
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
Siran glimp that's the name of my firm
 
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the vaccine work that we do
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
is on behalf of I can and you'll see uh
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's a nonprofit and you'll see a lot
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
of the things we discussed today were
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and information gathered in in
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
in lawsuits on behalf of I
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
so to understand covid-19 vaccines in my
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
opinion you have to understand vaccines
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
in general from a legal perspective and
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
how they're treated in this country for
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
decades before if you want to understand
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
how the FDA responded Visa V covid
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines how the CDC how 50 State Health
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
departments how various uh um organs of
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
the state and and and
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
agencies acted regarding covid vaccines
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
they didn't just act tabularasa they
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
didn't just step into a zone that they
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
had no precedent
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
for they stepped into
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
basically in my opinion for the most
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
part uh um business as usual so to speak
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
with how they proceeded Visa covid
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines people look at covid vaccines
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
and say there's something extraordinary
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
I think that um from the from a
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory legal perspective um they
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
weren't that uh uh U unique and and I'll
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
walk you through that and I think that
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that um how vaccines were
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
treated pre covid helps put in context
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
how they were treated during
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
covid now
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to start by focusing on
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
product safety um because I know that's
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
been a uh little bit of a topic of
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
debate around covid
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines and um you know the question I
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
start with is how is product safety
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
assured in
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
America how's this make sure cars are
 
00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
safer every product you see in your
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
house is safer your oven pretty much
 
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
every product you see in this room over
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
time over decades they've gotten safer I
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
mean cars fuel tanks used to blow up
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
right we don't see that anymore and so
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
forth and what drove that product safety
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
the primary thing that drives product
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
safety are Market
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
forces companies exist for the most part
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
to make a profit if they're going to
 
00:13:40.829 --> 00:13:40.839 align:start position:0%
make a product they'll be profitable
 
00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:42.069 align:start position:0%
make a product they'll be profitable
that

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
drives their conduct if there's going to
 
00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
drives their conduct if there's going to
be

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
liability or they anticipate liability
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
beyond what the revenues are they don't
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
make that product they also don't
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
continue selling that
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
product Market forces Drive product
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
safety when you look to use cars as an
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
example and actually in law school they
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
use a lot of car cases as the you know
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
prototype uh cases to teach you know
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
there was this uh you know one of the
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
classic examples there was a car company
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
where um the internal valuation found
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
that it would cost more to fix this
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
component that made gas tanks explode
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
than it would to pay for around the 10
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
people that died every year from those
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
explosions so they didn't fix it it was
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
was a it was a cold hard calculus to be
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
sure I I I hope Corporate America
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't typically act that way but it
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
did in that situation what's that I'm
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
sorry it did in that situation um but I
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
think it's it's reflective of the kind
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
of calculus that happens every day in
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
Corporate America um and to be sure
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's good that's capitalism we want
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
that we want companies to have a
 
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
financial interest to drive Innovation
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's a good
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
thing um and then the push back they get
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
is they know that if they hurt people
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
they can get sued and that often
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
conforms their CCT their conduct before
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
the market the product even gets to
 
00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
Market certainly after it gets to Market
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
but but also before it gets to
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
Market a far weaker way that we assure
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
product safety are Regulators no offense
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
to in government in any way um but you
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
know when you when you do look at take a
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
careful evaluation um and most
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
Industries and you look back at what has
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
conformed their conduct what has driven
 
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
safety uh it's typically been Market
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
forces when you think about um most
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
products you think about class actions
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
you read in the newspapers about oh this
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
product has an issue you don't hear
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
about that typically from a government
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
warning you typically hear about it from
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
The New York Times or the CNN reporting
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
on OIC having this or that issue and so
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
forth and then even more so product
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
liability and class actions attorneys
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
will make sure you see an ad about that
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
injury online because they want you as a
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
client you can't avoid them if you use
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
that product um no knock on
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
lawyers so
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to Market Force
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
assuring product safety I think
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
understanding how um Market forces work
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
with other vaccines will help put
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
how covid-19 vaccines were
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
treated in the early 1980s there were
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
only three routine vaccines that's it
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
there's dtp MMR and
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
opv that's the sum total of all of the
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
routine vaccines in the United States of
 
00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:48.309 align:start position:0%
routine vaccines in the United States of
America

00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
America
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
and the damages they were having to pay
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
and the liability they were incurring
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
from the injuries for those products
 
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.870 align:start position:0%
from the injuries for those products
resulted

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
resulted
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
in either the manufacturers going out of
 
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959 align:start position:0%
business for those three products or
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
stopping to make the products to the
 
00:17:09.789 --> 00:17:09.799 align:start position:0%
point where it reached a crescendo where
 
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
there was one manufacturer left for each
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
of those three
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
products um you can see I've got a quote
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
there from Bruce szv W that's a US
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
that explained that the remaining
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of dtp vaccine estimated
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
that its potential Tor liability exceed
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
its annual sales by a factor of
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
200 and The Institute of medicine
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
explained how by 1986 litigation costs
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
had driven
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers essentially out of
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
business from making those products well
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
Congress in its wisdom instead of
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
forcing those
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to do what every other
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
product manufacturer has to
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
do when their product causes more harm
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
than it does good is measured by dollars
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
and that For Better or Worse How We Do
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
It in
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
America um decided instead to pass the
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
1986 and what this law provided was that
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's okay for the companies that made
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
those products continue selling them
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to worry about liability
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
exposure it's provided in the act it
 
00:18:30.029 --> 00:18:30.039 align:start position:0%
immunized them from finan fincial
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
liability for the injuries caused by
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
those three products this way they
 
00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:36.750 align:start position:0%
those three products this way they
didn't

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
face the financial
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
exposure representative
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
chair in your expertise in research is
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
there any other industry that you know
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
of that gets a blanket
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
liability like this any
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
yes so when it comes to products um and
 
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
I'll distinguish between products and
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
certain services but when it comes to
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
products the only other product I'm not
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
aware of any product none that enjoys
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
the level of
 
00:19:18.669 --> 00:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
immunity to having to pay for injuries
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
that vaccines enjoy and it um it applies
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
to Childhood vaccines and any childhood
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines used by adults so pretty much
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
all vaccines now when it comes to guns
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
for example which has talked about what
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
guns have immunity the immunity that
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
guns have is if the gun is used in the
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
commission of a crime the manufacturer
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
has immunity to liability for the most
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
part but you can still as a consumer if
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
I buy a gun and has a a design defect I
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
can sue the manufacturer of a gun for
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
defectively designing a gun I can sue
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
them for other types of claims but when
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
it comes to vaccines
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
and it's right there in Bruce SZ V Wyatt
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
again the US Supreme Court affirmed
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
because it was challenged that the law
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't actually provide this it says
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and vaccine act preempts all
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
designed defect claims against vaccine
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers for injury or death caused
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
by vaccine side
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
effects design defect claims are the
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
primary way we assure safety it's the
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
way that for example the car I example I
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
described earlier the uh uh there was a
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
say a better way to make that gas tank
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
there was a safer way to make it and the
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
primary claim there was a design defect
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
claim I mean that when you think about
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
saws that now have shields on them
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
that's because the lawsuit said hey whoa
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
you you sold me the saw it does what
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to do thank you right but
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
if You' had put like a three Penny
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
plastic piece on it I still have my arm
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
right there are uh when there are ready
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
ways to improve a product you can sue
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
for a design defect claim but you can
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
never do that for a vaccine forever
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
meaning the state of the those productss
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
in 1986 is essentially locked in at
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
least from the perspective of being able
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
to bring a
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
claim to on the basis that you could
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
have made it safer um so the answer your
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
question is no I'm not aware of any
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
other product that has the immunity
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by vaccines
 
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.990 align:start position:0%
enjoyed by vaccines
none

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
followup so that of course that's for
 
00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
the United States of America are you
 
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
familiar with so are other countries
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
able to go after because of course um
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
you know fiser madna all these other
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
companies uh have products that went you
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
know to other countries as well are they
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
able to um to go after these
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um so if you're asking me
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
specifically about covid-19 vaccines we
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
have copies of the contract procurement
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
contracts from many of the countries
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
around the world and those contracts
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly provided in almost in all the
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
ones we've seen and that's and it's a
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
lot of countries just like the
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
procurement contract United States and
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
actually it's one of my slides later it
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
um provides that the comp the country
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
will either give immunity or indemnify
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
essentially hold the company harmless
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
for injuries caused by the covid
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines used in their countries
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
contractually but I think your question
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
might have been broader in the first
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
instance which is do other countries for
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
other vaccines have um a immunity and
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
many of them do have the similar scheme
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
that that we have here in the United
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
States it's been very very effective and
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's been exported to lots
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
of places in the
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
world um separately you know class
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
actions and the type of
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
um justice system that we have here is
 
00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:42.919 align:start position:0%
not the same in other countries so you
 
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
can't bring the type of claims you can
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
in other countries as you could here um
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
or as effectively but many of them also
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
do have that kind of um liability Shield
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
as well um um yes do you have so based
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
implementation prior to the National
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine injury Act of
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
1986 you had the previous slide that
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
said that the tort would exceed their
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
annual sales by a factor of 200 do we
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
have any idea of the injuries that were
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
happening the
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
numbers um before this was
 
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.630 align:start position:0%
numbers um before this was
implemented

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the dtp vaccine in particular I could
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
tell you has been withdrawn from the
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
United States so that's no longer here
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
since 2000 essentially they it's not
 
00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:36.909 align:start position:0%
since 2000 essentially they it's not
used

00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
and um even I guess you could call it
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
the the regulatory Health establishment
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
decided that the benefits that the risks
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
out way the benefits at least Visa
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
favoring a cellular protest dap DT
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
little AP vaccine so that did change
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
over time um the uh the level of harm
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
caused cused by That vaccine there's no
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's no debate that it causes harm
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
that it causes harm yeah the level
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
debate that you can uh uh that is a sign
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
to that is something that that was
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
debated um and different studies were
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
done um there were studies done by
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
federal health authorities who were
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
promoting mandating pushing mandates of
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
the product and there were some
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
independent studies done and I can tell
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
you they reached different results um
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
and you know but I I'll leave that for a
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
scientist to come and debate which one
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
designed uh but I can't tell you that at
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
least for That vaccine it's the
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
wholesale protest vaccine is no longer
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
used in the United States and I I have a
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
slide or two about that later as well so
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
I'll hold on on the rest of my comment
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
on that if I
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
may um well that brings us to covid-19
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines so I just wanted to make sure
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
you have a back sh of what the 1986 Act
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
was and so the 1986 act applies to covid
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines as
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
well um the immunity under the uh 1986
 
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.310 align:start position:0%
well um the immunity under the uh 1986
act

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
arguably applies when um it is added to
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
the routine childhood schedule by the
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
CDC and specifically as at the advisory
 
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
committee on imization practices which
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
is the cdc's advisory vaccine committee
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh when it's added the
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh essentially the the immunity
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
attaches I qualify that only because
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're also supposed to be an exed tax
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
passed by Congress for covid vaccines
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
which hasn't happened yet but that's um
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
a separate question as it stands right
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
now um I think many would argue that the
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
86 act Community does apply to covid
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines but it is a somewhat of a of of
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
a theoretical question because
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine is afforded a separate
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
level of immunity and that is something
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
called a prep act immunity um and that
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
is a um it's the you know public
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
Readiness and emergency preparedness act
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
that is a law different law passed by
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
Congress which provided that um if the
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
secretary of the Department of Health
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
and Human Services declares that there
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
is an emergency and obviously there are
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
different emergency declarations the
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
president can make one different FDA can
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
make emergency youth authorizations
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
those are different this is under the uh
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
the relevant us code under that under
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
that act the Secretary of HHS can
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
declare an emergency and with based on a
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
perceived or potential pandemic a
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic or other threats and declare
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
that any counter measures developed to
 
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.190 align:start position:0%
that any counter measures developed to
address

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
that um that uh uh what it declared is a
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
threat will be afforded basically
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
blanket immunity for the most part for
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
any claims on the safety side as well as
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
the efficacy side as well as the
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
advertising side which is what the
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
statute provides and at the very very
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
beginning of the covid-19 pandemic the
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
secretary of the Department of Health
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
and Human Services declared covid-19 a
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
emergency and declar that any counter
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
measures developed in response to
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 would be afforded that IM
 
00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
community and that was done right at the
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
very beginning I've got the US code
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
provision there 42 USC 247 d6d and it
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
says manufacturers of any vaccine used
 
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:41.799 align:start position:0%
to treat prevent or mitigate covid-19
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
shall have liability immunity including
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
from suit and liability under federal
 
00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:47.559 align:start position:0%
and state law with respect to all claims
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
for loss caused by arising out of or
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
relating to or resulting
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
from the administration to or the use of
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
an individual of a and then I covid-19
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine but it's broader than that it's
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
also drugs it's masks it's anything that
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
was used
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
okay so you have basically a product
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
that's being developed in with what I
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
would consider a moral hazard the
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer stands to make billions of
 
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
dollars but as they're developing it
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
before they've even started they're
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
really just sted making it they already
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
know that when they design it when they
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
manufacture it when they trial it when
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
they push it out they don't have to
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
worry about being sued for injuries
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
their products
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
causes that that my opinion creates a
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
big moral hazard and it doesn't exist to
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
your point representative with any other
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
market and as I noted earlier not only
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
did the prep act immunity apply the
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of these products wanted
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the prep back immunity
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
would apply in in fact that which is why
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
in their statements of work at least on
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
the US side procurement contracts and so
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
forth they had most of them had a
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
contractual provision similar to this
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
this I believe was the fiser contract
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
one of the the initial I believe fiser
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
procurement contract and it says the
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
government may not use or authorize the
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
use of any product or material provided
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
under this agreement which were covid-19
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines unless such use occurs in the
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
United States and is protected from
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
liability under a declaration issued
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
under the prep Act or successor covid-19
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
prep P Declaration of equal greater
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
scope it literally the United States
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
government guaranteed that nobody would
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
use the products that they were
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
procuring unless prep act immunity
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
applied and um uh uh and the government
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
was one buying all the covid-19 vaccines
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
so they were the uh point of origin for
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
all covid-19 vaccines United States as
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
far as I'm aware operation warp speed
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
took over the whole procurement function
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
and um purchased the vaccines that were
 
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
then distributed in the United States
 
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.070 align:start position:0%
then distributed in the United States
okay

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
so with that backdrop about um immunity
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know and I think that's an very
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
important point to consider when you're
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
thinking about laws regulations around
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
these products obviously you know I
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
think the reason there's so much debate
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
around vaccines is because the main
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
difference between a vaccine and a drug
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
or a medical product or food or water or
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
anything else is that is a legal issue
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
legal distinction it's because people
 
00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
try to mandate them try to force them on
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
others many states have um using School
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines as a as a
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
proxy uh many states have philosophical
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
exemptions parents can just opt out at
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
will and even in those States most
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
School vaccination rates are very
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
high mandates are not NE which which are
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know proof in the pudding that you
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't need mandates to persuade people
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
often but there are a segment of
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
population who often and we could tell
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
you that from our clients every day
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
vaccines either they or they watch their
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
children get
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
injured and they don't want to continue
 
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
participating the problem often comes
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
that for those folks sometimes depending
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
on the vaccine depending on where they
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
are depending they may not be able to go
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
to school get a job and during the co
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic we saw potentially participate
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
in all forms of civil society and
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
obviously that that's a problem for for
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
some folks not for for the others but
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
for some and um you know the whole idea
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
of Rights is is about
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
protecting a minority right we don't
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
need rights to protect majorities
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
typically because they're the majority
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
they can kind of get the laws they want
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
often have the influence they want not
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
always but they're really about
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
protecting the minority and protecting
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
them from government intrusion right
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
overreach and that's the whole Bill of
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
Rights reform limiting the government's
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
ability to infringe on those I don't
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
think we have to be so scared about
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
stomping out the speech of what 90% of
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
Americans want to say it's it's what the
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
10% want to say that we need to protect
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
right often because 90% will get their
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
way all right um so what is the impact
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
of giving Immunity on liability well
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
again I think um it's instructive to
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
look at how clinical trials were
 
00:32:24.269 --> 00:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
conducted before covid-19 for other
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines to then understand how clinical
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
trials were conducted for covid-19
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines because there's a lot of debate
 
00:32:32.629 --> 00:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
around those trials and I think putting
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
them with in the framework of what's
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
done with other vaccines will help
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
understand what it is the FDA was doing
 
00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
at the time um so you know why are
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
clinical trials critical um I think
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's an important question to to
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
understand the answer
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
to to determine whether something is a a
 
00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:53.799 align:start position:0%
a alleged injury is
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
causally not correlation causally
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
related to a product you typically need
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
typically need a
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
prospective study that compares and
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
Expos and an unexposed group okay
 
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
looking at data
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
retrospectively backwards
 
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.230 align:start position:0%
retrospectively backwards
epidemiological

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiological
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
studies are always viewed as being
 
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
unable to determine causation okay so
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
when you uh with that and you can bring
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
an epidemiologist to say that which
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
they'll readily all say um and we
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
litigate that issue all day in vaccine
 
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.870 align:start position:0%
litigate that issue all day in vaccine
Court

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
Court
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh uh the only time you really do a
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
prospective a forward-looking study with
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines is in a clinical trial meaning
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
you it's forward-looking and that you
 
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.149 align:start position:0%
you it's forward-looking and that you
enroll

00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
enroll
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
people you give one group The vaccine
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
you give one group you don't give the
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine and then you follow them and you
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
statistically compare the outcomes
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
between the two groups okay by doing
 
00:33:56.909 --> 00:33:56.919 align:start position:0%
that you have the ideas to remove bias
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
the ideas to then see what does the
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
outcome look like the moment you instead
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
say we're going to take an existing data
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
set and we're now going to try to
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate that set for what happened
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
meaning looking based on the data what
 
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
happened in the past there's always
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
confounders and those confounders are
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
viewed as as tainting those studies and
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
hence you can't determine causation from
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
them well did you did you select people
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
that were too old they were to Young to
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
this I mean you saw these debates happen
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
I think they spilled over into
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream meting which was interesting
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
to watch it's interesting to watch the
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
discussions about clinical trials in
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
mainstream media so um so clinical
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
trials are
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
critical because it is the only time you
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
can do a placebo control prospective
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
study of vaccines pretty
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
much once they've been
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
licensed it is considered
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
unethical to do a placebo controlled
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
clinical trial for a vaccine
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
it's considered une ethical to do a
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
study you need to get something called
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
IRB approval okay where you get an
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
Ethics board to approve it universities
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth IRB committees all around
 
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.589 align:start position:0%
and so forth IRB committees all around
the

00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
country I'm not aware of a single IRB
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
Committee in this whole country that
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
will approve a placebo control clinical
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
trial of a vaccine after it's licensed
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
after it's liced so if you want to
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
really understand the safety profile of
 
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine and you want to be able to know
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
what injuries it actually caused is not
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
what it's alleged to cause but actually
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
causes you need a really good robust
 
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
causes you need a really good robust
clinical

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
trial and I can tell you clinical trial
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
dat is at our firm when we get a parent
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
call us up and say well my child got a
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
hepb vaccine and now suffers from this
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
type of neuropathy or doodia or whatever
 
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.230 align:start position:0%
type of neuropathy or doodia or whatever
it

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
is ideally we'd love to just go to the
 
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
clinical trial data and see well what
 
00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:53.079 align:start position:0%
did it that show between the exposed and
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
unexposed okay uh so representative
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair apologies uh
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
for interrupting I just wanted to
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit because I want I
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
want the cause of this to be very clear
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
for anybody who's here and watching is
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
it correct that the reason it would be
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
considered unethical to do this
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
controlled study after licensing because
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
the license brings with it a presumption
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
of efficacy which would then cause the
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
withholding of that medication from the
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
placebo part of the trial uh is that
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
where the unethical part comes in yeah
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
once they're licensed they're deemed um
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
effective for the indication on the
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
package insert and that indication for
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
example if it says to prevent fusus
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
disease um it is now considered
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
unethical to withhold a product from a
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
child that has an indication that can
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
withhold protest that it can prevent
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
pressus disease right it's because of
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
the efficacy component even if you so
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's why you can't do it
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
um and and clinical trials for for most
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines really focus on the efficacy
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
components of it I mean that's how
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
they're typically
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
designed um they're they're not um and
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
and we I I don't want to make conclusory
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
statements I'll let you judge for
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
yourself let me just I'll show you what
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
the data shows um and you can make your
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
own um conclusions on that um and so why
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
is liability critical to how clinical
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
trials are conducted liability from the
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer is critical because if the
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer knows they're going to be
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
liable for the injuries that you know
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
the V that the product they're making is
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
going to cause if it's a drug for
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
example they want to
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
know the safety profile before that
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
product goes in the market because they
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
could be facing company ending liability
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
if it ends up hurting to many people I
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
me the whole reason drugs and vaccines
 
00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
are licensed because they can hurt some
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
people that's the idea right that's why
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
you have to get them licensed but they
 
00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it doesn't hurt too
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
many people right in terms of the risk
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis that's what often at
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
least the FDA would tell you safe and
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
effective means and so if you take away
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
that liability though from the
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturer they don't have that
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
incentive it has a direct impact in how
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
they conduct clinical trials and we can
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
see that in
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
practice so on the on your screen you
 
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.470 align:start position:0%
practice so on the on your screen you
can

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
see um this is from money in.com I I
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
don't know how reliable that is but I'm
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to assume it's reliable they this
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
is what they say are the five most uh
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
top selling drugs of all time from fizer
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
these are fizer's top most preo 19 okay
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
um and so according to money Inc these
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
are the ones that that made fiser the
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
most money well let's look through this
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
list um on this list you could see four
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
of the products have a little bit of a
 
00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
different clinical trial that was relied
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
upon to license this product when um in
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
the First Column you could see is the
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
name of the drug in the second is the
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
safety review period This is how long
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events were looked at after
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
administration of the drug in the
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
clinical trial relied upon to license
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
that product you could see the very last
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh footnote in the in this is the FDA
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
website. goov you can go to the FDA
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
website and you can open up the package
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
insert for every one of these and in
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
section 6.1 as required by federal
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
regulations it summarizes the clinical
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
trial relied upon to license each of
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
these products so you could see those
 
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
numbers for yourself you do not need to
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
take my word or this uh pinkish chart
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
word for it um it's right there all on
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the FDA website and you could see that
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
for most of these um it was a multi-year
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
period of review after looking for
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events and that they
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
compared the group getting embro with a
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
group getting a placebo elquist for
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
seven years with a placebo and so forth
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
and it's also they're also blinded so
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial investigators they
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't know who's getting the placebo
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
who's getting the drug they follow them
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
for that period of time and then they
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
eventually unblind it and they compare
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
statistically the differential between
 
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
those two groups they do it
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
statistically because you don't want to
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
introduce bias the manufacturer is the
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
one who does the trial and so this way
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
you don't even you're not really sure
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
what the drug will have effect on human
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
beings and so this way by by doing it
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
this way you could see based on a
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
baseline of placebo what does the safety
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
profile look like how does it impact the
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular system how does it impact
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
your nervous system how does it impact
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
your digestive system go down the list
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
of every organ system in your body and
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
they do that cancer rates and so
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
forth when it comes to
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines the design of these clinical
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
trials are not as robust pcv13 that
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
prear 13 is given to babies at 2 four6
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
months of life and then another shot
 
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.990 align:start position:0%
months of life and then another shot
later

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
um that's the only vaccine on this list
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
and you can see the safety rep period
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
was half a year and the control used was
 
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.270 align:start position:0%
was half a year and the control used was
the

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
pcv7 which was the prior version of
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
prear 13 which is probably okay if prear
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
7 had been licensed based in a placebo
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
control trial which we'll take a look at
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
in a minute but the thing is a half a
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
year is actually pretty long for a
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
safety repaired in a vaccine clinical
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
trial these are the uh safety review
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
periods and the control used to license
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
the vaccines given in the first six
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
months of Life each of these
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines are given three times each in
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
the first six months of life and I can
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
assure you that if those numbers look
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
incredible to you that there was only
 
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
five days of safety review for the
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
hepatitis B vaccine given to a newborn
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
baby uh it is incredible and I didn't if
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
you told me that without showing me the
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
proof I wouldn't believe it either and
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
I'll show you the proof because if I was
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make make something up about
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines I wouldn't made that up because
 
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound credible or believable
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
but um I I'll show you that right now in
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
a second but before I do that I just
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
want to highlight the difference between
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
how drugs the clinical trial used to
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
license drugs versus the clinical trial
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
relied upon to license most
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines in terms of three features how
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
long um the safety review is at meaning
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
how long do they monitor for a after the
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
injection what did they compare it
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
against and how well powerered it was
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
meaning how many people were in the
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
trial those are three features of what
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
make a good clinical
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
trial so
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um let's take a look at the first one he
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
be and I'll just show this to you
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
directly because
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
um let's just uh I'm going to just go on
 
00:42:48.319 --> 00:42:49.349 align:start position:0%
um let's just uh I'm going to just go on
the

00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
internet um so everybody can do this
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
themselves too can you see my screen
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
there so we're going to go to FDA
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
license vaccines okay we're going to go
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
to the FDA
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
website and these are all the licensed
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the United States so anybody
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
wants to go and see what was relied upon
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
to license any vaccine license it's
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
right on this page for the most part
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
Excuse me yes um the only thing we see
 
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
is google.com unfortunately oh sorry
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
um it's not uh going to the
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
browser let me see if I escape the
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
presentation oh I know I'm sorry sorry
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
this can you see a browser
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
now okay can you see Google Now Okay the
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
source of all truth here we go uh
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
sorry uh so we go to FDA licensed
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines right here um so you can just
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
search for FDA licensed vaccines here is
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
the FDA website right here you could see
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
at the title it says vaccines license
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
for use United States
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
this page has all the vaccines licensed
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
in the United States by the FDA if you
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
scroll down what you will see is there
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
are four Hepatitis B vaccines listed um
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
two of these are only two of them are
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
licensed for newborn babies or Comax HB
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
and andrix spe the other two are just
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
for adults so we'll click on the first
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
one Rec Comax
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
HB then you can go to the package insert
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
now you know whenever you get a drug
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's a little piece of paper inside
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
the pack Inside the Box well if you open
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
up that paper um as long as it's not an
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
older drug that has hasn't been updated
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
most of them have been it will have a
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
table of contents like the one you see
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
on your screen right now and if you look
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
at this table of contents you will see
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
section 6.1 has a clinical trial
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
experience Federal Regulations require
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
that the manufacturer summarize what was
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial allowed upon to
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
license the product so the manufacturer
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
prepares this document the FDA approves
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
this document so we'll go down to
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
section 6.1 for recova
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
HB and when you go down to section 6.1
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
you will see this is the entire summary
 
00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
this section right here other than the
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
issues that they did note during the
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trial it's just listed 6.2 is
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
the postmarketing
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
experience and this paragraph describes
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial loton a licens this
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine for
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
children I've highlighted it and I'll
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
read it
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
now it says in three clinical studies
 
00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:25.839 align:start position:0%
434 doses of a Comax HB 5 micrograms
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
were administered to 47 healthy infants
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
and children up to 10 years of age who
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
were monitored for 5 days after each
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
dose now the first time I read that too
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
I thought well there must be more why
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
would the FDA license this product for
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
injection to babies with five days of
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring because um you know most
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
autoimmune issues take weeks minimum to
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
rise I mean you know we we deal with
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
vaccin all the time so just like it
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
takes for example immunity the vaccines
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
can provide against disease it takes
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
weeks for those antigens to BU
 
00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
antibodies to build up self antibodies
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
antibodies that might attack self those
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
take at least weeks and then many immune
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
disregulation like asthma take you know
 
00:46:15.069 --> 00:46:15.079 align:start position:0%
chally not diagnosed till a few years
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
old developmental issues you name it
 
00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
most health issues are not going to be
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in a newborn within 5 days if
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's caused by the product it can take
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
months take years that's why for example
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
on all the other drugs we looked at they
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
review safety for years against the
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
placebo so here on the other hand what
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
are we looking at in terms of how well
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
powered it is it's only got 147 children
 
00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
that's not statistic that does not
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
provide enough power to detect virtually
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
anything even if it were there's no
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
control group and then separately the
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring is only five days we foed the
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
FDA and so we've been doing this before
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
covid we foed the FDA for the actual
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
documentation just like we did for covid
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine that the manufacturer submitted
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
presuming that in the documentation you
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
would find safety monitoring review
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events assessment that went on
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
beyond the five days and it's five days
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
of safety monitoring that's what it is
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
um and and again you don't need to take
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
my word for it I have um let me go back
 
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
to the slideshow I will you can pull up
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
the um I've got links on every slide in
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
this presentation I have links typically
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
to government or other similar sources
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
where you could see so um you could see
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
over there I've got the first link is to
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
the actual package inser we just looked
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
at the second link is to the clinical
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
trial report that is on the ican website
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
because we got the Via Foy request but
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
obviously if you click on that what you
 
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:45.559 align:start position:0%
will see is the first page is that it's
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
from the FDA and then you will see the
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
actual clinical trial reports and you
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
can go into thousand something Pages if
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
if you if you're inclined you can look
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
through them yourself and see exactly
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
what was sub submitted because remember
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
the FDA doesn't conduct clinical trials
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you guys know that already the
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
FDA just reviews the data submitted by
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer to assess whether to
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
the level that to the FDA standard of
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
safe and effective it meets that
 
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
standard that's what it's doing
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
please um this was a hard one for me uh
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
my daughter is uh vaccine injured from
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
the hepe so um and I didn't know this
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
level so there was no Placebo at all in
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
in in any study she's 17 now so do you
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
know when this you know study was done
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
was this when they first were rolling it
 
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
out I believe the uh yeah I believe the
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
the first Rec com back HP I believe was
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
licensed in ' 89 I believe nxp was
 
00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
licensed in 91 those would be the only
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
two Standalone hey vaccines given to
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
followup and I know that this is kind of
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
going into what you're going to talk
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
about in regards with um with covid yes
 
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.950 align:start position:0%
about in regards with um with covid yes
um

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
so were there have you seen just in time
 
00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
from what it used to be of course prior
 
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.630 align:start position:0%
from what it used to be of course prior
to

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
1986 um a level of um speeding things up
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
in a sense of whether there's no
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
clinical trials or very minimal in time
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
frame as as we get close closer to um
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
here we are you know in in Co speeding
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
things up in terms of I'm sorry with
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
rolling things out whether it be you
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
know vaccines and other types of drugs
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
that does it seem like things have gone
 
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
faster uh um so since things have gone
 
00:49:49.109 --> 00:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
faster since
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
1986 but I don't I mean if you look at
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
the vaccine schedule since 86 it's just
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
been a straightup trajectory in fact in
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
the 90s many 90s and 2000s many of the
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines currently on the childhood
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
schedule came about but for the covid
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine which I think if you're asking
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
me about that I don't see the covid
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine as rushed in the same way that
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
the public from my
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
perspective as being rushed in the same
 
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:15.880 align:start position:0%
way that it's been um in in the news all
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
vaccines um vaccines have different
 
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
technology I mean people use the term
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
vaccines as a general term but for
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
example this vaccine is a Rec com is a
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
recombinant technology it's recombinant
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
DNA so this he type of hepati B vaccine
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
um uses a very different technology for
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
example than a measles vaccine which is
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
an attenuated vaccine or tetanus or
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
deria which is a toxoid vaccine they all
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
have very sorry very different
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
Technologies and often those
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
Technologies took very decades to
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
develop so they were working on Rec
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
combinant DNA technology for a very long
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
time before they finally came out with
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
this ATB vaccine when it comes to the
 
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
MRNA if you're focused at least on the
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
fiser and the Mna products obviously J&amp;J
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
astroica others had more traditional
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
platforms but the MRNA platform had been
 
00:51:04.829 --> 00:51:04.839 align:start position:0%
in development for decades right I mean
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
it took the science that underpins the
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
creation of mRNA technology has um has
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
they've been working on that for a very
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
long time I mean first they were try to
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
figure out well how do we keep the RNA
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
from not falling apart because the body
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
immediately attacks it so they they took
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
out the urine right and they replace it
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
with with a synthetic iDine as one of
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
the amino acids in it and so the body
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't recognize it and then they're
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
like well that's still not good enough
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
we need to get it into the cell so they
 
00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799 align:start position:0%
you know positive negative when they're
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
when they're in contact on the cell
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
membrane they'll they'll let things in
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
and so they have the lmps the ban
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
particles with a different charge that
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
they put the uh um the the the synthetic
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
piece of mRNA and so forth that didn't
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
happen and that didn't like covid-19
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
didn't come around and they boom they
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
came up with all that Tech and there's
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
ton of other Tech related to that that
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
was decades of development the um Barney
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
Graham at niad the national insute of
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
allergy infectious disease he runs the
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine Development Division there
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's fou Institute barard gr's been
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
working on a um mRNA vaccine for the
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
First Co for for SAR COV 1 for a long
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
time along with madna before covid SAR
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
suv2 came around before current covid
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
virus came around and so um in many ways
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
they they just kind of took the once
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
they had the sequence they kind of
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's why they were able to create it
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
so fast they they pretty much have
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
developed it so uh I mean from my
 
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
perspective it uh no not it's not that
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
different I mean and the clinical trials
 
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
also for the covid vaccines I mean if
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
you're looking at clinical trials I mean
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
compared to any other vaccine they were
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
pretty robust in my opinion if I'm going
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
to take a vaccine based on how robust
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial is I'm taking a covid
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
vaccine every day based on the clinical
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
trial meaning how long was safety
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed covid vaccines was often six
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
for many of them six months how many
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
people were in the trial how well
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
powered they had all 30 to 40,000 people
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
and whether what was the control they
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
did have a placebo control fiser madna
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
they just vaccinated them after an
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
average duration of two months once it
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
was emergency authorized so um I don't
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
know if that that's my perspective on it
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
I I I think see I don't know there's um
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of media Outlets that might
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
disagree with my view on that
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
followup based upon some of the research
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
that I've done uh in regards with just
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
the technology the MRNA technology um
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of information
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
showing you know what happened with
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
animals and um and so I I you know we
 
00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
yes that it had been studied and worked
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
on and researched for a long time but it
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready for prime time just because
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
of you know many of the animals died in
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
those you know ferrets and and whatnot
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
in in studies where created a
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
hyperimmune response and then um yeah
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean you know um just to make
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not talking about Mercury at
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Marisol right now that's been pretty
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
much removed from vaccines in 2000 but
 
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.430 align:start position:0%
much removed from vaccines in 2000 but
aluminum

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
aluminum
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
adant which is aluminum hydroxide
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's a few different kinds those are
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
used to to create for example the help
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
create immune response if I just inject
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
you with a bunch of dead protein snippet
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
your body will probably just gobble it
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
up and get rid of it so if I just took
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know a portion of the prosus
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
bacteria um which is you know basically
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's all amino acid chains right
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
peptides proteins and I it's dead it's
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
not replicating it's not taking over
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
your cells and you just inject it into
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
you it's going to have uh a minimal
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
immune response because your macrofagos
 
00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
your dendritic cells will gobble them up
 
00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
get rid of them um so you need to create
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
an an immune response and and how does
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
the body know that there's danger to
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
have an immune response you need
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
cellular death okay viruses infect cells
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
they take them over they take over the
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
machinery and they replicate themselves
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
and the immune system then attacks them
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
bacteria cause cellular death and when
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
you do that
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
debris it causes your you know uh the
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
inflammation that you see which is
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
basically the blood flowing in nutrifil
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
come pouring out of your blood into that
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
area you cre inflammation you have an
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
immune response um and if it's sustained
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
long enough your body goes oh this is
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
bad it will start grabbing some of the
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
pieces there and take them to your lymph
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
nose looking for the correlate antigen
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
to then create immunity right which we
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
think of as adaptive immunity right
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
versus the immunity that happens just at
 
00:55:41.069 --> 00:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
at the site so um i' say all that to say
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
aluminum aivant which are still used in
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
U many
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines as the primary ingredient one
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
of the primary as an active ingredient
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
to create an immune response because
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
aluminum adant cause cellular death
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
that's why an aluminum can can Preserve
 
00:55:59.230 --> 00:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
stuff for forever it kills everything
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's not human beings have never been
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
exposed to aluminum all of human history
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're locked up with silica in
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
the ground uh we are you know it's only
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
in very very modern history for the
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
first time human beings have ever been
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
we have a use for iron in the body we
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
have a use for magnesium our bodies use
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
all types of different kinds of metals
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
there's no biological use of aluminum in
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
the body none that we're aware
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
of so um but yet that's in vaccines and
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to induce um
 
00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:32.599 align:start position:0%
autoimmunity to something in a lab
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
animal you know what you inject them
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
with Lun managements you pair it with
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
what you want to create the the the the
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know the sensitivity to you and
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
there are you know lots of studies out
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
there so yeah you can find studies that
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
show components of vaccines can cause
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
harm out there and and I don't you know
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it's Unique to covid
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines per se I think a main
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
differential a covid vaccine if I may is
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
that you know with lots of these like
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
you with he be vaccines are given to a
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
tiny cohort of children every year very
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
small per and and healthcare workers uh
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
a very very small percentage of folks in
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
America get that product every year so
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
it takes you know uh uh decades before
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
you really get broad coverage um on the
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
and so if there are going to be issues
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
with that product well you're not going
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
to know from the clinical trial
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um and if it does happen
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
within the population it's going to
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
happen at a slow accumulated rate where
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
it could potentially bleed into the
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
background rate covid vaccine it was
 
00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
given to almost 300 million Americans
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
very very rapidly so the issues that
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
that product did have um you know just
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
focusing on the ones that are not you
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
know Health authorities are willing to
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
agree are causally related like Martis
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
pericarditis um thrombosis thrombopenia
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth um were hard did not
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
BL bleed into the background it's
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
possible for example covid vaccines had
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
slowly been you know introduced in one
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
court at a time and myocarditis among
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
children had slowly increased over two
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
decades U the the ideology of that
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
increase may have not ever been
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
attributed to covid-19
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines um so U but that's speculation
 
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:17.720 align:start position:0%
just to be sure what I just
 
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.549 align:start position:0%
just to be sure what I just
said

00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay um so U this is a deposition just a
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
little clip of a deposition I took and
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
and of the world's Premier
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
vaccinologists so Dr Stanley plin he's
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
the developer of the rubella vaccine
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
he's worked done numerous other vaccines
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
you can go down the list um and
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
literally the medical textbook on
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
vaccines is called plins vaccines which
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
you could see that to the left and this
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
is my exchange with him with regards to
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
precisely the hepatitis B vaccine Rec
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
combo vac HB we just looked at and I
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
think that that exchange helps bring
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
home the importance of a clinical trial
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
um so we'll we'll do this we'll look at
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
this this is just a few minutes we'll
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
look at maybe two other vaccines super
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
quick and then we'll move on to covid
 
00:59:05.549 --> 00:59:05.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine clinical trials I just want to
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
make sure I set the table in terms of
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
clinical trials how the FDA looks at Co
 
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:12.160 align:start position:0%
v u trials and so forth to help put the
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine trials in
 
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.430 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine trials in

in section
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%

potis
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's what it states and
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
that multiple
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:16.430 align:start position:0%
 
sey

01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.750 align:start position:0%
 
these

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
after in order to establish whether it's
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
between the vaccine and condition you
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
randomized and given that thex now
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
appears on the CDC reced list isn't true
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
that it would now be considered
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
yes so I think that that you know that
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
highlights put in this way it's it's
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
always good to read and see kind of so
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
to speak both sides of it but there you
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
have it directly from the world's
 
01:04:17.359 --> 01:04:18.230 align:start position:0%
have it directly from the world's
leading

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
leading
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinologists terms of the importance
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
of clinical trials how you show cation
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
um and the issues with having clinical
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
trial that short I didn't even talk
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
about the fact it was underpowered in
 
01:04:29.589 --> 01:04:29.599 align:start position:0%
that in that
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
clip take super quick look at two more
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
and then let's turn to Clin uh covid
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
vaccines fizer's PCV 13 this prevenar 13
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine um this is the one we looked at
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
earlier remember on that chart of five
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
purportedly fizer's five bestselling
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
drugs um and so um here it is on the CDC
 
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.990 align:start position:0%
drugs um and so um here it is on the CDC
childood

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
childood
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
schedule now
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
um when you look at at the very top
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's from the package insert of prear
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
13 all right there is actually a newer
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
version I reached and came out prevenar
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
20 but prevenar 13 um is still available
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
and when they did the clinical trial for
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
prevenar 13 they did six months of
 
01:05:13.839 --> 01:05:15.829 align:start position:0%
prevenar 13 they did six months of
safety

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
review still not long enough in my
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
estimation for a baby but at least
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
certainly for the work that we do we'
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
like far longer safety review
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
against a proper control but 6 months
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
nonetheless and in that clinical trial
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
you could see in the very top it says
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
serious Adverse Events reported
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
following vaccination and infants and
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
todders occurred in
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
88.2% among pror 13 recipients and 7.2%
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
among prear that's prear 7 recipients
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
Now understand a serious adverse event
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
means something very very serious on the
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
F for the FDA it's
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
I uh let me see it's worth just stopping
 
01:05:59.549 --> 01:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
for a second and opening up the FDA
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
website and looking at what that
 
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:06.710 align:start position:0%
website and looking at what that
definition

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
means um here we go what is a serious
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
adverse event is a technical term used
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
by the FDA um typically for clinical
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
trials it means death life-threatening
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
hospitalization disability or permanent
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
damage congenital anomaly birth defect
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
requireed intervention to prevent
 
01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
permanent impairment or damage or other
 
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
serious it usually requires one of the
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
other conditions above along with with
 
01:06:32.829 --> 01:06:32.839 align:start position:0%
another feature so when you look at
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
serious Adverse Events serious Adverse
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
Events means something very serious and
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
um these are typically you only enroll
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
children who are healthy in these
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trials so you have healthy
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
infants and toddlers who within 6 months
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
8.2% of them have a serious adverse
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
event um if uh a .2% of all infants and
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
todders had a serious adverse event
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
every six months that would be pretty
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
bad in this country um but that said um
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's deemed safe by the FDA because the
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
comparator group and that's how you you
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
do safety and clinical trials you
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
compare the experimental group that
 
01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
getting the experimental product along
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
with the control group um and in this
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
instance they receive the standard of
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
care which is considered appropriate um
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
prear 7 and it could have have been
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate absolutely if prear 7 had
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
been licensed based on a placebo control
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
trial itself that was properly powered
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
and so forth so you knew the safety
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
profile provar 7 that in my opinion that
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
would have been a valid comparator but
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at what the clinical
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
trial was relied upon to licens prear
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
7 in the chart right below that um you
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
can see this is an excerpt from the
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
clinical trial for prevenar 7 that
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
clinical Tri reviewed safety for 30
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
days and the control group received and
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
you can see right there I highlighted in
 
01:08:02.319 --> 01:08:03.150 align:start position:0%
you can see right there I highlighted in
the

01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
footnote right you can see it says
 
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
control dose one you can see prear 7
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
control prear 7 control right and then
 
01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
it's got a little like a um cross looks
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
like and if you go down it defines what
 
01:08:21.789 --> 01:08:21.799 align:start position:0%
the control is and the control is an
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
investigational meaning not licensed
 
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.990 align:start position:0%

experimental investigational Menin
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
cockle Group C conjugate vaccine mncc
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
this product was never
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
licensed so in the clinical trial to
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
license perar 7 and if you want to know
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
why they did this you got to talk to the
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
FDA but they did facts are just there in
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
black and white they licensed prevenar
 
01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
7 based on a clinical trial that
 
01:08:50.679 --> 01:08:53.149 align:start position:0%
7 based on a clinical trial that
compared

01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
it to another experimental vaccine
 
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
again if you told me this I wouldn't
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
believe you in the street but I I'm this
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
is on the FDA site you could see the
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
links right there at the top of each of
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
them you can go look at these yourself
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
and you can also pull out the
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
underlying documentation from the
 
01:09:14.239 --> 01:09:16.309 align:start position:0%
underlying documentation from the
manufacturer

01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
um it's interesting because too because
 
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
when you know when we are doing uh we
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
got a lot of injury cases from this
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
product and when we do them and you look
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
at the uh uh you know to PubMed and you
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
look at the postmarketing license U
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
literature the fact that this was not
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
really studied before it was licensed
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
properly is actually ubiquitous in the
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
literature itself um but in any
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
event so um that's prar 13 and then
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
we'll look at last one is daap you know
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
this is um this one was compared against
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
dtp so again to highlight the importance
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
of what the control group receives
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
because otherwise so what so you know
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
you get one group got 7% adverse event
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
one's 8% you say well that's similar so
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
it's safe might be safe by FDA standards
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
but I don't know how safe it would be
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of a typical
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
parent question please yes
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um just uh for
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
clarification because I'm taking notes
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
so with the prear uh the PCB 13 you said
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
serious Adverse Events was 8.2 and in
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
the um prevenar 7 control what was the
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
rate uh uh yes it's on the screen 7.2%
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
among the prar seven recipients it's the
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
top uh slide oh you can't see it I'm so
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
sorry we'll get we'll get these later
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
right uh yes and this you'll get the
 
01:10:41.189 --> 01:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
whole slideshow later and this is on the
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
FDA uh website do you want me to go to
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
the FDA website I've I've been pulling
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
it up thank you okay I just wanted to
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
get it in my notes thank you sure no
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
problem okay and then you've got dtp V
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
dap that's the one that um was disced a
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
bit earlier wholesale protus vaccine
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
which is stopped being used in the
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
United States um and uh and actually
 
01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
there's no developed country that uses
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
dtp anymore it's only used in developing
 
01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
countries around the world and
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
interestingly it's uh and the current
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
daap vaccine using the United States you
 
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
might say well that's
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
better it's better in terms of safety
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
profile and dtp from um the data that's
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
for sure but the dtp yes sorry
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
so um I'm trying to
 
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.189 align:start position:0%
so um I'm trying to
understand

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
understood that the tort
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
liability for
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
dtp was times 200 and it was causing
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
adverse effects yes but then in this
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes right and um that's
 
01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:57.870 align:start position:0%
yes right and um that's
uh

01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes and and and maybe more troubling is
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that um one of the one of the
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
renowned um clinics in uh in Guinea BAU
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
it's they're from they're Danish um who
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
experts in vaccines and so forth Peter
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
AB he world renown uh until he published
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
this study in a series of studies like
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
this then he was not so world not
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
anymore EXC represent
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
po thank you Madame chair and uh thank
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
you for your presentation help me
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
understand this question about large
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts potential thought against
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines is it unique for this product
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
because we know that many other medical
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
products have side effects and sometimes
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
it takes time like we know that aspirine
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
can have some severe side effects we
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
know that many people take stattin and
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
there are some new research that statins
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
might be not so effective and have some
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
side effects so what is it about
 
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines that manufacturers were uh
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
feeling threatened by that amount of
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
potential t uh against
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines they were causing
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
injuries so um the worst the injury the
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
more damages you get and the damages um
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the injuries were were severe so um
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
U you know at that time two of those
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
three products are no longer with us opv
 
01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.470 align:start position:0%
three products are no longer with us opv
and

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
dtp though the D and the T part are
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
still part of
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
dap um I mean maybe I could answer your
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
question a little bit of a different way
 
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
and say look there's um there are a lot
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
of drugs that are made all the time and
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of times those drugs are made for
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
very small populations they're not meant
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
for millions of people every year in a
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed Market where it's mandated
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
right often um and yet pharmaceutical
 
01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
companies find a way to make profit from
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
those even when they're given to a small
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
group of sick people right so I I you
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
know the argument often made is that
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
well they need to make money well
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
they're making a lot of money on
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines in fact the it's an increasing
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of the portfolio of Merk
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
fiser copi and GSK particular Mna is a
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
newer player um so um U excuse me but
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
also yes it means interrup if if you
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
didn't finished we have another question
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
oh yeah sure uh so I you know obviously
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's in the hearts and
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
minds of the Congress when they passed
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
the 1986 act though I can say that in
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
the 70s there was the swine flu vaccine
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
debac you may recall that and it caused
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
GBS and other issues and CDC you know
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
denied it then admitted part of it and
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
so um the manufacturers were afforded
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
immunity remember back then cuz they um
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
and and that worked out well for them
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
and so you know from an industry
 
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
perspective the 86 Act made sense again
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know you guys know this legislative
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
bodies are complex lots of people lots
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
of Interest lots of moving pieces uh I'd
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
rather litigate all day long than than
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
than to hang out in uh the halls of what
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
you folks do I give you guys a lot of
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
credit to get along and it's wonderful
 
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
um but um uh yeah I mean I think that
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
that I think that could have been instru
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
Ive and certainly helped Drive the
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
industry also the parents at that time
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
who had vaccine or children actually
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
also were um helped
 
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
drive drive the the adoption of the ACT
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
but when its initial iteration didn't
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
include immunity liability its initial
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
iteration was intended for compensating
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
injured children in something called the
 
01:15:49.470 --> 01:15:49.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury Compensation Program the
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh the liability protection was added at
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
the last second so you know um it was it
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
was a debated point but you know there
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
was a there was a Confluence of
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
interests of different people who wanted
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
different things and you ended up with
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
what you ended up please I'm sorry
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
representative Penza thank you madam
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
chair um my research on DPT and I I just
 
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to um if you are familiar and I'm
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
sure you are um wasn't wasn't we were
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like forced into it there were
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't there decades that went by where
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
other countries had dropped that and we
 
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.270 align:start position:0%
other countries had dropped that and we
were

01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
still yeah so Japan was the first to in
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
the 70s um to switch off of wholesale
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
pusis and um other countries as you
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
noted um dropped it um by the 90s I
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
don't think there was virtually any
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
developed country that was using I think
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
we were probably one of the last ones I
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
would want to verify that um but um I
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
would have known this at one point
 
01:16:52.830 --> 01:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
because we had a long exchange with
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
UNICEF about this precise product
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
because all the studies um
 
01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
show there's a dozen studies that show
 
01:17:02.669 --> 01:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
that actually kids you get dtp versus
 
01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
not have increased overall mortality
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's less deaths from tetanus less
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
deaths from pusis and less deaths from
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
deia but all C mortality amongst those
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
who get dtp versus not in this
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
particular study you could see right
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
here in Guinea that was done by Peter AB
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
you had 10 times the number of kids 10
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
times kids who died who got TP
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
only versus um kids who got nothing so
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
um this has actually been a big
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
controversy at the who um and UNICEF
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
because UNICEF is the main procur and
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
distributor of dtp vaccine worldwide
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
it's the most common widely used vaccine
 
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
in the world um the in in in I don't
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
want to get too far astray from covid
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines but in 200 The Who convened a
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
they have bunch of advisory vaccine
 
01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
committees and they convened a committee
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
to actually specifically look at what
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
they call the non-specific effects of
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines death
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
beyond all cause death would be
 
01:18:07.470 --> 01:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
considered a non-specific effect meaning
 
01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's having effect that's not intended
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
by the product and the question was you
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
know do does does this vaccine increase
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
or reduce mortality the uh wh report
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
from 2016 I
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
believe found about 15 studies I think
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
around 12 of them showed an increase
 
01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
risk three showed I believe a decreased
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
risk and they found it inconclusive now
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
all those studies mind you are all and
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
this goes back to what we were talking
 
01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
about earlier they're all retrospective
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies as they must be
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
they're not prospective they're not
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
clinical trials so proven causation it's
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
very difficult right even though this
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
study right that it's on your screen
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
found at 10 times risk even that from an
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
epidemiological perspective cannot prove
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
causation because it's looking at it
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
histo typically historically I mean
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes a body of evidence is just
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and they'll look at case
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
reports they'll put in all kinds of
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
other things that they look at or and
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
especially when they can find a
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism of action so with all of that
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
said the conclusion that the who reached
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
at the time was they said
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
well there's three
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
problems with all of these studies
 
01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
number one they were introduced along
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
with opv vaccine so we don't know what
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
the effect effect of opv is versus dtp
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
one number two they were introduced in
 
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
an environment where deot tennis and
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
prosus were not common anymore what
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
would the numbers look like if you did
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
the study when there was no vaccine
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
around right meaning when the vaccine
 
01:19:44.189 --> 01:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
was first introduced because that is you
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
have a different background population
 
01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.390 align:start position:0%
have a different background population
and

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:52.629 --> 01:19:52.639 align:start position:0%
disease um and those are the two uh and
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
the third issue they took was they said
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
it's not randomized sufficiently okay so
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh these folks AB again you can look
 
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
them up you can look up Peter AB
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
Christine Ben they are uh I mean they'll
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
tell you measles vaccine is the best
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
thing since sliced bread right they'll
 
01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
tell you that um attenuated vaccines
 
01:20:17.189 --> 01:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
have uh uh the opposite effect right um
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
they're they're incredible that means
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
they they're no uh they're in any event
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
the the important point is this they did
 
01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
this study to address exactly those
 
01:20:27.199 --> 01:20:28.030 align:start position:0%
this study to address exactly those
three

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
issues one they looked at it without opv
 
01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
as you can see on this chart two they
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
looked at the data from when dtp was
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
first introduced into Guinea basau to
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
get rid of the background rate issue and
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
the way it was introduced was is that
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
they vaccinated kids based on Bas
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
essentially birthdays which is
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
considered a valid form of randomization
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
so they said hey look who UNICEF we
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
addressed your three issues uh so we we
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
actually our firm had a long exchange
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
with the wh excuse me with UNICEF about
 
01:21:02.629 --> 01:21:02.639 align:start position:0%
this we said here it is this is the best
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
data you're ever going to get unless you
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
do a clinical trial which you're never
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to do this is it you're never
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
getting better data than this uh UNICEF
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
engaged in an exchange and then decided
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
that there they um they didn't have a
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
respon there is no there is no better
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
data we demanded it over and over they
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't provide it we actually
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
petitioned the uh um the
 
01:21:28.030 --> 01:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
ICC um which has jurisdiction over
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
UNICEF uh but they declined to
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
investigate further anyways that's a
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's a digression but yes dtp
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
DPT was used as the control for daap and
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
so this shows you I do all that to show
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
you know this was all the exchanges we
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
had with the government I I do all that
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
to show you the I just want to highlight
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
the U wow that was lucky
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
take lucky take lucky over good any day
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
um uh the the three real features the
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
important features of a clinical trial
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
which are how long the safety was
 
01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:11.590 align:start position:0%
reviewed what was the control and um
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:12.790 align:start position:0%
reviewed what was the control and um
[Music]

01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh the duration of excuse me
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
and how powered it is how many people
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
participated and I show you what that
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
looks like in the world of vaccines
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
versus drugs and I think think that
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
could help put into context how the FDA
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
then approached covid vaccines drugs are
 
01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
licensed in the there's a drug division
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
at the FDA and then there's a biologics
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
division and the biologics division is
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
just separate and the biologics is
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
primarily vaccines there are other
 
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
biologics Beyond V biological products
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
um but um um that is for them those type
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
of Trials are pretty typical if uh I
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'll throw this out there too if anybody
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
wants to see any all the specific
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
specifics for each of the can you see
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
the chart on your screen yeah um this is
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
the you can go to this chart and this
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
chart has for those who are interested
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
every single current vaccine and it's
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
got a link to the FDA website to the
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
clinical trial data that was relied upon
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
to lient as well as a summary chart you
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
can see what the control was you can see
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
how long the safety review period was
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
after injection and you could see the
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
sources all back to the FDA or in some
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
instances the sources are back to the I
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
can website because it was done via Foya
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
we foyer for most of these underlying
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
documents to see and you can and a
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
little note there that kind of gives
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
some context for some of them to
 
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
understand what was it because um the
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
current product if they're testing
 
01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
against a prior product then you want to
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
know okay well that prior product what
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
was that tested against and obviously
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's good that that's important to
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
know okay covid-19 vaccines so uh here
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
we are um for the fer madna there were
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
about 20 15 to 20,000 folks in each in
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
the experimental group versus the
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
placebo group we mentioned this earlier
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
already on average there was a placebo
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
control group on average it was for two
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
months um meaning once it was emergency
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
youth authorized they vaccinated pretty
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
much the entire placebo group um
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
Des despite the FDA actually kind of
 
01:24:18.669 --> 01:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
pushing them car compies not to do it to
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the fda's credit frankly um but they
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
did it anyway um they send letters out
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
to all them essentially saying hey you
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
can come and get this more or less and
 
01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
when I say an average of two months just
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
make sure what that means is some had
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
been in the trial for four months some
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
had been in for one month but on average
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
the placebo control group had been in
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
for around two months okay so there were
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
some that were more than two
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
months okay um and obviously that's in
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
contrast to the other vaccines so from
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
the fda's perspective despite the public
 
01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
saying these clinical trials are not
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
robust enough they don't meet to
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
historical standards these CL trials are
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly robust based on historical
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
standards certainly from the FDA perspec
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
certainly from the perspective of Dr
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
Peter marks who runs the biologic
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
division the vaccine division the FDA I
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
think he thinks these trials were
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
incredible from his perspective and when
 
01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know beyond what they typically had
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
done historically certainly from
 
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:17.800 align:start position:0%
virtually all the childhood vaccines um
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
ju just a quick question on that now you
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the FDA pushed back and
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
asked them to keep the placebo group is
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
that my understanding yes the the FDA
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
preferred expressed a preference and we
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
I we know this we have you know um we do
 
01:25:38.109 --> 01:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of FO requests on the internal
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
Communications they expressed a
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
preference and this was also spilled
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
over into the media too this was not
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
just in the internal documents they
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
expressed the preference that the
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
placebo group uh remain
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
intact um obviously not to the degree
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
where the uh the for government felt
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
they must
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
but they did Express a preference C at
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
least certain corners of them did and as
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
you know there was also an inter you
 
01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
know I familiar with Dr guber and Dr
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
Krauss at the FDA they were the they
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
were the the P the two people directly
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
below Peter marks they quit and you know
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
in the middle of it and anyways um there
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
are committee hearings like this right
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
now where Peter marks and all those
 
01:26:19.709 --> 01:26:19.719 align:start position:0%
folks are being hauled in is my
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
understanding and closed R rooms though
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is is if the
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
FDA could they have insisted or did they
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
have any control over it um and saying
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
even though it is going to be used as an
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
emergency use you still need to keep
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
that placebo group intact so that we can
 
01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:45.719 align:start position:0%
so the procurement contracts had already
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
been signed Pharma companies had already
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
received billions of dollars um the
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
presidents of the United States first
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
Trump then Biden had both widely touted
 
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
promoted these products to the American
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
public assured everybody to get it
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
operation War speed was in full was in
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
full swing um I don't think the Pharma
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
companies were probably very worried
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the FDA was going to pull their
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
authorizations going to speculate that
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go on limb represent Penza
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
um based upon um specifically the the
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
control group and keeping that in a
 
01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
sense pure
 
01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.550 align:start position:0%
sense pure
um

01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't history compared to other I
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't call the covid injections uh
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines I call them experimental gene
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
therapy um I don't like using the word
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine for it but in any case is there
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
history of that happening um does that
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
usually happen in any other um you know
 
01:27:49.270 --> 01:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
in history with other quote unquote
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccines I'm like where
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
we're keeping things separate so we can
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
have data stay in a in a in a pure
 
01:27:59.070 --> 01:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
fashion because after 30 days you're
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
saying they injected the the placebo or
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
the control group well
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
well um they once it was given eua
 
01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:13.719 align:start position:0%
approval the fiser Mna
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
respectively I'll say you could say
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
offered but really I mean when you look
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
at the way they were offering it they
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
were really in my opinion encouraging
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
to um if they
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
wanted they could they could go to fiser
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
or mad and say hey I'd like to be
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
unblinded I'd like to know what where I
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
got the placebo or the vaccine and
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
because for the
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
purposes if they got the placebo to get
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
the shop and so most of them did
 
01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.790 align:start position:0%
the shop and so most of them did
that

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
followup where where where where well
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
here's the thing here's part of the I
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
believe what the f day was was I believe
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
was was saying to him said
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
look we had the Institute of medicine do
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
this this big study of who should get
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
the shots because they're not going to
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
have limited Supply at the beginning so
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
you recall the Institute of medicine
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
which is now known as the National
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
Academy of Medicine uh put out
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
a report and they assess okay uh first
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know there you know those
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
prioritizations between the elderly and
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
healthare workers and so forth you guys
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
remember that back in December 2020 and
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
so different cohorts of Americans
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
depending on their station and what they
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
did were were supposed to get in line so
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
to speak and and and get the shot and so
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments that that was even
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
made I believe at the time to by I think
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
the FDA if not directly at least
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
insinuated this and said look these
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
clinical tribe participants are not in
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
that line they're not they're not the
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
folks who should even be getting it
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
now right December 2020 why don't you at
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
least wait for them to get it in the
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
normal course so when they're when
 
01:29:58.030 --> 01:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're up in the queue and let's say
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
April after the elderly got it the
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
healthare workers got it school teachers
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
got it I don't remember the queue by the
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
way I I might I might get the order
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
wrong I don't remember who got what
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
first um I just I do remember there's a
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
big report on it
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
um so fine so if they're a healthcare
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
worker they should get it when they get
 
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
it but if they're like a healthy
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
22-year-old you know and they're they're
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
not up until July then let them get it
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
in July like everybody else why
 
01:30:28.109 --> 01:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
rush to go and vaccinate the entire
 
01:30:28.119 --> 01:30:30.030 align:start position:0%
rush to go and vaccinate the entire
placebo

01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
placebo
 
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
group why it's a great
 
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
question should ask your whoever you
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
have here testifying to answer that it's
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
a great question I don't have the answer
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
though you should but you should
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
probably bring in uh a pharmaceutical
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
representative from Mna fiser and ask
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
them that question it's a great
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
question I think the answer is pregnant
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
so uh look uh as we talked about
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
earlier and now we'll get into some of
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
the data in the F clinical
 
01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
the data in the F clinical
trial

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
trial
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
um when you do a clinical trial the
 
01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
whole idea is you are evaluating a
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
product that's new you don't know the
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
effects on the human body and hence you
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
want to avoid bias and you do a
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
statistical comparison right it's kind
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
of like the way you design design you do
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
studies often in science you have a
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
study plan and you stick to it you don't
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
change it midc course right uh you don't
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
want to inject bias
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
so what is the most important thing that
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying to prevent with covid-19
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines it was death right that was the
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
idea um to be
 
01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
sure 2019 versus 2020 I think something
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
like an additional 400,000 Americans Di
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
all cause mortality so in 2019 I think
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
there was 2.7 million Americans died or
 
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
something like that in 201 23.2 million
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
died Co presumably killed some of those
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
folks if not many how much of it had to
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
do with changes that we implemented as a
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
society that'll be debated probably
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
forever but what we want to do is avoid
 
01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
injecting that bias and so in the
 
01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.310 align:start position:0%
injecting that bias and so in the
clinical

01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
trial here's a report from fizer
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
in July
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
2021 excuse me and it was in the New
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
England Journal of Medicine and in that
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
report as of July 2021 remember the
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine was authorized in December of
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
2020 so this is now s months later
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
clinical trial data is finally coming
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
out in a publish public form and what it
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
showed was that in the vaccinated grp in
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
the experimental group 15 people died
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
died all cause not covid all
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
cause and 14 died in the placebo group
 
01:33:01.119 --> 01:33:02.030 align:start position:0%
cause and 14 died in the placebo group
all

01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
cause they said I believe two died of Co
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
in the placebo one died of Co in the
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
vaccinated group so the vaccine was I
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
that wasn't considered statistically
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
significant to reduce death so they
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
never claimed it dead and you can look
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the eua and you can look at the lier
 
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
documents they don't claim it reduces
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
deaths because it's not statistically
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
significant finding
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not saying that 15 to 14 is a
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
statistically significant finding either
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not but it it please so
 
01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
is in their clinical trial in July
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
2021 15 people that were vaccinated died
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
and 14 that had the placebo died and it
 
01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
could have been for any reason any
 
01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
reason all cause mortality any any
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
reason whatsoever
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
okay and but of those
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
15 that were vaccinated one actually
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
died of covid and in the placebo group
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
two actually died of covid that's my
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding thank
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
Penza based upon that July 2021 report
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
the placebo was it still truly the
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
placebo it yeah it was the placebo group
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
for the duration that they had placebo
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
group right meaning it was a it was it
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
was at this point really historical data
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
but it but that's when it was published
 
01:34:34.629 --> 01:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
in the New England Journal medicine so
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
and I was you know at that point we were
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
already fighting with the FDA to get all
 
01:34:40.510 --> 01:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
this data and the FDA and the FDA fought
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
us and said no we're not giving it to
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
you we'll give it to you at a pace of
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
500 pages a month which would have taken
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
75 years based on the number of
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
documents they had told us at that point
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
so um so but here's the interesting part
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
about this comparison okay when you
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
drill down and this chart that you see
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
in front of you is a is a a uh
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
shows the cause of death attributed for
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
each one of these people that died so
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
when you drill down into the causes of
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
death what you do find is
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
that those that died from cardiovascular
 
01:35:18.990 --> 01:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
reasons were dying at twice the rate
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much in the vaccinated group so
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know all little Rose in red I don't
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
know if you could see it but um you know
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
basically Cardiac Arrest cardiac failure
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
and so forth you know heart
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
attacks there were two six seven eight
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
nine nine folks in the vaccinated group
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
that died from card cardiovascular
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
issues but in the placea group one two
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
three four five died of cardiovascular
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
issues now that
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
differential in I and again you should
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
you you'd want to have an EP
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
statistician look at that but that
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's quite a differential and there's
 
01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:03.159 align:start position:0%
one group that's did an analysis of that
 
01:36:03.159 --> 01:36:03.950 align:start position:0%
one group that's did an analysis of that
that

01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
does provide that it's significant that
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
but I limited what I was citing here
 
01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
today to only FDA CDC and high impact
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
Journal sources for the most part so
 
01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:15.679 align:start position:0%
that folks everybody can feel
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the data they're
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
looking at thank you representative
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair um I just
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
get a little bit of detail to
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
help paint this picture because we're
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
talking we're talking July of 21 we're
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
talking the height really of of fear and
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
panic yeah over Co were talking at the
 
01:36:44.229 --> 01:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
time where they were issuing an
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
emergency youth use authorization for a
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
drug to treat this pandemic that was a
 
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
lot of fear being struck into people's
 
01:36:54.790 --> 01:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
hearts first can you tell me am I
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
accurate that the total size of this
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
study was was roughly 60,000 is that uh
 
01:37:03.310 --> 01:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
the total size was about 40 43,000
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
people okay 43,000 so about 21 it's you
 
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
could see it at the top there at the end
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
there's about 21,900 in each of these
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
two groups okay and the total length of
 
01:37:15.950 --> 01:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
the study was about how long
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
um so the uh at least the safety review
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
period was six months six months at
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
least at least pursuant to the the study
 
01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.910 align:start position:0%
least at least pursuant to the the study
plan

01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
so to really clarify at the height of
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
the pandemic in a clinical study in
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
which over 40,000 people a pandemic that
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
was striking fear into the people's
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
hearts that this was going to be rampant
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
and and kill tons and tons and tons of
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
people we had a total of 29 deaths
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
occurring out of
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
43,000 over a six-month period in the
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trial yes thank thank
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
you now um represent POS off oh
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
please thank you for taking question
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
just to clarify I understand so
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
21,000 people in the placea group they
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
were observed for six months but they
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
were vaccine free only for first two
 
01:38:18.589 --> 01:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
months on average they were yes that's
 
01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
right they they um when they crossed
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
over so they turned it into a crossover
 
01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:24.510 align:start position:0%
over so they turned it into a crossover
stud

01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
stud
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
first place when they crossed over into
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
the VAC became vaccinated they continued
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
to follow them so um actually within the
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
the folks in the placebo who became
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
unblinded there were five additional
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
deaths in the vaccin group but obviously
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard to compare that to anything
 
01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
because there was no they were the
 
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
placebo group but yes on average two
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
months yeah they continue to observe
 
01:38:54.669 --> 01:38:54.679 align:start position:0%
them um interest interestingly when the
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
FDA apparently crunched the numbers they
 
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
issued a report on this data so what I
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
just showed you here this is what fizer
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
told the public in the New England
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
Journal of Medicine in July 2021 you can
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
read the article yourselves in New
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
England Journal of
 
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
Medicine then you can go and on the
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
bottom left there is the link to the FDA
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
report so this is the FDA summary report
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
with regards to the fiser trial and in
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
the FDA
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
report it said 21 people died in the
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated group and 17 died in the
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
placebo group During the period that
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
they were meaning they they matched them
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
up so that they were looking at them in
 
01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:37.229 align:start position:0%
up so that they were looking at them in
like

01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
durations right meaning it's not the
 
01:39:42.270 --> 01:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated group the 21 deaths were not
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
continuing to look Beyond when the
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
essentially the VAC placeo group was
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so here you are in November
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
of 2021
 
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
and the FDA is finally releasing what
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial data shows and from a
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
statistical comparison which is the way
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
these trials should be
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
done you had 21 according to the FDA
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
deaths in the vaccinated Group 17 in the
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
PBO group all cause mortality if the
 
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of this product was to reduce
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
deaths the trial certainly didn't show
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
that on an all cause mortality
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
basis now what's extremely concern and
 
01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
there's the quote from dose 1 through
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
March 31 2021 date data cut off date
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
right there were a total 38 deaths 21
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
the commodity group and 17 the place
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
group N deaths were considered related
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
to vaccination well who did that who
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
considered them unrelated
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
visor it is under the fda's regulations
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
for conducting clinical trials it is the
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor so the who guidance would
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
actually have left it to the principal
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
investigator of each clinical trial site
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
which would also be paid by foser but in
 
01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
the US the FDA um actually leaves it to
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor themselves to to make a
 
01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:02.109 align:start position:0%
the sponsor themselves to to make a
causality

01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
causality
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
determination here's the interesting
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
part from my perspective for what it's
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
worth when it came to for example
 
01:41:10.270 --> 01:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
determining this vaccine was e
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
efficacious at reducing symptoms right
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
what did they license it based on not
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
reduction of mortality remember if
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
anybody read the eua documentation at
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
the time not reduction in serious harm
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
but on the reduction of of symptoms
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
and they did that by doing a comparison
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
where they said there was about I forgot
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
the number now six seven or eight folks
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
in the vaccine group that had symptoms
 
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
that tested positive with some symptoms
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
and there were about hundred something
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the placebo group who tested positive
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
with symptoms putting aside that there
 
01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
were about 600 other people who were
 
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
never tested who had symptoms and there
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
were a few thousand people with symptoms
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
in the study that they put us and and
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is all done by Peter Doshi at
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
University of Maryland after we got all
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the data from the clinical trial from
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
the FDA you could see that there were
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
thousands of individuals in this trial
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
who should have been tested too and who
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
knows what the outcome would have been
 
01:42:07.589 --> 01:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
but they did a statistical comparison
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
between those numbers and they said 95%
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
effective because you had only had about
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know whatever six or seven in the
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
VAC in the vaccinated with some symptoms
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
that tested positive and about a 100 in
 
01:42:22.350 --> 01:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
the placebo that uh had some symptoms of
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
tested positive
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
they didn't look under the hood there
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
they didn't do a individualized inject
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
your judgment bias into the study to
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
make that comparison they said nope 95%
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
effective but when it came to the deaths
 
01:42:40.589 --> 01:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
the more important number then they let
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
fiser inject its bias and do a death
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
byde assessment of whether it's related
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold despite 21 deaths in
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccinated in 17 the placebo out my
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
numbers fda's numbers it's on their you
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
can look at it
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
yourself they let fiser conclude that
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
none of them are related to
 
01:43:07.229 --> 01:43:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.990 --> 01:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
so when did the FDA know I mean this
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
they're saying that this report was
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
November 2021 and the other one was July
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
of 2021 but when did
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
fizer I mean the FDA actually know what
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers were do we know
 
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
that I don't know the precise state that
 
01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
fizer submitted the data to the FDA or
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
when Marx grber Krauss or their
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
statistical reviewer FB teams finally
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
looked at it and crunched it but
 
01:43:45.070 --> 01:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean this is also just to be sure
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
not uncommon um in the sense that the uh
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
assessment of causality unfortunately it
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be this way and I don't know
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
why it is but is left to the
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor for things like
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
this uh represent
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
leus has any um followup been done as
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
far as who those 100 people were and who
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
those six or seven people were and their
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
characteristics and how they were chosen
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
any of that yeah uh uh yes uh the
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh the British medical journal the bmj
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
considered one of the most prestigious
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
journals in the world um not in a
 
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies in that journal to
 
01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
be sure but in pieces published by at
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
least one of the members of the
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
editorial staff uh Dr Peter Doshi who is
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
a pharmacologist at the University of
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
Maryland he took an interest to his
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
credit in looking at those numbers
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
carefully and what I was saying to you
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
earlier about how when he looks at the
 
01:45:00.589 --> 01:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
data they let let me put it this way we
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
had millions of Americans test all day
 
01:45:05.550 --> 01:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
long every other day right they could
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
have easily just had all 43,000
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
participants tests once a week done
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
easily right then you would know whether
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
the vaccine stop transmission you would
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
know every instance of somebody who had
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
symptoms whether or not they had uh
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
where they were in the VAC whether they
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
had Co or the vaccine unac but they
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
didn't do that they didn't do that they
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
only tested in certain instances in the
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
clinical trial and so that's why you
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
ended up with those small
 
01:45:37.149 --> 01:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
numbers to be sure a lot of like I was
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
saying before there were hundreds of
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
people that had symptomatologies
 
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
consistent potentially with covid in the
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
trial that were not tested that
 
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's just what that's just what
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial documents show uh why
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's another question that you maybe
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
you can ask you know you should bring in
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
Peter Marks here and ask him why would
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
they do that it would have been so easy
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
to just test everybody once a week but
 
01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.310 align:start position:0%
to just test everybody once a week but
representative

01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
po I think what you just brought up in
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
regards with testing is is huge um just
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
to kind of I'd have to go look it up but
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
when um when did the whether it was the
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
CDC or the FDA come out with and and
 
01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
basically pull the PCR test wasn't that
 
01:46:30.109 --> 01:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
in was that December of 22 when they
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
came out I know they came out with a
 
01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
statement several months earlier because
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
um they knew that the tests were not
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
accurate it of course it depended on how
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
the Cycles were um it you know you could
 
01:46:46.149 --> 01:46:46.159 align:start position:0%
test positive for covid even though you
 
01:46:48.669 --> 01:46:48.679 align:start position:0%
might have had Co and you had antibi all
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff so kind of
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that um yeah I I it's a
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's a great question actually I don't
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
know the interplay between the timing of
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
these study these trials and uh when
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
they updated and and um corrected the
 
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
PCR testing um I I don't know it's good
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
question though I don't know followup
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my other
 
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
question is okay so this report came out
 
01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:16.790 align:start position:0%
question is okay so this report came out
November

01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
November
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
2021 and from their quote from dose 1
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
through March 13 2021 so do we know when
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
that dose one was
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
so yes so what was the time frame from
 
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
dose 1 till March 13 2021 and since
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're from answering before you said it
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
was historical are we sure that those
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
that that placebo group was not injected
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
from dose one to March 13
 
01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.709 align:start position:0%
from dose one to March 13
2021

01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
um they
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
they were there were folks in the place
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
group that were injected during that
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
period but this comparison is is is is
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
um doing a comparison basically on a
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
times sensitive basis between the
 
01:48:09.149 --> 01:48:09.159 align:start position:0%
placebo and the vaccinated group it
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
invalid invalid to compare the
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated group for the entire duration
 
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
of the trial against just the placebo
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
group for a limited which because it was
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
a more limited time period so they you
 
01:48:25.950 --> 01:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
you time adjust it to add to end up with
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
basically uh apples to compare to Apples
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
so these are supposed to be comparison
 
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
now also this wasn't to to be sure this
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't retrospective in that the trial
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
itself was prospective and had they just
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
an arate statistical comparison that
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
would be what you're supposed to do in a
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
prospective trial by letting fiser
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
inject its bias it basically converted
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
it into a retrospective study like going
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
back to this chart from July where you
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
could see had nine deaths from
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular issues amongst the 15
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
that died in the vaccinated and five
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
deaths in the placea group from
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular issues like that should
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
have been a statistical comparison that
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
should have been done and it wasn't it's
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
just teased out we teased it out but
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's in there it's sitting right there
 
01:49:14.109 --> 01:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
in the reported data because they just
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
say they just let fiser conclude none of
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
these are related shouldn't have done
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion they should have done
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
is just forced the statistical
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
comparison okay we had nine card
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular deaths in the vaccinated
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
five in the placebo group that's a
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
pretty big differential that's something
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
we should you know uh uh that could be
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
statistically significant or at the
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
least say look whole point here is to
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
reduce mortality and if it's we're
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
having more deaths in the vaccin group
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's an issue maybe we shouldn't let
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
fiser determine causality you know it's
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
not like these F it's not like 10 folks
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the placebo group were in a plane
 
01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:51.030 align:start position:0%
in the placebo group were in a plane
crash

01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
crash
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
okay they were dying of things actually
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
that you could and we now know can be
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
ascribed to the vaccine in some degree
 
01:50:03.629 --> 01:50:03.639 align:start position:0%
right cardiovascular issues for example
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
um we asked the SDA by the way this
 
01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
precise question we said are you not are
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
you is it too small on the screen oh
 
01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay so so I we sent a letter to the FDA
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
and you can there's a link to it we said
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
why are the death data from a randomized
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
control trial treated like a clinical
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
case series like a retrospective study
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
rather than an RCT when it comes to
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
assessing causality right they didn't do
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
that for the other stuff but they did it
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
for death why so the fda's response was
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh we're unable to respond substantively
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
at this time due to Resource constraints
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
and the ongoing pandemic response and
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
now that was years ago we followed up
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
numerous times since then um they they
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
still have no answer to that really
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
important question and of all the
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions you don't have time for they
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
should had an answer to this question on
 
01:51:00.189 --> 01:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
they should have had it like this it's
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
not something you should have to look
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
into but there's still no response to
 
01:51:06.069 --> 01:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
that they complain they also went on in
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
the letter to complain about how much we
 
01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
sue them and and Foy of them but you
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
know uh in any event um uh excuse me
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you madam
 
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
chair and I I want to quickly return to
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
kind of what I was trying to get at
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
before which is we have this study
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
43,000 people over a period of six
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
months at the height of the fear of the
 
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic um we have a grand total of I
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
believe it was 29 um deaths during that
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
period of time of which three were
 
01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
attributed to
 
01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:41.709 align:start position:0%
attributed to
covid

01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:41.719 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
now I understand because you as you
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned there was some perhaps
 
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
somewhat convoluted rationale given for
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
approving the emergency youth author
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
authorization for the drug but I'm
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
actually want to go one step back from
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
that and say in six months 43,000 people
 
01:52:02.430 --> 01:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
being studied three died of covid what
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
was the justification for the emergency
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
place um I mean the just
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'll answer like a lawyer uh the
 
01:52:19.229 --> 01:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
justifications are set out by the
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
president in his Declaration of
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
Emergency the secretary and his secretor
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
HS in his and in the FDA and their uh in
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
their rationale for granting emergencies
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
authorization I mean they're they they
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
do lay them out why they believe these
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
were emergencies at the
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
time represent TZ thank you um thank you
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh you've been laying out a lot of
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
really helpful information so what I'm
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
wondering is a couple things is were
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
there other clinical trials and then by
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
July of 20121 how many people had
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
received a covid vaccine worldwide and
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
what kinds of impacts did we see and
 
01:52:55.950 --> 01:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
then related to the last question what
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
was the sort of um population of
 
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
participants in the clinical trial
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
versus the people who were actually
 
01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
dying from covid um let's focus on the
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
United States because you know we we we
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
already agreed there were people who
 
01:53:13.229 --> 01:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
were more at risk yeah um you know age
 
01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:15.639 align:start position:0%
other things yeah yeah I mean according
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the CDC I believe the average age of
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
somebody dying from covid is pretty
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
close to the average age of people who
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
just die in General on all cause basis
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
um so obviously it it the the average
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
age of death from covid was really high
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
so to answer your last question in terms
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
of what is the demographics of those in
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial versus the
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
demographics of those in the general
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
population um uh the clinical trial.gov
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
would have a copy of the uh should have
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
that information um how much of a
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
onetoone it is I don't know offand but
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
that can be easily uh assessed um I I
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm C I do know that certain
 
01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
high-risk groups are not included in the
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
clinical trial because that creates
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
complications though there were some
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
folks um in terms of your other two
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
questions I think my next slide might
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
two slides might answer that your I
 
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
think might answer your question um and
 
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
that is um if you look over here you
 
01:54:16.589 --> 01:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
know you can debate all day long whether
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
or not somebody died of covid or did
 
01:54:22.589 --> 01:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
they die of covid vaccine or did they
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
die of lockdown or you know you I'm sure
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
you all are familiar with this debate
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
out there there's been a lot of debate
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
about how do you attribute the
 
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
deaths um did we more people die because
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
they now didn't have aners to can Cancer
 
01:54:40.830 --> 01:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
Care did they die because they didn't
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
have access to what have
 
01:54:43.239 --> 01:54:45.109 align:start position:0%
have access to what have
you

01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:54:49.709 --> 01:54:49.719 align:start position:0%
um one number that's hard to debate
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
typically it's typically binary is death
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
either you died or you didn't die and so
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
looking at all cause mortality just
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
meaning all deaths period I think helps
 
01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
provide uh not a perfect way to look at
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
the answerers to your question
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative but um but but I think a
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
window into an answer to your question
 
01:55:16.030 --> 01:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
so in 2019 this is all CDC data and got
 
01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
the link right there it said that preco
 
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
there were 2.85 million deaths deaths
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
registered in the United
 
01:55:26.149 --> 01:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
States in
 
01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
2020 there were 3.38 million deaths so
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
um and and um that's when Co was raging
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
through the country if you watch the
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
news um and presumably those who are
 
01:55:45.550 --> 01:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
most susceptible to covid would have
 
01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
died during that period That's when
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
there was the nursing homes and a lot of
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
folks were were dying who were elderly
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
the first covid
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine was authorized in December of 20
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
December 20th I believe of
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
2020 and pretty much nobody got the shot
 
01:56:07.470 --> 01:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
2021 and so if covid vaccine was going
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
to have a significant reduction in
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
mortality in America you would
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
presumably see it in the all cause
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
mortality number right I mean look you
 
01:56:21.239 --> 01:56:22.910 align:start position:0%
mortality number right I mean look you
did

01:56:22.910 --> 01:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
there were what is that
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
like uh about 500,000 more deaths in
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
2019 2020 it's a lot more deaths right
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
so that's way above
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
Baseline you'd expect a reduction
 
01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
especially because presumably those who
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
are most susceptible to death from covid
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
would have succumbed in 20120 but yet in
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
most of America and to answer your
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
question if you look on the left that's
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
a chart of the daily covid-19 vaccine
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
doses administered so um every it's
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a daily data point I mean
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
at that there was one day alone few
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
months into 2020 where they vaccinated
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
3.5 million Americans this is just the
 
01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:17.870 align:start position:0%
3.5 million Americans this is just the
United

01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
United
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
States so you know in the first few
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
months they vaccinated I don't know the
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
remember exactly but it was a lot of
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
folks um you know going through 2020
 
01:57:29.550 --> 01:57:29.560 align:start position:0%
they basically had fully vaccinated I
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
mean majority of Americans had gotten
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
the sh a super majority of Americans had
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
gotten the
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
shot but yet you did not see all cause
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
mortality go down you in fact saw it go
 
01:57:46.430 --> 01:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
up the CDC registered in 2021 after we
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated the whole country 3.46
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
million deaths
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
and the part that I think should have
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
been alarming to health
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.119 --> 01:58:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
deaths

01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
skewed towards a younger curve so you
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
had more younger folks as compared to
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
2020 dying but even if we put that
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
aside if you want to argue that covid
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
vaccines reduce mortality I think these
 
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
numbers make give make it a harder case
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
to make um and and you know I I use
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
these numbers because I've you know when
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
you look at all the studies out there
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
you've got the clinical trial data that
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
clearly shows far more people died in
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccinated group then what are you
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
left with you're left with again people
 
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
taking historical
 
01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
data and introducing their bias to it
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies and there's lots
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
of them out there and they by the way
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
they cut both ways there's all kinds of
 
01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
studies about mortality and covid
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines some of them
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
um huge cohorts some small cohorts some
 
01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:57.480 align:start position:0%
more robust than others but most of them
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
historical except for a number of
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
countries who were publishing weekly or
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
monthly statistics on mortality
 
01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations cases and transmission
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
like England like Scotland and when the
 
01:59:12.069 --> 01:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
numbers inverted between the vaccine
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated group all those cohorts
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
disappear we have copies of those if the
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee would like them um and they
 
01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
sto publishing those numbers again just
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's just a historical fact so um so
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh the numbers interestingly in my
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
assessment that you see all CA in a
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
population basis in the United States
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
comports actually with the clinical
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
trial data on a statistical level
 
01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:41.030 align:start position:0%
trial data on a statistical level
um

01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:44.189 --> 01:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
and you also if you look at the you
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
might say okay well maybe more people
 
01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
died overall but maybe we had less covid
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
deaths this is also far from uh I
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get on a stand and testify to
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
this under a Darbo standard in federal
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
court but you you can eyeball this chart
 
02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
um you know and you can look at the
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
cumulative confirmed covid deaths
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
according to our world in data okay as
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
reliable that is they they say it's wh
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
covid-19 dashboard so they're sourcing
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
from The Who and they're saying and you
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
can look actually starting when they
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
started the vaccination the death curve
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't flatten in fact if you look at
 
02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:22.550 align:start position:0%
doesn't flatten in fact if you look at
it

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
um uh after you know this the peaking
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
so in any event you can make any
 
02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:31.800 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies show anything
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
you want um the large numbers on the
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
statistical basis I think are are
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
probably more reliable to look at okay
 
02:00:43.229 --> 02:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
and really um you know we I'm not going
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
to say this again but really why bother
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
conducting a clinical trial if the num
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
if when the numbers you when the numbers
 
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
don't show what you want then you do a
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
subjective assessment but when they show
 
02:00:53.790 --> 02:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
what you want you do it
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
statistically doesn't make sense to me
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm going to show you just uh
 
02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to go through a few more
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
little data points here about the trials
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
one is and then we'll wrap up the
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
clinical trial piece of this um so um
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
the fiser clinical trial there was one
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
for for 16 and older that's what we just
 
02:01:18.270 --> 02:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
looked at separately and that's what it
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
was authorized for in December 20 2020
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
for 16 and older separately to get an
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
authorization and lure for 12 to 15 year
 
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
olds there was a separate clinical trial
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay in this clinical trial they
 
02:01:35.750 --> 02:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated a grand total of 1,131 kids
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
Maddie Deary our client is one of those
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
children okay you could see a picture of
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
her in October 20th doing a handstand
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
January 16th this is her doing a Tik Tok
 
02:01:47.239 --> 02:01:58.709 align:start position:0%
January 16th this is her doing a Tik Tok
video

02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.669 --> 02:02:00.679 align:start position:0%
and this is January 20th she goes in for
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
a second fiser dose not as just a person
 
02:02:06.069 --> 02:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
in the public as a clinical trial
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
participant do you know how I know her
 
02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
parents were not uh against
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines she participated in a clinical
 
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
trial forget just get the vaccine right
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do their part they wanted
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
this is Maddie you can see in the video
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
on the left she had within 24 hours she
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
was in an emergency room a Cascade of
 
02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:36.679 align:start position:0%
emergency room visits that eventually
 
02:02:38.350 --> 02:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
resulted in her being in a wheel chair
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
and have a feeding
 
02:02:42.270 --> 02:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
tube she basically has a form of you
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
know neurological disorder which is
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
common type of injury at least when
 
02:02:51.310 --> 02:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
there's a vaccine injury right so a lot
 
02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
of vaccine injuries that we deal with
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
are immune or immun mediated
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
neurological issues like gomber syndrome
 
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
transmis you can go down the list um
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's basically where your immune system
 
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
attacks your nerves um you know in the
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
case of for example GBS starts in your
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
periphery Works your way up you could
 
02:03:12.430 --> 02:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
recover you can get paralyzed we have um
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
all types of GBS cases at our firm that
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
we bring so um now the fact that Maddie
 
02:03:20.589 --> 02:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
was injured by a vaccine
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
is okay drugs injure people it
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
happens the real concern from a
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory perspective is how the FDA
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
dealt with it that is the real
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
travesty not in any way to minimize the
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
pain and and harm to uh to
 
02:03:41.599 --> 02:03:43.270 align:start position:0%
pain and and harm to uh to
Maddie

02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
Maddie
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
so this now that we got all of the
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
documents that fiser submitted to the
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
FDA license it's covid vaccine this is
 
02:03:51.159 --> 02:03:52.390 align:start position:0%
FDA license it's covid vaccine this is
what

02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
this is what the FDA report excuse me
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
fiser reported Maddy's injury to the FD
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
they reported it as functional abdominal
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
pain they did not say she's in a
 
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
wheelchair they did not say she couldn't
 
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
walk they did not say she has a feeding
 
02:04:08.589 --> 02:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
tube they basically said it's in her
 
02:04:14.549 --> 02:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
ache and uh it's it's a uh the reason
 
02:04:21.149 --> 02:04:21.159 align:start position:0%
that it's a siral LLP link not a FDA
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
link by the way way is because we had to
 
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit in southern district of
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
Ohio to get these documents from the
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
FDA what did fiser tell the public about
 
02:04:33.149 --> 02:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
Maddie well here's its published report
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
in May 27 2021 it says there were no
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine related serious a events in a
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
public believe that's uh again the New
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
now we at our firm I mentioned earlier
 
02:04:58.109 --> 02:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
we do vaccine cases we have three
 
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
medical professionals on staff we have
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know lawyers and paralegals and
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
we litigate vaccine injuries all day we
 
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
don't do them against pharmac companies
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
you can't because of the 86 act we do
 
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
them in a little Federal program called
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and Compensation Program
 
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you about that later but we
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
review medical records all day long to
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
assess causality and whether we can
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
prove causality in court if I could
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
bring a case from Maddie in court I
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
could easily prove that no question the
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
fizer's vaccine is the causal reason
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
there's no differential diagnosis
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's no other reason and and there's
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
a biological reason plausible reason for
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
how it was caused and all the records
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
showed uh the that the ideology was from
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
the from the from the vaccine in any
 
02:05:43.790 --> 02:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
event we sent numerous detailed letters
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
with access to all of madd's medical
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
records to the FDA saying hey hey hey
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
hey FDA um uh you know this this is what
 
02:05:55.589 --> 02:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
the FIS telling the public and and
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
here's what fiser told you and I'm we're
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
telling you this is not true this is not
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
true fizer Maddie was seriously injured
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
and you know what even if fizer doesn't
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
think it's from the vaccine the
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements required it
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
provide that information that's the
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
whole idea of a clinical trial you
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
assess you gather all the reactions now
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
you want to then say it's not the
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine fine but you got to report it
 
02:06:26.589 --> 02:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
we said either way even if you conclude
 
02:06:27.950 --> 02:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine didn't cause it which I
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't know how you do that fizer should
 
02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
be in huge trouble huge trouble for not
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
telling you about this not just not
 
02:06:40.229 --> 02:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
telling you misrepresenting to you that
 
02:06:44.669 --> 02:06:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
pain that first link you can read all
 
02:06:50.709 --> 02:06:50.719 align:start position:0%
our letters and they're detailed they're
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
medical I had our medical professionals
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
detailed all of it you know
 
02:06:59.310 --> 02:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
um and we finally got a response in
 
02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
February 26 2022 so months
 
02:07:05.149 --> 02:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
later and you can go and read that
 
02:07:05.159 --> 02:07:06.189 align:start position:0%
later and you can go and read that
response

02:07:06.189 --> 02:07:06.199 align:start position:0%
response
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
yourself the response from the FDA was
 
02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
report I I literally can't make that up
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
you should I encourage everyone to read
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
incredible an onslaught of folks kept
 
02:07:35.149 --> 02:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
contacting the FDA about
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
Maddie and in June of
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
20121 and this is from our lawsuit in
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
the southern district of Ohio we sued
 
02:07:44.910 --> 02:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
the FDA because they wouldn't give us
 
02:07:47.549 --> 02:07:47.559 align:start position:0%
the documents thank God for Foya freedom
 
02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
information act and we finally got all
 
02:07:54.270 --> 02:07:54.280 align:start position:0%
the internal emails within the FDA
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
regarding Maddie de Gary including email
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
Communications where um somebody who's
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
very very very wealthy emails Janet
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock who was then the acting
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
director commissioner of the FDA and so
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
that apparently finally prompts her to
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
then email Dr Peter marks the head of
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
the vaccine division who then emails a
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of other folks and say uh can you
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
guys look into this our letter didn't do
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
it Maddie being on national news didn't
 
02:08:26.990 --> 02:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
do it but apparently this did it I don't
 
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.549 align:start position:0%
do it but apparently this did it I don't
know

02:08:28.549 --> 02:08:28.559 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
why they email fizer and they say fiser
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
what what's up with this situation with
 
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
Maddie fizer emails back a detailed
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
report for the first time explaining all
 
02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
the issues she had okay for the first
 
02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
time if I'm at the FDA my respon
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
response should
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
be what the heck why didn't you tell me
 
02:08:57.950 --> 02:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
this before and what else are you hiding
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
from me but that's not the exchange that
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
link at the bottom I encourage everybody
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
to read you want to see how the FDA
 
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
works you want to see the sausage is
 
02:09:09.629 --> 02:09:09.639 align:start position:0%
made you should read this internal Email
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
exchange about MADD dear when you read
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
this assessment by
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
fizer you would think oh my god there it
 
02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
is fizer's admitting it was the vaccine
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
because that's the way it reads and at
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
the very end it says the pi the
 
02:09:25.119 --> 02:09:27.669 align:start position:0%
the very end it says the pi the
principal

02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
investigator uh who's paid by
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
fer did not feel did not feel the
 
02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:35.709 align:start position:0%
fer did not feel did not feel the
subject's

02:09:35.709 --> 02:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
subject's
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
symptomatology that's how they spelled
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
it was consistent with a vaccine related
 
02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:41.830 align:start position:0%
it was consistent with a vaccine related
adverse

02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
event and that was it that's where the
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
chain ends they email that back up the
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
chain and they just accept that
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion there's nothing in the
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
communication to see that fizer is going
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be investigated fizer is going to be
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
in trouble for this are they going to do
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
another audit of its documents are they
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
going to look further into this are they
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
going to contact mad's family they're
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
going to contact us nothing I'm sorry
 
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
please um what do you mean he did not
 
02:10:08.430 --> 02:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
feel he didn't
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
feel I didn't feel like having coffee
 
02:10:13.629 --> 02:10:13.639 align:start position:0%
this morning I felt like having two he
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that her injuries were
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with the VAC out it isn't
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
incredible it's incredible because
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
remember remember you're you're you're
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
talking about a product that's new the
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
whole point of the clinical trials is to
 
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
see what issues it could cause that are
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
unknown and he says well this doesn't
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
fit with what basically I understand a
 
02:10:38.549 --> 02:10:38.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine to be able to cause so it's not
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine related so just to follow up on
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
that so as an investigator who's paid by
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine isn't it his job to assess and
 
02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.189 align:start position:0%
vaccine isn't it his job to assess and
not

02:10:53.189 --> 02:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
feel that was his
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
chair I you I just kind of wanted you to
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
repeat this because I think it's it's so
 
02:11:12.430 --> 02:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
important for it to be said this is um
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
was authorized under emergency youth
 
02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
authorization it was done in a way that
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
pushed things out before really having
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
enough knowledge I believe
 
02:11:29.189 --> 02:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
and it was it's not doesn't fall under
 
02:11:30.510 --> 02:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
any sort of
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
traditional quote unquote vaccine so
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
you're telling me they based it off of
 
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
let's say for
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
example uh an
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
MMR of adverse effects because it didn't
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
follow some of those things and that's
 
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
what they based upon in a sense I I um
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
well I think you might be giving um Dr
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
Frank too much credit there um I it's
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
his assessment of what he he feels is a
 
02:12:03.149 --> 02:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine related adverse
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
event follow up thank you madam
 
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
chair the documents that came out that
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
fizer was withholding for a period of
 
02:12:15.549 --> 02:12:15.559 align:start position:0%
time that was I believe almost nine
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
pages long of different side effects
 
02:12:21.270 --> 02:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
that you could have was that released at
 
02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:22.229 align:start position:0%
that you could have was that released at
this

02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:22.239 --> 02:12:24.030 align:start position:0%
this
point

02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
um so the it wasn't fiser withholding by
 
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
the way it was the FDA because it was
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
fiser has no obligation to with to
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
produce documents to the public uh the
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
only reason the FDA had to produce those
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the public was because the because of
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
the freedom information act and I don't
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
think our lawsuit had yet received an
 
02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
order to produce the documents at this
 
02:12:46.549 --> 02:12:46.559 align:start position:0%
point and um
 
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
um you're testing I yeah I'm not I'm not
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
sure if that page of potential Adverse
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
Events that boser had listed was public
 
02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
yet thank you I'd have to check
 
02:12:59.549 --> 02:12:59.559 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you madam
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
chair and I apologize for interrupting I
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted to take just a second I have
 
02:13:06.189 --> 02:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
up here a uh website article I wanted to
 
02:13:08.189 --> 02:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
quickly um note in the record
 
02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
statnews.com August 9th 2021 indicating
 
02:13:14.549 --> 02:13:14.559 align:start position:0%
as the FDA was searching for a new
 
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner there was a letterwriting
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
campaign undertaken by uh those who
 
02:13:21.910 --> 02:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
statistically had significant ific um
 
02:13:24.270 --> 02:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
Financial contributions from the uh
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical Industries indicating
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
significant pharmaceutical industry
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
support for uh commissioner Woodcock to
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
be named as head of the FDA thank
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
you yeah I mean I for what it's worth my
 
02:13:40.270 --> 02:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
assessment is actually that um when you
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
look at all the internal emails person
 
02:13:44.189 --> 02:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
really calling the shots in terms of
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
authorizing licing these vaccines at the
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
FDA was Dr Peter Marx not do not not Dr
 
02:13:53.310 --> 02:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
woodcock um to be sure she actually had
 
02:13:54.589 --> 02:13:54.599 align:start position:0%
to sign it at the end of the day I
 
02:13:57.069 --> 02:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
believe um though actually I think it
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
was Dr Peter marks who signed the
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
authorizations my recollection Serv but
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
he was the one really when you look at
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
the internal documents uh my assessment
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
is he's the one who really made that
 
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
decision I mean he's the one who decided
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
really at the end of the day I mean
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
there is the there is verac which is the
 
02:14:16.109 --> 02:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
advisory committee I mean uh within the
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
FDA that
 
02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
advises the FDA about whether or not to
 
02:14:21.629 --> 02:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
license or not license and so so forth
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day it's it's Dr
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
Peter marks who made the decision of
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not there would be a verb
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
back hearing or not and then uh um
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
really what would happen and uh when
 
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
guber and Strauss um for example his two
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
subordinates would not uh uh I think um
 
02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
would not as the internal email show
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
license excuse me authorize and and then
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
license on a timeline that he wanted
 
02:14:49.390 --> 02:14:49.400 align:start position:0%
that really is what led to I believe
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
their uh going out the internal
 
02:14:55.149 --> 02:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
Communications reflect them emailing and
 
02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
taking significant issue with Dr marks
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
trying to move up the licenser timeline
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
because among other reasons he believed
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
that once it was licensed that uh
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
there'd be more mandates and so he
 
02:15:08.189 --> 02:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to accelerate the lure
 
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
process and guber and Strauss pushed
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
back and they ended up on the outside of
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
of the uh on the other side of the FDA
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
front doors um but but going back to
 
02:15:19.790 --> 02:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
Maddie excuse me one moment represent
 
02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:21.510 align:start position:0%
Maddie excuse me one moment represent
Venza

02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
Venza
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
you might get to hear in your
 
02:15:25.549 --> 02:15:25.559 align:start position:0%
presentation I just um and I think it's
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
really important because it's kind of
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
like there were no one's talking about
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
um the J&amp;J the one shot at all which of
 
02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
course fell under emergency youth
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
authorization um our committee had
 
02:15:40.430 --> 02:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
someone here that was vaccine injured
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
her daughter was from that I know
 
02:15:45.669 --> 02:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
several other people here in the state
 
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
um that were uh that were injured from
 
02:15:51.870 --> 02:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
that shot and um we PR Ed that a lot
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
here in in New Hampshire and I just was
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
wondering do you have any information on
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
that specifically because it was like
 
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
here it got pulled it got put back and
 
02:16:03.790 --> 02:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
then now it doesn't even exist anymore
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I focus on the fizer madna
 
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
in particularly fiser because that is
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
what most Americans receive very small
 
02:16:12.189 --> 02:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of Americans receive the J&amp;J
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
shot and then there's the Novac shot
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
which even smaller percentage got and
 
02:16:17.390 --> 02:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
astrazenica was never authorized a
 
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
license here so um yeah I mean J&amp;J use a
 
02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
bit more of a traditional platform but
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
it had similar issues I mean look
 
02:16:27.549 --> 02:16:27.559 align:start position:0%
I again from my perspective I don't
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
really view the the what you call you
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
know the MRNA vaccines is any really
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
different than most of the other
 
02:16:35.549 --> 02:16:35.559 align:start position:0%
vaccines or like the J&amp;J I mean uh to
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
the extent that um you know I mean using
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
DNA technology like I said Rec combinant
 
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
DNA vaccines are used DNA technology I
 
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
mean they take basically snipp of the
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
DNA they take they take it yeast DNA
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
they take out a slice they slice in the
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
the um the the antigens that they want
 
02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:52.990 align:start position:0%
the um the the antigens that they want
to

02:16:52.990 --> 02:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
create and they I mean it's it's kind of
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
a DNA technology too and we've been
 
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
doing that since you know for 30 years
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
so I mean if we're going to
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
differentiate vaccines based on the
 
02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
technology that they used to make them
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
um then it's hard to actually label
 
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of silos for vaccines and
 
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
again my assessment is not that there
 
02:17:16.270 --> 02:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
were Rush the J&amp;J vaccine had also you
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
know had had had different types of
 
02:17:21.070 --> 02:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
issues in particular TTS
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
right um and what made TTS so
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
interesting is that it's it's not normal
 
02:17:30.190 --> 02:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
to have reduced platelet counts right
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
but yet increased clotting so normally
 
02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in with clotting you give
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
them a blood thinner because you you
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
figure they're having too many platelets
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
problem is is that uh people presenting
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
with blood clots they were giving them
 
02:17:46.549 --> 02:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
blood thinners now realizing their
 
02:17:47.790 --> 02:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
platet counts already low and then
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
killing them in a hospital by mistake
 
02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
unintentionally using you know they they
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
thought they were doing the right thing
 
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
and and because it's not a common event
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's not going to hide in a background
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
rate that's stuck out like a sore thumb
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
TTS and that's why it made the news
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
right away was identified and and um
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events that are common in the
 
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
background radar are far harder to to
 
02:18:14.669 --> 02:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
tease out so to speak but on J&amp;J at
 
02:18:16.669 --> 02:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
least TTS was obviously recognized which
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
is why they pulled in then it came
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
back okay um
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
so anyway I think I'm about to wrap up
 
02:18:26.190 --> 02:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
the clinical trial Section almost by the
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
way M de Gary adding insult to injury
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
was censored all over the Internet for
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
just telling her story they all of her
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
posts were you know censored you were
 
02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
throttled you people were kicked off for
 
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
doing it and you might say well why wh
 
02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
why would the FDA do this I can't answer
 
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
completely and I think I've given some
 
02:18:49.389 --> 02:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
Snippets as to it but here is Dr Peter
 
02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
marks this is the man who really decided
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
whether authorize and license coac he's
 
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
the one in that email chain I just told
 
02:18:58.429 --> 02:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
you about with Maddie way way after what
 
02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
after he'd already gone to the American
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
people and told them you should all get
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
this shot before it was even licensed
 
02:19:07.709 --> 02:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
this is Dr marks in a YouTube video this
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
is him I he made this the FDA made this
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
doing just a minute this is the person
 
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
who's supposed to impartially
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
objectively coldly look at this data
 
02:19:18.429 --> 02:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
decide whether millions of Americans
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
should get it and he's out there
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
promoting the
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine that creates an inherent
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
conflict he goes and he tells everybody
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
to get it is he really then going to go
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
oops sorry I messed up he should have
 
02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
been nowhere near promotion of this
 
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
product no place the FDA doesn't go out
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
and promote drugs that's why they don't
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
have as much of an issue to pull those
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
products they say oh yeah obic yep
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
oopsie yeah we messed up we licens it
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
but we didn't know this FDA doesn't go
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
and create advertisements doesn't have
 
02:19:52.429 --> 02:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
this on their homeage page this is the
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
homepage of the FDA this does not look
 
02:19:56.429 --> 02:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
like a regulatory this looks like an
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
advertisement and amazingly it was for
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
the B veiling vaccine it wasn't even a
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
licensed product meaning it hadn't yet
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
been shown to be safe and effective just
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure where we understand each
 
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
other when you eua when you authorize a
 
02:20:12.469 --> 02:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
product emergency use authorization
 
02:20:13.990 --> 02:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
authorize a product it has not yet been
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
shown to be safe and effective pursuing
 
02:20:17.469 --> 02:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
to the FDA
 
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
standards later if it's licensed it's
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
met that FDA standards so this didn't
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
even meet the FDA standards yet and yet
 
02:20:28.990 --> 02:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
here it is being promoted it creates a
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
real serious conflict for the FDA to
 
02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
then say oops
 
02:20:36.270 --> 02:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
sorry um and and separately forget what
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
the FDA itself does it has an advisory
 
02:20:41.710 --> 02:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
committee that advises the FDA and you
 
02:20:43.230 --> 02:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
probably have seen those those were what
 
02:20:45.550 --> 02:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
were all over TV with Paul offit and
 
02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
some of the other you know
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinologists have a whole you know
 
02:20:50.110 --> 02:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary Committee of of of
 
02:20:51.429 --> 02:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
medical profess professionals that sit
 
02:20:54.510 --> 02:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
there um I'm I'm almost done with this
 
02:20:57.309 --> 02:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
clinical trial Section and uh this is a
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
congressional report that looked at the
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
fda's advisory committee and this is
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
what the FD this is what the uh
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
Congressional report concluded the
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of members both
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
voting members and Consultants have
 
02:21:10.750 --> 02:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
substantial ties pharmaceutical
 
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
industry I've deposed a number of these
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinologists and folks who sit on
 
02:21:15.710 --> 02:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
these committies and it is incredible
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
actually the same people who conduct
 
02:21:18.710 --> 02:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
clinical trials are paid by farmer
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
consultants for them are also sitting on
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that you often hear
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
that it's independent I I and and here's
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
this not me that's that's a
 
02:21:29.070 --> 02:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
congressional report reaching that
 
02:21:30.510 --> 02:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
conclusion you could read the report and
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
you could read in detail the incredible
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
amount of conflicts um and then you
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
think they'd clean up their act but
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
here's again this is the HHS Inspector
 
02:21:41.550 --> 02:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
General again finding nine years later
 
02:21:43.710 --> 02:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
the same type of systemic conflicts
 
02:21:45.910 --> 02:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
going on I'll show you this one video
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
and then I'll wrap up the clinical trial
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
Section I'm sure you guys have heard
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
enough from me this morning
 
02:21:56.590 --> 02:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
want to eat something um so this is the
 
02:21:58.110 --> 02:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
U so we talked about the FDA itself and
 
02:21:59.710 --> 02:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
Peter marks we've talked about the
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine Safety Committee uh the advisory
 
02:22:04.750 --> 02:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
committee there is also when a clinical
 
02:22:05.950 --> 02:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
trial is ongoing there's something
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
called a data safety monitoring board an
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
independent data safety monitoring board
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this board is supposed to
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
be objectively an independently review
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
the safety of the product while the
 
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine is undergoing clinical trial
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay Dr uh uh Katherine Edwards she's
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
the third author on plins vaccine editor
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
she is a world renowned vaccinologist
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
she runs the cdc's sisa program which uh
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
evaluates specific vaccine injuries um
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
she's done a uh probably I don't know
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
involved in half of the clinical trials
 
02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
involving childhood vaccines that are on
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
the schedule I could be wrong about that
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
but I think that's what she told me and
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
when I deposed her and um here's a case
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
where she's on the stand and I'm asking
 
02:22:53.830 --> 02:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
her specifically about her role in the
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
data safety monitor board with regards
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine um yes I can try to do that let
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
me see if I turn it up on my machine
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:32.120 --> 02:24:06.429 align:start position:0%
 
ready

02:24:06.429 --> 02:24:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
you're one of the only five members of
 
02:24:08.399 --> 02:24:12.269 align:start position:0%
you're one of the only five members of
that

02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
dat right
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's supposed to be
 
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
independent data
 
02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:27.550 align:start position:0%
independent data
it

02:24:27.550 --> 02:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
is all of us in
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
America are hoping on and ring upon
 
02:24:35.230 --> 02:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
going to independently make sure that
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
beend that members of that independent
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
data safety board are in fact
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
dependent of
 
02:25:14.349 --> 02:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's isn't it true that directly
 
02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
supp question
 
02:25:48.349 --> 02:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
was before you became a member of
 
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.389 align:start position:0%
 
isn't

02:25:55.389 --> 02:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:55.399 --> 02:25:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:25:59.870 --> 02:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
that you were an
 
02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:02.110 align:start position:0%
that you were an
advisor

02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
advisor
 
02:26:05.990 --> 02:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
to yes sir I think what you're consuming
 
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:13.710 align:start position:0%
to yes sir I think what you're consuming
is

02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
that what they want me to say is and has
 
02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
that what they want me to say is and has
never

02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
my I say what I believe on my
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
expertise you don't think that
 
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
Financial incentives
 
02:26:43.550 --> 02:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
not

02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
because mean folks who were never
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:58.510 --> 02:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
she I think she really believ she's
 
02:27:00.910 --> 02:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
independent she does I I have no reason
 
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
to doubt that she sincerely thinks she's
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
independent but you know we all know
 
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
that that bias can creep in right it can
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
corrupt in ways that are conscious and
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
and often
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
unconscious um and so now we've gone
 
02:27:15.870 --> 02:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
through The Regulators the independent
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
board the data safety monitoring board
 
02:27:21.469 --> 02:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
um also the C da we've talked about this
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
fought us forever in court to release
 
02:27:24.990 --> 02:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
the data and that really brings us to
 
02:27:26.670 --> 02:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
the end of clinical trials and I'll stop
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
there and I'll just say this much to be
 
02:27:32.349 --> 02:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
clear to be sure I'm not you know the
 
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
whole reason of showing all this is not
 
02:27:35.309 --> 02:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
to take
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh I genuinely believe anybody who wants
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
a vaccine should be free to get one you
 
02:27:42.670 --> 02:27:42.680 align:start position:0%
know if you want to you know uh stay at
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
home and wear six masks and vaccine
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
every day should be able to that's
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
Freedom that's America should be able to
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
do that but I think that those who want
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
to let's say look at some of this
 
02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
information who understand let's say how
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
clinical trials are done who look at
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
this and want to come to their own
 
02:27:57.950 --> 02:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion should also be free to do
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
that and and and to be sure if anybody's
 
02:28:01.150 --> 02:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
thinking about well don't they stop
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
transmission we'll get to that um at
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
part four and I'll talk about
 
02:28:07.710 --> 02:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
postlicensure safety uh when we get back
 
02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:08.990 align:start position:0%
postlicensure safety uh when we get back
from

02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
from

uh being uh excuse me being 125 I'm
 
03:26:57.870 --> 03:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
going to call this meeting back into
 
03:27:01.070 --> 03:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
order um Aon Siri is our presenter and
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
we are on part three covid-19 vaccines
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh nope this
 
03:27:28.590 --> 03:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
one sorry there we go okay I do a lot of
 
03:27:29.950 --> 03:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
people tell you the they think the red
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay keeps it interesting um okay so we
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
went through the
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
pre-licensure with regards to
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
safety but also some efficacy components
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
as well and now we'll talk about
 
03:27:52.750 --> 03:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
postlicensure because you might say to
 
03:27:57.189 --> 03:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
yourself look um all right so you know
 
03:27:59.309 --> 03:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
maybe the trials weren't great but after
 
03:28:01.990 --> 03:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
license you're definitely studied right
 
03:28:06.070 --> 03:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
and um in order to look at that I want
 
03:28:09.309 --> 03:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
to look at how other vaccines are licens
 
03:28:12.990 --> 03:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me studied after lure and I think
 
03:28:16.229 --> 03:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
that will give you a baseline to a
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
assess and think about how the CDC and
 
03:28:20.349 --> 03:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
the FDA
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
approach post-license or safety now
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
post-license or safety is typically the
 
03:28:26.510 --> 03:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
purview of the CDC so the FDA does the
 
03:28:29.189 --> 03:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
pre-licensure CDC does the postlicensure
 
03:28:32.510 --> 03:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
typically um and ah has some involvement
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
um but usually they just stle out money
 
03:28:36.110 --> 03:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:28:39.229 --> 03:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
um as a proxy
 
03:28:44.269 --> 03:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
basically for assessing how
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
robust is the quote unquote science that
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
studies vaccine safety after lure I'm
 
03:28:53.150 --> 03:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to use the uh the
 
03:28:55.750 --> 03:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
claim that rest assured vaccines do not
 
03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
cause and I bet you guys all already
 
03:29:00.670 --> 03:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
know the word that's in the blank it's
 
03:29:04.469 --> 03:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
autism right vaccines do not C autism I
 
03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
think is a good proxy for how well
 
03:29:07.630 --> 03:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety is really studied after
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
licensure because it is the claim that
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
public health authorities Federal all 50
 
03:29:14.830 --> 03:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
states you name it you talk to the
 
03:29:16.269 --> 03:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
average medical doctor they will tell
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
you that question has been
 
03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
thoroughly studied and absolutely
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
debunked that vaccines do not cause
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
autism and we know it because we have
 
03:29:34.630 --> 03:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
study that issue period and we have the
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
science the studies the data to prove it
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll play a little Montage that this
 
03:29:43.189 --> 03:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
is the hom page this is on the CDC
 
03:29:44.750 --> 03:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
website vaccines do not cause autism
 
03:29:47.710 --> 03:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
there's no qualification
 
03:29:50.110 --> 03:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
scient Community what causes autism but
 
03:29:52.710 --> 03:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
we know that vaccines do not vaccines
 
03:29:54.389 --> 03:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
are really the one thing we have looked
 
03:29:58.030 --> 03:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
at cusing we know that vaccines don't
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
cause autism the science is clear
 
03:30:03.309 --> 03:30:03.319 align:start position:0%
vaccines don't cause autism I do not
 
03:30:05.309 --> 03:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
deny in any way that we need to do more
 
03:30:07.349 --> 03:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
about autism but it has nothing to do
 
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
with vaccines let me be clear vaccines
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
do not cause autism vaccines don't cause
 
03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:16.269 align:start position:0%
do not cause autism vaccines don't cause
autism

03:30:16.269 --> 03:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
autism
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure okay vaccines do not
 
03:30:20.160 --> 03:30:21.189 align:start position:0%
absolutely sure okay vaccines do not
cause

03:30:21.189 --> 03:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
cause
 
03:30:24.429 --> 03:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
autism so I'm going to use that uh I'm
 
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
not here to I'm not trying to debate the
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
question of vaccines cause autism I'm
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
just using that as a proxy to see let's
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
look at what the state of the science is
 
03:30:33.670 --> 03:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
on that question is a proxy for what it
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
looks like for the numerous other health
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
issues that parents will routinely at
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
least call our Fir and will have
 
03:30:42.670 --> 03:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
complained about as vaccines potentially
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
causing now there are a number of PS
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
studies that have surveyed parents with
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
children with autism and asked them what
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
do you think caused your child's autism
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
and despite
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
the almost endless campaign by public
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
authorities to convince the public
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines do not cause autism 40 to 70%
 
03:31:03.030 --> 03:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the study of autism parents
 
03:31:04.670 --> 03:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
still blame vaccines for causing their
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
child's autism and when you ask them
 
03:31:09.269 --> 03:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
what vaccines they
 
03:31:12.030 --> 03:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
blame this all the ones that I just
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
highlighted and read if you could see
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that they will bring
 
03:31:17.229 --> 03:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
up they they will bring up all the shots
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the first 6 months of Life heppe daap
 
03:31:24.189 --> 03:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
Hib pcv13 and ipv each given three times
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
as well as MMR MMR is given no earlier
 
03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
than 12 months okay we know autism can
 
03:31:34.110 --> 03:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
often typically be diagnosed with before
 
03:31:36.790 --> 03:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
one year of age so if you're going to
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
study whether vaccines cause
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
autism and your parents are saying they
 
03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
believe vaccines caused autism you
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
should probably study the vaccines given
 
03:31:47.710 --> 03:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
in the first six months of Life at the
 
03:31:50.630 --> 03:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
least if you're going to claim vaccines
 
03:31:53.110 --> 03:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
do not cause autism you should have
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
studies that show that vaccines don't
 
03:31:55.760 --> 03:31:56.750 align:start position:0%
studies that show that vaccines don't
cause

03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
cause
 
03:31:56.760 --> 03:31:58.429 align:start position:0%
cause
autism

03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
autism
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
well let's see what's in fact been done
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
in that regard and I'm going to go
 
03:32:05.309 --> 03:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
through a quick little timeline here
 
03:32:08.070 --> 03:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
starting with the 1986 act that's the
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
national child vac indri act we talked
 
03:32:11.309 --> 03:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
about that earlier that gave immunity to
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies set up a
 
03:32:15.309 --> 03:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine court and so forth well at the
 
03:32:19.590 --> 03:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
time that it was ped it directed our
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
federal health authorities to study what
 
03:32:24.429 --> 03:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
was then presumably The 11 most common
 
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
claimed injuries from vaccine all the
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
way back in the
 
03:32:32.750 --> 03:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
80s and and one of them was whether or
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
not protus this vaccine causes autism
 
03:32:38.189 --> 03:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll read the language in the
 
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
federal law at the time the Secretary of
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services shall complete
 
03:32:43.990 --> 03:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
a review of all relevant medical and
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
scientific information on the nature
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances and extent of the
 
03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
relationship of any between vaccines
 
03:32:49.880 --> 03:32:51.429 align:start position:0%
relationship of any between vaccines
containing

03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
containing
 
03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
pusis including wholesale and specific
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
antigens meaning whole and uh um attent
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
like the ones we have today and the
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
following illnesses and conditions 1
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
through 11 number nine being autism okay
 
03:33:08.229 --> 03:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
this is a decade before uh Andrew
 
03:33:11.710 --> 03:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
Wakefield this is a decade before MMR
 
03:33:14.590 --> 03:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
controversy this is all the way back in
 
03:33:18.269 --> 03:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.030 --> 03:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
so the uh Federal authorities went and
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
they commissioned the national well the
 
03:33:24.630 --> 03:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh what's then known as The Institute of
 
03:33:26.110 --> 03:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
medicine now the National Academy of
 
03:33:28.750 --> 03:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
medicine and they paid them to conduct a
 
03:33:31.469 --> 03:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
review of all the existing literature
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
with regards to those 11 conditions to
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
see whether or not what does the
 
03:33:38.830 --> 03:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
literature the the peer viwed science
 
03:33:42.349 --> 03:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
actually show and what um uh they found
 
03:33:44.429 --> 03:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
was that for
 
03:33:47.189 --> 03:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
autism there was no evidence bearing a
 
03:33:49.229 --> 03:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
causal relationship meaning they did not
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
find a single study that had studied the
 
03:33:53.229 --> 03:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
question that doesn't mean vaccine's
 
03:33:53.239 --> 03:33:54.429 align:start position:0%
question that doesn't mean vaccine's
cause

03:33:54.429 --> 03:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
cause
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
autism didn't mean protested SE cause
 
03:33:59.150 --> 03:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
autism but it means the question had not
 
03:33:59.160 --> 03:34:00.110 align:start position:0%
autism but it means the question had not
been

03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:34:02.590 --> 03:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
answered no category of evidence was
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
found bearing on a judgment about
 
03:34:06.550 --> 03:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
causation all categories of evidence
 
03:34:10.229 --> 03:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
left blank on table 1-1 so here we are
 
03:34:12.990 --> 03:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
it was they went they looked they looked
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
through all of the studies the science
 
03:34:17.830 --> 03:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
the data and they could not find a shred
 
03:34:19.510 --> 03:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
of evidence to inform the question of
 
03:34:21.030 --> 03:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not protus vaccines cause
 
03:34:23.110 --> 03:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
autism that was
 
03:34:23.120 --> 03:34:25.030 align:start position:0%
autism that was
1991

03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
1991
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.510 --> 03:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
2012 CDC and HR say hrsa Human Health
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
Resources Administration that is another
 
03:34:37.309 --> 03:34:37.319 align:start position:0%
agency within HHS that administers
 
03:34:40.030 --> 03:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
actually vaccine court hrsa and CDC
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
jointly funded a study by The Institute
 
03:34:45.710 --> 03:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
of medicine to look at what they said
 
03:34:48.389 --> 03:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
were the 150 something most commonly
 
03:34:50.429 --> 03:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
claimed injuries from vaccines that's
 
03:34:54.309 --> 03:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
they said not me CDC hrsa and one of the
 
03:34:56.510 --> 03:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
claimed injuries continued to be whether
 
03:34:59.550 --> 03:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
pertusus vaccine caused
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
autism as well as deia and Tennis
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so the Institute of medicine
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
convened a panel of you know
 
03:35:10.630 --> 03:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary panel that looked at
 
03:35:12.590 --> 03:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
all the science out there and they
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
looked at the epidemiological evidence
 
03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
and when you read that section if you if
 
03:35:18.269 --> 03:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
you you know have a moment oh I don't
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
have a link here to the report well I I
 
03:35:23.070 --> 03:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
can provide a link to the full report um
 
03:35:24.990 --> 03:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
and uh the epidemiological evidence they
 
03:35:26.070 --> 03:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
only found one
 
03:35:28.750 --> 03:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
study by guy and Guy it actually showed
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
there was a correlation between DTaP
 
03:35:33.950 --> 03:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine and autism but they uh the threw
 
03:35:35.309 --> 03:35:35.319 align:start position:0%
the study out as unreliable because it
 
03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
was based on V's data so that was
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
discounted they could find no other Epi
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
studies they could find no mechanistic
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
evidence meaning it just wasn't looked
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
at and so their causal ity conclusion
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
again this is the Institute of medicine
 
03:35:51.630 --> 03:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
saying this not me is the evidence is
 
03:35:55.070 --> 03:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate to accept or reject a causal
 
03:35:56.990 --> 03:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
relationship between deia toxoid tetanus
 
03:35:58.750 --> 03:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
toxoid or a cellular protus containing
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines and
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
autism that's not vaccines don't cause
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
autism that's we don't know if vaccines
 
03:36:08.070 --> 03:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
cause autism well let me be let me be
 
03:36:09.870 --> 03:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
actually more specific we don't know
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether prosus deor or tetanus vaccines
 
03:36:13.630 --> 03:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
cause autism which are
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines hence hard to make the claim
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines so cause
 
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
autism okay so um I had occasion as you
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
saw earlier to depose the world leading
 
03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinologist and I actually had an an
 
03:36:28.349 --> 03:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask him about that exact
 
03:36:30.510 --> 03:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
finding from The Institute of medicine
 
03:36:32.590 --> 03:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
maybe he knew something we didn't maybe
 
03:36:34.670 --> 03:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
he had a study we didn't know about
 
03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
right let's see what he had to say and
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
how he dealt with that
 
03:36:43.070 --> 03:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
conclusion in that Institute of medicine
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
review just I just to really put this
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
into context these Institute of medicine
 
03:36:50.590 --> 03:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
reviews they are you know uh uh hugely
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
funded things by the by by federal
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
health authorities the purpose of these
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
studies is uh in the vaccine Court hrsa
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to defend against
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury claims when we sue them
 
03:37:04.710 --> 03:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
so they commission these studies hoping
 
03:37:06.510 --> 03:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
to find the conclusion that the vaccine
 
03:37:09.990 --> 03:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
does not cause X Y or Z issue okay all
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
right I'm GNA play
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
this this is an excerpt from the I's
 
03:37:19.269 --> 03:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
report mhm right yes can you read the
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
causality conclusion with regard to
 
03:37:23.870 --> 03:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
whether dap and Tdap cause autism the
 
03:37:26.269 --> 03:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
evidence is inadequate to accept or
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
reject a causal relationship between the
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
theia toxoid tetanus toxoid or a
 
03:37:35.389 --> 03:37:35.399 align:start position:0%
cellular protest containing vaccine and
 
03:37:42.389 --> 03:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
autism don't you
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
wait until you do know until you have
 
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
the science to support
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
it to then say that vaccines do not
 
03:38:00.429 --> 03:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
goed do I wait no I do not wait because
 
03:38:03.070 --> 03:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
I have to take into account the health
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
child and and so for that reason you're
 
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay with telling the parent that dap
 
03:38:16.429 --> 03:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
Tdap does not CA
 
03:38:16.439 --> 03:38:18.229 align:start position:0%
Tdap does not CA
even

03:38:18.229 --> 03:38:18.239 align:start position:0%
even
 
03:38:20.830 --> 03:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
though the science isn't there yet to
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely this is an excerpt from the
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
I so
 
03:38:40.750 --> 03:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
um so fine maybe Dr plin is not aware of
 
03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
studies that exist I don't know so we
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
decided is we're going to go straight to
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
to the source and we foed the CDC
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
directly for all studies relied upon by
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
CDC to claim that the DAP vaccine does
 
03:38:55.670 --> 03:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
not cause autism it's on their website
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
vaccinees not cause autism we also asked
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
for all studies the CDC relied upon to
 
03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
say that endir being recom those are the
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
two he vaccines remember we looked at
 
03:39:05.229 --> 03:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
those earlier when we looked at
 
03:39:09.510 --> 03:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
movac prear 13 Hib and ipv as well as I
 
03:39:11.309 --> 03:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
asked we asked for all the studies that
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
show that cumulatively those vaccines
 
03:39:15.790 --> 03:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
don't cause autism those are each of
 
03:39:18.590 --> 03:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
those shots given three times in the
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
first six months of life okay so we foed
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
the CDC CDC says vaccines don't cause
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
autism they wouldn't uh provide any
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
studies we eventually appealed
 
03:39:33.110 --> 03:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
administratively they didn't provide any
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
studies I sue them in federal court on
 
03:39:39.950 --> 03:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of I can um and uh finally the
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice um offered up 20
 
03:39:46.830 --> 03:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
studies this is in a stipulated order
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's on your screen you could see that
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
it's uh signed by the Department of
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
Justice signed by me on behalf of I can
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it's sign entered as an order by a
 
03:39:58.750 --> 03:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
federal judge and this lists the 20
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
studies that they say they rely upon to
 
03:40:03.150 --> 03:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
claim vaccine don't CA autism for those
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
early shots here's the thing I had a
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
call with the Department of Justice
 
03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
attorney before this order was uh
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
finalized and I said Hey listen are you
 
03:40:16.510 --> 03:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
sure your client wants to sign a an
 
03:40:18.269 --> 03:40:18.279 align:start position:0%
order saying that these are the 20
 
03:40:20.670 --> 03:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
studies it's like why I said because
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
none of them involve the vaccines in the
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
first six months of life I said all of
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
them involve MMR vaccine which is given
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
at one year or involve V Mercury which
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
was taken out of vaccines back in 2000 I
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
said so you're you're providing studies
 
03:40:39.269 --> 03:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
that are not relevant to the question in
 
03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
the Foy request I said in fact I said
 
03:40:42.359 --> 03:40:44.030 align:start position:0%
the Foy request I said in fact I said
and

03:40:44.030 --> 03:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:47.590 --> 03:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
ironically you you site the 2012
 
03:40:49.950 --> 03:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
Institute of medicine
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
review that found this this is one of
 
03:40:56.910 --> 03:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
the 20 Things They cited I said so the
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
only study in this list of 20 that
 
03:41:02.349 --> 03:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
actually refers to a vaccine given in
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
the first six months of life now on the
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
current schedule is this study and it
 
03:41:09.510 --> 03:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
says it doesn't have a study to support
 
03:41:10.990 --> 03:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines cause
 
03:41:13.389 --> 03:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
autism well you could see what the doj
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
and CDC decided to do they just want the
 
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
lawsuit gone so they signed it so I want
 
03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
to reiterate and and anybody could read
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
these studies they're they are in
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
English they're available there's a link
 
03:41:26.349 --> 03:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
down there you could pull it up just
 
03:41:27.750 --> 03:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
read them maybe they thought we wouldn't
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
read I I don't know but um there they
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
are and 18 involved the Marisol MMR one
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
involved antigen not vaccine exposure
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
and that study even sayic doesn't
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
discuss whether vaccines cause autism it
 
03:41:41.750 --> 03:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
can't because it doesn't study vaccines
 
03:41:43.870 --> 03:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
and one involved MMR the mar and dap
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's the 2012 I report we just looked
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
at okay and I and I want to put a finer
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
point on this that 2012 IAM report had a
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
section on MMR and autism and it
 
03:41:58.189 --> 03:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
concluded that it threw out all the MMR
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
studies except four and it said based on
 
03:42:02.469 --> 03:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
those four Epi studies its causality
 
03:42:05.149 --> 03:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that MMR does not cause
 
03:42:07.590 --> 03:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
autism so it can make that
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
determination science can conclude that
 
03:42:12.510 --> 03:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
a vaccine doesn't cause autism it did it
 
03:42:14.830 --> 03:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
in that 2012 irm report but it hasn't
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
done it for daap or ipv or prear or
 
03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
pcv13 or Hib it didn't or or he be five
 
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
shots even three times each in the first
 
03:42:30.670 --> 03:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
six months of life okay so
 
03:42:34.070 --> 03:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
um okay well maybe the CDC doesn't
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
know and then we'll let's flip to to
 
03:42:41.070 --> 03:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
uh well I'll show you one more
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
deposition clip this one again is Dr
 
03:42:46.070 --> 03:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
kather Edwards this this isn't a lawsuit
 
03:42:47.950 --> 03:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
that actually involves vaccines and
 
03:42:50.950 --> 03:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
autism Dr Edwards was brought in as the
 
03:42:53.710 --> 03:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinologist the expert on the question
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
of whether or not this particular child
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
ended up with vaccines from autism okay
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
and here is my exchange with her when I
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
deposed her on this precise
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
question according to your profile you
 
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
have done most the
 
03:43:12.070 --> 03:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
trials many of the VAC on the
 
03:43:15.710 --> 03:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
market yes sir so
 
03:43:17.469 --> 03:43:17.479 align:start position:0%
highly experienced conducting clinical
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
trials correct I highly experienced
 
03:43:22.950 --> 03:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
conducting clinical
 
03:43:25.110 --> 03:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
trials and you're familiar with many of
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
the clinical trials that relied upon to
 
03:43:29.070 --> 03:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
license many of the vaccines currently
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
on the market correct I
 
03:43:35.149 --> 03:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
am in your
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
opinion did the clinical trials relied
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
upon license the vaces that Gat many of
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
which are still on the market
 
03:43:49.309 --> 03:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
today were they designed to rule out
 
03:44:00.349 --> 03:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine youed me into answering the
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.309 --> 03:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
yes in the extra disclosures for this
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
case it asserts that among other things
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
you will testify that quote the issue of
 
03:44:28.030 --> 03:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
whether vaccines CL autism has been
 
03:44:30.389 --> 03:44:30.399 align:start position:0%
thoroughly researched and rejected end
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
quote it's your testimony that MMR
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine cannot cause autism that's
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
correct your testimony that head vaccine
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
cannot cause autism that's correct your
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that I cannot cause autism yes
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
is your testimony that H vaccine cannot
 
03:44:45.670 --> 03:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
cause autism
 
03:44:49.309 --> 03:44:49.319 align:start position:0%
yes your testimony that vac cannot CM
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
yes your testimony that trar vac canot
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
cuse autism yes it's your daab you
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
cannot cause autism yes and you have a
 
03:45:01.710 --> 03:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
study that supports a dtab doesn't cause
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
DET do you have any study one way or
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.630 --> 03:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
I no I do not sir do you have any study
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
off I do not have any uh evidence that
 
03:45:31.670 --> 03:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
it causes ontis more than it does and
 
03:45:34.349 --> 03:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
what about
 
03:45:36.910 --> 03:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
hi vacine any evidence one way or
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
another whether
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
it what about prar vaccine any evidence
 
03:45:44.349 --> 03:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
one way or another no sir no sir and how
 
03:45:46.590 --> 03:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
about vac let me just finish are there
 
03:45:48.830 --> 03:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
any studies one way or
 
03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
another whether it does or
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mm but but not
 
03:46:04.630 --> 03:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.189 --> 03:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
no there have been studies that have
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
between um do
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
not feel credible and which study which
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
study do you are you referring to when
 
03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
you well why don't you show me the study
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
then I'll see whether I agree with
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
it so you know we have it from we have
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
it in a stipulated order from the
 
03:46:35.790 --> 03:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
federal judge we have it from uh the
 
03:46:38.910 --> 03:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
leading experts in in vaccinology
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't know where else to look
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're not we're not trying
 
03:46:44.429 --> 03:46:44.439 align:start position:0%
to hide run from the evidence or data or
 
03:46:44.439 --> 03:46:45.910 align:start position:0%
to hide run from the evidence or data or
studies

03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
studies
 
03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
we'd love to see the
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
studies love to look at them please so I
 
03:46:54.030 --> 03:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
just want to understand make sure I
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
understand what I just saw Yes um so
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was a document and it looks like
 
03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
that was initialed that someone said
 
03:47:05.229 --> 03:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
that it said that those vaccines do not
 
03:47:07.229 --> 03:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
cause autism is that what I was looking
 
03:47:09.389 --> 03:47:09.399 align:start position:0%
at or no I'm sorry that that was just
 
03:47:11.229 --> 03:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
the vaccination record of the child at
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
issue uh that that you know I was
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
brought in just to do this just to
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
depose the vaccinologist in this case
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
that involved lots of other things so
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know I just I I I don't if you got a
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
hard issue don't talk to me I don't know
 
03:47:26.389 --> 03:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
anything but but vaccines I know a
 
03:47:28.309 --> 03:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
little bit about so um I was asked to
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
depose the vaccinologist that was the
 
03:47:32.349 --> 03:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
kids that was the child's records at
 
03:47:33.790 --> 03:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
issue and so you know we were just going
 
03:47:35.710 --> 03:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
through the vaccines which Mo are most
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the vaccines on the current schedule
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
today and may I just follow up with
 
03:47:44.349 --> 03:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
something so it seemed like she was um
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
quite up upset uh that she had to answer
 
03:47:51.189 --> 03:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
these questions I didn't um and really
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
didn't want to I mean
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I guess the underlying thing was is
 
03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
she couldn't say one way or the other
 
03:48:01.950 --> 03:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
that they caused o she couldn't say that
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
it did and she couldn't say that it
 
03:48:07.349 --> 03:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
didn't right mean but what we're hearing
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
is that they
 
03:48:11.429 --> 03:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
don't right they're they're telling you
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines do not cause autism
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
categorically end of story
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
they will tell you they insent medicine
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
will conclude there are studies that MMR
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't but for the other vaccines it's
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
not like there's a debate like okay we
 
03:48:25.950 --> 03:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
have one study that shows this they
 
03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
didn't do the studies and that's what
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're hearing so my point that I want
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know I'm just using autism I'm I'm
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
not debating whether vaccines cause
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
autism I'm just using vaccines cause
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
autism claim as do not cause autism as a
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
proxy for the state of the science the
 
03:48:44.399 --> 03:48:46.870 align:start position:0%
proxy for the state of the science the
science

03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
with regards to how well our federal
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
health authorities the medical community
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
NIH funding how much does it go to
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
actually studying vaccine safety and
 
03:49:00.750 --> 03:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm telling you is that you can
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
look at the clinical trials we just did
 
03:49:04.429 --> 03:49:04.439 align:start position:0%
that and if you go on to go to PubMed
 
03:49:06.630 --> 03:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
and research vaccine safety you're going
 
03:49:10.910 --> 03:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
to uh be a really shocked at how limited
 
03:49:12.750 --> 03:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
and the dir of studies are actually done
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
please um yes so
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
um for me you know we're supposed to
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
trust what we're
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
reading from the
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
government and if they absolutely state
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
that something doesn't cause something
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
then they should be linking the studies
 
03:49:36.349 --> 03:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
to that to prove that yes um but they're
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
not um how do we know going
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
forward that we can trust
 
03:49:47.550 --> 03:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
based on evidence that we I'm not saying
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they do but I'm not saying I mean I
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
don't know based on what I just heard
 
03:49:56.670 --> 03:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
today right so I guess the question is I
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
could I'll say this much I I do think
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines are truly unique in my
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
assessment with regards to at least
 
03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
products on the market and that's
 
03:50:10.389 --> 03:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
because usually and I go back to my
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
first slides you know you have a moneyed
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
interest pushing both ways there's no
 
03:50:14.279 --> 03:50:15.229 align:start position:0%
interest pushing both ways there's no
conspir

03:50:15.229 --> 03:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
conspir
 
03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
it it there's you know you have moneyed
 
03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
interest battling each other so normally
 
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
you have on the one side you have the
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
companies want to make money on the
 
03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
other side you have the product
 
03:50:24.710 --> 03:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
liability and class action attorneys and
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
you have The Regulators who are sitting
 
03:50:27.630 --> 03:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere here on the side of the
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
consumers this is the only product that
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
I know of where you have the the you
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
have one side you have the the
 
03:50:36.110 --> 03:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies um the the the
 
03:50:37.750 --> 03:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
class action and product liability have
 
03:50:39.269 --> 03:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
been neutered they can't do anything so
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
they're out of the game and The
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
Regulators have a statutory obligation
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
to increase vaccine uptake and we'll
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
talk about later they are who you sue in
 
03:50:50.110 --> 03:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
federal court it's not even a court it's
 
03:50:52.269 --> 03:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
a you name the secretary of the
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:50:55.149 --> 03:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
when you bring a vaccine injury claim in
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
the vaccine injury Compensation Program
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of the federal court of
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
claims which is the only Court in
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
America where you typically cons Su the
 
03:51:03.870 --> 03:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
federal government for money so if you
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
if they do studies that show vaccines
 
03:51:06.680 --> 03:51:07.630 align:start position:0%
if they do studies that show vaccines
cause

03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
cause
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
harm we use that as evidence against the
 
03:51:12.389 --> 03:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
government it's the only product I know
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
where the government defends the company
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
against the consumers if you're injured
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
by a
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine government doesn't come and
 
03:51:24.790 --> 03:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
protect you they protect they they they
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
defend the product so when we sue the
 
03:51:29.229 --> 03:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Department of Health Human
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
Services for a vaccine injury for a
 
03:51:33.790 --> 03:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
little baby or a child who's the defense
 
03:51:36.269 --> 03:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
Council it's a little Law Firm it's
 
03:51:38.349 --> 03:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
called the Department of Justice have a
 
03:51:40.830 --> 03:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
lot of money a lot of lawyers and that's
 
03:51:42.469 --> 03:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
who defends against vaccine injury
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
claims they have an entire vaccine
 
03:51:46.990 --> 03:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
injury Compensation Division at the
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice they have a lot of
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
money they hire all the experts so it's
 
03:51:56.030 --> 03:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh when you say what can I trust I I I I
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
do think that your worldview doesn't
 
03:52:01.229 --> 03:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
need to explode over this at all in my
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
opinion I think that this is a this is
 
03:52:06.269 --> 03:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
really a it's a unique thing it's and
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's ironic because the claim the
 
03:52:11.590 --> 03:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines cause a saying anything about
 
03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines and autism makes you
 
03:52:16.189 --> 03:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
anti-science makes you antivaxer makes
 
03:52:18.830 --> 03:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
you into a category of being a nut but
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
ironically incredibly and I understand
 
03:52:23.229 --> 03:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
it can be a bit can cause cognitive
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
dissonance I'm certain for for for many
 
03:52:29.149 --> 03:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
folks when they see this because you're
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
like like what you just said well if I
 
03:52:34.750 --> 03:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
can't trust that their vaccines don't
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
cause autism not claiming because they
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
haven't done the studies what else can't
 
03:52:40.349 --> 03:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
I trust I I don't know I I really do put
 
03:52:42.110 --> 03:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines in their own kind of box when
 
03:52:44.110 --> 03:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to products because they are in
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
that category if if if they didn't have
 
03:52:49.469 --> 03:52:49.479 align:start position:0%
the 19 sax immunity you wouldn't be in
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
the scenario to to undo the issue with
 
03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines in my opinion all you got to do
 
03:52:54.750 --> 03:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
is lift the immunity let the market
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
forces do what they normally do and and
 
03:52:59.229 --> 03:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
and get rid of the government defending
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines in vaccine court and so forth
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
let let them operate like any other
 
03:53:05.389 --> 03:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
product let them rise and fall on their
 
03:53:07.510 --> 03:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
merits which is what we've always done
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
right we you rise and fall in the merits
 
03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
not not based on coercion and mandates
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
and bullying and kick them out of school
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
and kick them out of work I mean that's
 
03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
what bullies and Thugs and dictators do
 
03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
throughout history when they can't
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
convince on the merits thank you
 
03:53:19.359 --> 03:53:20.630 align:start position:0%
convince on the merits thank you
representative

03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and for
 
03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps the eenth time today I'm
 
03:53:26.790 --> 03:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat shocked by some of what I've
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
just seen and I'd like to just offer a
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
summary to see if this is accurate for
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're seeing and what
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
you've testified and what you've shown
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
us which
 
03:53:41.189 --> 03:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
is trusted experts within the field
 
03:53:44.429 --> 03:53:44.439 align:start position:0%
making unqualified objective claim
 
03:53:48.349 --> 03:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
claims as to the lack of a causitive
 
03:53:51.389 --> 03:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
factor between this medical product and
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
a and a
 
03:53:56.830 --> 03:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.269 --> 03:53:59.279 align:start position:0%
definitively then admitting in
 
03:54:02.590 --> 03:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
deposition that there is no not just
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
definitive but no real evidence
 
03:54:07.189 --> 03:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
suggesting those claims
 
03:54:07.199 --> 03:54:08.750 align:start position:0%
suggesting those claims
are

03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
correct which leaves you guessing why
 
03:54:12.189 --> 03:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
would they do something like this but
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
then again we don't really have the
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
guess because there was another death
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
position of a
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman in which case he seemed to
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that the noble
 
03:54:23.790 --> 03:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
lie was
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
warranted to
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
manipulate people into increasing the
 
03:54:31.550 --> 03:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
uptake of this product because it was
 
03:54:34.349 --> 03:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
because he assessed that on the on the
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
total scale of things that he believes
 
03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
people would be better off with it than
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
without it is that generally what we're
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
seeing here I think the word belief is
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
apt and I will tell you that is a lot of
 
03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
what I see in this Arena uh about
 
03:54:50.229 --> 03:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines there's a lot of beliefs around
 
03:54:52.269 --> 03:54:52.279 align:start position:0%
the product and they really are in many
 
03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
instances like religious belief people
 
03:54:56.269 --> 03:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
get upset they get angry sometimes when
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
you say things about vaccines that they
 
03:54:59.469 --> 03:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
think are right or they think are they
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
think they're wrong um because they
 
03:55:04.189 --> 03:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't really have in my experience folks
 
03:55:07.510 --> 03:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
get upset in depositions because um you
 
03:55:10.269 --> 03:55:10.279 align:start position:0%
know uh I depose lots of different
 
03:55:11.990 --> 03:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and you know when
 
03:55:14.070 --> 03:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
they then they don't have a a knowledge
 
03:55:15.670 --> 03:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
based face to draw on they don't have
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
the facts the data themselves they just
 
03:55:19.710 --> 03:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
believe it then they can only draw on
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
their emotion to respond they can't draw
 
03:55:24.070 --> 03:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
on their intellect and that creates some
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
of these uh more interesting moments and
 
03:55:27.590 --> 03:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
depositions in my
 
03:55:29.550 --> 03:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
opinion I I don't know if that answers
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
your question but yes yes it is it I I
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
it is it is a um yes it's it's an
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate State of Affairs thank you
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
and if I made just one followup would it
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
then be your opinion that um that there
 
03:55:49.389 --> 03:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
is at least at times in entrenched sort
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
of I don't know if party line is the
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
right word it's not a party but an
 
03:55:53.479 --> 03:55:55.429 align:start position:0%
right word it's not a party but an
entrenched

03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
entrenched
 
03:55:59.950 --> 03:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
ideological line that is expected of
 
03:56:03.389 --> 03:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
people in this profession to follow
 
03:56:06.910 --> 03:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely and you can bring on a um
 
03:56:10.590 --> 03:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
a whole Litany of folks who are medical
 
03:56:13.990 --> 03:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
professionals um who up until the moment
 
03:56:15.830 --> 03:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
in time when they said something against
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
the grain about these products were LED
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
in their profession considered experts
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
but cutting across on this issue is very
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
problematic um you know car
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturers do a very good job
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
protecting their product they have
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars every year they put
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
that money into PR campaigns with Fifth
 
03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
Avenue firms to promote their cars to
 
03:56:37.830 --> 03:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that good things are said
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
about them and then when the headline
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
comes out about car having this or that
 
03:56:44.309 --> 03:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
issue they go into they did pharmaceu
 
03:56:45.550 --> 03:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
companies do the same thing and it's
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
smart it's just good business they spend
 
03:56:48.910 --> 03:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars every year promoting
 
03:56:50.309 --> 03:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
their products they have a kitty they
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
have PR firms but they just do it
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
through um their their chosen method is
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
basically to do it through uh um what
 
03:57:00.149 --> 03:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
they what they
 
03:57:03.750 --> 03:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
cons folks who are viewed as uh experts
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
and trusted Professionals in in out
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
there it's not nefarious it's just the
 
03:57:10.110 --> 03:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
way it works in the sense that they hold
 
03:57:11.550 --> 03:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
conventions they hold meetings they have
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
Symposium you know they're they law the
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
products your typical pediatrician I
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
think is a good person they they don't
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
they just don't know they don't they've
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
never looked at the clinical trial data
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
I've deposed pediatricians who've gone
 
03:57:26.269 --> 03:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
their whole career never looked at the
 
03:57:29.189 --> 03:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
packager at one time no clue in fact I
 
03:57:30.550 --> 03:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever depos a
 
03:57:33.269 --> 03:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who knew anything about the
 
03:57:34.990 --> 03:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
clinical trials of these products or any
 
03:57:37.309 --> 03:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
or any of that so they yeah you know
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're going through the day they're
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
just they have they trust what and and
 
03:57:42.550 --> 03:57:42.560 align:start position:0%
the truth is is that how could they get
 
03:57:43.990 --> 03:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
through their day without it they open
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
the physician Desk Reference guide
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
there's a million things they got to do
 
03:57:50.349 --> 03:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
every day diagnose and look at right um
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
and so they get through their day by
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
just following what the guidance
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
provides it's similar in this product
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to these products except
 
03:58:01.790 --> 03:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
that um they really just don't realize
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
the the the complete imbalance in in how
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
these products uh are operate in the
 
03:58:08.790 --> 03:58:08.800 align:start position:0%
real world that started slowly in the
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
80s with the immunity and has just it's
 
03:58:13.830 --> 03:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
just gone it's just really gone wild in
 
03:58:16.830 --> 03:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
my opinion over the
 
03:58:20.149 --> 03:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
decades representative
 
03:58:22.750 --> 03:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
Penza so just while you're talking I
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
just did a little quick search and um
 
03:58:31.349 --> 03:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
this is a um it is a 501c3 organization
 
03:58:35.990 --> 03:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's called immun immunize.org and so I
 
03:58:38.990 --> 03:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
just want to read this medical and legal
 
03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
authorities it's first the title is
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
evidence shows vac vaccines unrelated to
 
03:58:43.520 --> 03:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
evidence shows vac vaccines unrelated to
autism

03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
autism
 
03:58:46.830 --> 03:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
medical and legal authorities agree that
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
no evidence exists that vaccines cause
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
autism The Institute of medicine is an
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
impartial group of the world's leading
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
experts that advises Congress on science
 
03:58:57.469 --> 03:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
issues after reviewing more than 200
 
03:58:58.990 --> 03:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
studies in
 
03:59:02.510 --> 03:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
2004 and more than a thousand studies in
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
2011 their report strongly stated that
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
the evidence did not show a link between
 
03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines and autism in 2014 researchers
 
03:59:13.750 --> 03:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the Rand Corporation published an
 
03:59:16.590 --> 03:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
update date to the 2011 Institute of
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
medicines report in a systematic review
 
03:59:21.149 --> 03:59:21.159 align:start position:0%
of The Evidence published on vaccine
 
03:59:23.630 --> 03:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
safety to date they found the evidence
 
03:59:25.910 --> 03:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
was strong and then they go into that
 
03:59:28.590 --> 03:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
the MMR vaccine is not associated with
 
03:59:30.710 --> 03:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
autism now they didn't talk about that
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
this kind of goes back to what you were
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
saying how they jumped to MMR but why
 
03:59:39.790 --> 03:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
not go after so if we've got the
 
03:59:43.830 --> 03:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
government that has you know uh or the
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
back vaccine manufacturers that have
 
03:59:49.469 --> 03:59:49.479 align:start position:0%
this blanket immunity why not go after
 
03:59:52.269 --> 03:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
this why not we know that what was just
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
stated here is a complete lie this is a
 
03:59:57.950 --> 03:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
501c3 organizations that is promoting
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
that and they are blatantly providing
 
04:00:03.630 --> 04:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
misinformation and this is just based
 
04:00:06.429 --> 04:00:06.439 align:start position:0%
upon looking at this quite a big um
 
04:00:08.550 --> 04:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
organization so that's just one example
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure of probably a over a thousand I
 
04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
I I believe that the the solution to
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
speech that's wrong is more speech never
 
04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
censorship certainly not by the
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
government ever way you view is you know
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
danger today by speech everybody thinks
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
the other person's saying something
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's dangerous so I I never I think
 
04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
the big greatest danger is always the
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
cent of speech Free Speech comes with
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
dangerous to be sure but the greater
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
sens sensory and that's a really
 
04:00:35.469 --> 04:00:35.479 align:start position:0%
interesting quote actually because they
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
were talking first about the 2004 I
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
review which had didn't which involved
 
04:00:42.030 --> 04:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
MMR in the Marisol they then they talk
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
about 2011 or 201 12 it's um depends on
 
04:00:47.469 --> 04:00:47.479 align:start position:0%
where you look in this sometimes I I
 
04:00:50.149 --> 04:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
call 2011 what we just looked at it did
 
04:00:52.750 --> 04:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
not conclude that dtab doesn't catism
 
04:00:55.630 --> 04:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
and the 2014 one is super interesting
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
because what they're talking about is an
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
as ahrq vaccine study if I could pull it
 
04:01:02.750 --> 04:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
up if if I'll get lucky and I know that
 
04:01:05.070 --> 04:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
study the one that they talked about and
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
that study from 2014 was an update to
 
04:01:10.110 --> 04:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
the HHS one and it again concluded that
 
04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have any evidence for daap
 
04:01:13.389 --> 04:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
but what's great about that one is if I
 
04:01:15.950 --> 04:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
if I could find find it is that they
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
looked at and autism too and for
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
 they only found one study this
 
04:01:23.469 --> 04:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
Goodman study that found a three time
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
risk amongst kids that got headb and who
 
04:01:28.790 --> 04:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
didn't get headb and so here I'll even
 
04:01:31.910 --> 04:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
see I could pull it up right
 
04:01:31.920 --> 04:01:34.630 align:start position:0%
see I could pull it up right
now

04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:01:38.389 --> 04:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
um oh this is the 2021 version oh they
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
probably took down the 20204
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
version all right well I'll have to do
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
that another time then because it's not
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to be on their site anymore uh but
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 2014 version which I
 
04:01:53.229 --> 04:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
it has a whole section he be and
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
autism and that's what it shows so it's
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
quite ironic that that that's what they
 
04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
say but that's but that's what you'll
 
04:02:00.910 --> 04:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
typically get um you'll get these
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
conclusory statements if you look under
 
04:02:06.070 --> 04:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
the hood like we did the at the direct
 
04:02:08.110 --> 04:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
primary sources you get a different
 
04:02:10.349 --> 04:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
conclusion represent
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair yeah so
 
04:02:15.790 --> 04:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
there's a point where something's Free
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
Speech right but then there's a point
 
04:02:20.590 --> 04:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
where isn't it I mean that is that is
 
04:02:22.830 --> 04:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
blatantly saying that that there
 
04:02:26.429 --> 04:02:26.439 align:start position:0%
were 400 you know excuse me 200 studies
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
and more than a thousand which those
 
04:02:30.990 --> 04:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't exist and then they're basically
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
saying that what the report says is
 
04:02:37.229 --> 04:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
definiely saying that there is um no
 
04:02:39.510 --> 04:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
evidence when that's not what the report
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
said so there's a point where it's it's
 
04:02:44.710 --> 04:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
lying it's not just Free Speech though
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
and we're I mean this is affecting
 
04:02:48.990 --> 04:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of people that are
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
making these decisions and that's why
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
people should always have choice in my
 
04:02:55.269 --> 04:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day solution to me in
 
04:02:57.950 --> 04:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
my mind is less government not more and
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
um and they're just conflating and I
 
04:03:02.790 --> 04:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
agree misrepresenting because they're
 
04:03:04.990 --> 04:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
saying hundreds thousands they mean in
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
the report in total which covers lots of
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
other things and then they digress in
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
that quote to talk about autism making
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
it a appear as if those studies are all
 
04:03:18.990 --> 04:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
about autism they're not the whole the
 
04:03:22.149 --> 04:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
quote you read is incredibly misleading
 
04:03:25.229 --> 04:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
in my opinion uh so I I agree with you
 
04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
but but here here it is I mean this is a
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
private organization do we really want
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
the government sensor listen in the same
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
way that the government probably says if
 
04:03:36.429 --> 04:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
you say vaccines you know uh just look
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
at Brian look at um Maddie dear just for
 
04:03:41.830 --> 04:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
telling her
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
story they said that's false information
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
and they censored her her mother and
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
anybody that sought to repost just their
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
own personal story she say this is what
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
happened to me it's always dangerous in
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
my opinion it's it's the greater danger
 
04:03:59.790 --> 04:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
to censor speech always um and you know
 
04:04:02.630 --> 04:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
represent leus yeah I did notice that
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
they worded it very carefully so that
 
04:04:08.790 --> 04:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
they did not actually lie they said
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
there was no evidence to link them what
 
04:04:12.910 --> 04:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't say was that there was no
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
evidence to the contrary either right so
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
it makes it sound like it's fine they're
 
04:04:23.309 --> 04:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
not related just but what we saw from
 
04:04:26.750 --> 04:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
what you had was yes there's no evidence
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
either way but they carefully just gave
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
one so it wasn't a lie it was just
 
04:04:34.750 --> 04:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
misleading is that what the language
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
said no link yeah so the um the header
 
04:04:42.149 --> 04:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
is evidence shows vaccines unrelated to
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
autism and then it's says medical and
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
legal authorities agree that no evidence
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
exists that vaccines cause autism yeah
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
but they don't tell you there's no
 
04:04:56.110 --> 04:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that it doesn't cause autism I
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
and I would I would tell you that there
 
04:05:02.349 --> 04:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
are a uh a lot of medical professionals
 
04:05:03.910 --> 04:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
who would take strong disagreement that
 
04:05:07.229 --> 04:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
there's no evidence that vaccines have
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
potentially I mean look we know this
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
much and really I didn't want to debate
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines and autism but um you know
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
autism is a dsm5 diagnosis it's a
 
04:05:20.590 --> 04:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
psychiatric diagnosis right so really
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it's in the dsm5 so it's a it's a
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
symptomatology and if you meet those
 
04:05:29.389 --> 04:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
those three categories of symptoms you
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
get that diagnosis it doesn't that tells
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
you nothing about the ideology doesn't
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
tell you anything about what causes it
 
04:05:38.510 --> 04:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
if you have lead poisoning and you end
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
up with those symptoms you can end up
 
04:05:42.349 --> 04:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
potentially with that diagnosis but
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
they'll really just say you have lead
 
04:05:43.359 --> 04:05:44.990 align:start position:0%
they'll really just say you have lead
poison

04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
poison
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
right so so saying autism is just it's
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
just a set of features basically so for
 
04:05:55.389 --> 04:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
example we know prusa vaccine you look
 
04:05:58.070 --> 04:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
at the Pack's insert it will tell you
 
04:05:59.790 --> 04:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
right a contraindication is if your
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
child has had here I'll pull it up let's
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
we could look at it together quickly um
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
but so that you
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
know so we can go to FDA licensed
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines um
 
04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
and if we go down and we look at you
 
04:06:18.110 --> 04:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
know at a a deept
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine can look at that we go to the
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
package insert here it is this is given
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
a 24 and six months and it will tell you
 
04:06:25.880 --> 04:06:27.429 align:start position:0%
a 24 and six months and it will tell you
directly

04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
directly
 
04:06:27.439 --> 04:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
directly
that

04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
if contraindications so it says incopy
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
which means coma decreased level of
 
04:06:40.870 --> 04:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
Consciousness and prolonged seizure
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
within 7 Days of a previous dose of
 
04:06:44.550 --> 04:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
protest containing
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
that is not attributable to another
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
identifiable cause is a contr indication
 
04:06:49.950 --> 04:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
administration of any protos Vine
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
including dapto cell that's the way
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
dapto cell describes it and then I'll
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
just to show you that the other one also
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
infinis similarly has the same conations
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
of both of the DTaP vaccines also says
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
in section
 
04:07:07.750 --> 04:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
4.2 it
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
says same
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
thing you could read it there so in
 
04:07:15.349 --> 04:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
sopath means brain damage that's what it
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
means all right um en sephtis means
 
04:07:22.189 --> 04:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
inflammation of the brain incopy means a
 
04:07:24.429 --> 04:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
pathology of the brain so you have some
 
04:07:27.389 --> 04:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
actual brain damage now coma decreased
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
level of conscious prolonged seizures
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
are the softer uh uh examples of incopy
 
04:07:35.389 --> 04:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
there's worse and there's been a lot of
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
cases compensating the vaccine injury
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program of children who
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
have significant debilitating brain d
 
04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
image after a pressus vaccine containing
 
04:07:49.269 --> 04:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine who've been compensated in
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
vicp and um um and for those children
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
there have been a a num many of them
 
04:07:56.910 --> 04:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
also had
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
autism because they have the
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
features the symptoms that give them
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
that diagnosis now the vaccine court is
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
not compensating you for autism
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
compensate you for theopathy for the
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
brain damage right because that's the
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
actual physical manifestation the fact
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
that you end up with a psychiatric
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
condition that can be diagnosed as
 
04:08:18.950 --> 04:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
autism that's not what's can be
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
considered directly compensated but I
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
mean did the vaccine which caused a seal
 
04:08:27.550 --> 04:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
opathy result in the autism well you can
 
04:08:30.269 --> 04:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
read a peer riew there's a a Law Journal
 
04:08:32.429 --> 04:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
article by Mary Holland where she
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
actually documents she had her uh her
 
04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
law students at NYU when she was a
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
professor at NYU they went through all
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
the case files and they found a few
 
04:08:42.109 --> 04:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
dozen cases where really based on that
 
04:08:43.790 --> 04:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
laww article they said yeah they were
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
compensating for autism but they just
 
04:08:48.189 --> 04:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
they just hid it in other conditions
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
right so um uh with all of that said you
 
04:08:52.880 --> 04:08:53.950 align:start position:0%
right so um uh with all of that said you
know

04:08:53.950 --> 04:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
um you know it the important point
 
04:09:00.269 --> 04:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
though is is really that you know when
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
when the medical community says oh we
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
have you know we we thoroughly study
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety like they do with covid
 
04:09:08.269 --> 04:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines oh don't worry we thoroughly
 
04:09:10.910 --> 04:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
studied covid-19 vaccine safety because
 
04:09:13.710 --> 04:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
right um
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
I I I I use autism as the way to show
 
04:09:21.630 --> 04:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
that there's question marks when they
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
make that claim and I don't think that
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
any government should force anybody to
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
get this product they should let them do
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
their own homework because even with the
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
most the claim that they the the injury
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
they claim they have most thoroughly
 
04:09:37.950 --> 04:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
studied autism they haven't done it um
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
this is the childhood vaccine schedule
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
right now actually without covid vaccine
 
04:09:43.469 --> 04:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
and you could see they've studied MMR
 
04:09:45.630 --> 04:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
the yellow and that's of the ingredients
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
they studied that one the marasol that's
 
04:09:49.389 --> 04:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
what they've studied for
 
04:09:52.269 --> 04:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
autism um I could show you a video of
 
04:09:54.269 --> 04:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
why it's important to you know to study
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
this if you would like this is a family
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
with triplets um who all three of their
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
kids developed autism shortly after a
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
det after a prevenar vaccine or do you
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.199 --> 04:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
going

04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay we have triplet two boys and a girl
 
04:10:15.750 --> 04:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
Richie Robbie and Claire every day in
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
our life was a party every single day
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
they were smiling and laughing and
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
looking at each other engaging in each
 
04:10:26.910 --> 04:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
other on June
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
25th 2007 we brought him in for the numo
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
shot my daughter still has the mark on
 
04:10:34.750 --> 04:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
her light from the shot she was the
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
first one to get it and she screamed and
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
never really stopped screaming after
 
04:10:41.149 --> 04:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
that but we Contin we didn't know we did
 
04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
the boys as well
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
by noon Claire shut completely off it
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
was as if she was blind and deaf and all
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
she did at that moment was stare at the
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
ceiling van so that was at noon we had
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
the shot at 10:00
 
04:10:55.720 --> 04:10:57.309 align:start position:0%
the shot at 10:00
a.m.

04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
a.m.
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
2:00 we watched Richie shut off they
 
04:11:03.109 --> 04:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
lost all their reflexes um I'm an
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
educational audiologist I actually did
 
04:11:07.630 --> 04:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
the test for the stapedial reflex which
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
is a little muscle in the middle ear
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
just to see if a muscle they can't
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
control was still working and it it
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
didn't um The sedal Reflex dampens sound
 
04:11:19.710 --> 04:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
so your ears don't hurt from a really
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
loud sound and both of them had no
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
stapedial reflex they stopped blinking
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
stopped yawning stopped coughing stopped
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
sneezing the worst is we the shut down
 
04:11:34.750 --> 04:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
we were told it was genetic and then we
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
were told by geneticist that there's no
 
04:11:38.910 --> 04:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
possible way three children would shut
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
off on the same day so we had severe
 
04:11:42.800 --> 04:11:44.229 align:start position:0%
off on the same day so we had severe
autis

04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
autis
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
um Spectrum Disorder for all three kids
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
entering kindergarten we have spent
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars trying
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
to them the only person that we got back
 
04:11:58.269 --> 04:11:58.279 align:start position:0%
is Rich
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
Robbie the one that was last to shut off
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
Richie can only say singles maybe two
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
words together Claire is still
 
04:12:09.429 --> 04:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
completely nonverbal not P trained and
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
Robbie is approaching grade level but
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
severe OCD what do you do Property
 
04:12:16.960 --> 04:12:18.950 align:start position:0%
severe OCD what do you do Property
Management

04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
Management
 
04:12:21.229 --> 04:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
um want me tell you what a day in our
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
life so you got say a six or seven or
 
04:12:27.149 --> 04:12:27.159 align:start position:0%
eight year old child who's not potty
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
trained and a two or three 4 o' in the
 
04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
morning they build their diap assum it's
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
pretty uncomfortable so they take it off
 
04:12:37.590 --> 04:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
pretty soon pretty soon it's all over
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
them it's all over the bed in shorted
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
order it's all over me it's all over her
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm snapping at her she's snapping at
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
me we're both snapping at the kid who is
 
04:12:51.309 --> 04:12:51.319 align:start position:0%
the only innocent party in the whole
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
scenario and the one thing that's
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
conspicuously absent in that scenario is
 
04:13:00.830 --> 04:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh is anybody who told you that shot was
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
safe they're all asleep in their bed
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
they haven't got a problem in
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.590 --> 04:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
so when you think about
 
04:13:32.600 --> 04:13:36.429 align:start position:0%
so when you think about
um

04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh what the science Community or the way
 
04:13:41.950 --> 04:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
the FDA and CDC and NIH and all of them
 
04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
approach vaccine saf
 
04:13:43.720 --> 04:13:45.109 align:start position:0%
approach vaccine saf
Vis

04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
Vis
 
04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
autism it it it gives you a backdrop in
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
which and how they approach covid
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety and if you think autism
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
is an aberration even though it's the
 
04:13:56.550 --> 04:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
thing they say they've studied the most
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
I'll quickly run through just a few
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
other things for other vaccines and then
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
we'll switch it over to to covid vaccine
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay um so um going back to the 2012 ior
 
04:14:13.630 --> 04:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
report we talked about earlier
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I noted to you then that the CDC and
 
04:14:18.189 --> 04:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
HRC paid the to review what they said
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
were the 158 most commonly claimed
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
serious injuries from vaccines now these
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
are the ones that they say are the most
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
commonly claimed
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
injuries in that review the I found that
 
04:14:32.590 --> 04:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
for 18 of them evidence supported a
 
04:14:33.790 --> 04:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
causal relationship and these are
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
serious reactions okay so they said yeah
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines cause
 
04:14:39.630 --> 04:14:39.640 align:start position:0%
18 which is
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
troubling five of the issues they
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
rejected including MMR and autism was
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
five but this maybe is the most
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
troubling for 135 of the most commonly
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
claimed serious injuries from vaccines
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
by their admission the evidence was
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
insufficient to reach conclusion they
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
hadn't done the studies they don't know
 
04:15:04.269 --> 04:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
because their clinical trial data is
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
vacuous as we've seen and they just
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't do the studies otherwise for the
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
most part just like autism there's a
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
link to the in medicine report you could
 
04:15:16.750 --> 04:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
see it directly and I would focus on the
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh on there's a summary table
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
where you can look at all of the
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
conditions by vaccine and what the ca
 
04:15:26.790 --> 04:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
Sol conclusion
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
is if that's not suff so that gives us a
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
sense of again that they're not studying
 
04:15:33.750 --> 04:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
the again it repeat it shows again
 
04:15:35.429 --> 04:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
they're not studying even the most
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
commonly claimed injuries what injuries
 
04:15:40.910 --> 04:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
can vaccines cause okay now in the
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
package insert we looked at se 6.1
 
04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
before remember and it that showed the
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trial experience well in
 
04:15:46.560 --> 04:15:47.349 align:start position:0%
clinical trial experience well in
section

04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
6.2 is the postmarketing
 
04:15:54.149 --> 04:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
experience okay and that is after it's
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
licensed the manufacturer if they have a
 
04:15:59.229 --> 04:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
Bion to believe there's a causal not
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
correlation causal relationship between
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and the injury they're
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to put it in section 6.2
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to put stuff in
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's just correlation how do I know
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
that I'll read you the Federal
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
Regulation this is the code of Federal
 
04:16:18.109 --> 04:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
Regulation section 21 CFR 2 1.57 and it
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
provides that package interest vaccine
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
should include quote
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
only only those Adverse Events for which
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
there is some basically there's a causal
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
relationship between the drug and occurr
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
to the adverse event not correlation
 
04:16:35.229 --> 04:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
causal relationship and I can tell you
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
in practice in practice from my
 
04:16:40.349 --> 04:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
experience and you can go and look at
 
04:16:43.070 --> 04:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
the licensure documents so forth they
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
really only put stuff in vaccine package
 
04:16:47.469 --> 04:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
inserts where they really see a causal
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
relationship because under the 1986 act
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
for the most
 
04:16:54.030 --> 04:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
part you can still get them for fraud so
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
if they have they know it can cause and
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
they don't put it in there you can you
 
04:17:01.389 --> 04:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
can potentially sue them but otherwise
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
they're not really concerned about
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
putting it in there so really when they
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
have evidence and and here's a let me
 
04:17:09.269 --> 04:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
show you the reflection of that here is
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
Spike fact this is mad's covid vaccine
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is the only issues they disclosed
 
04:17:16.269 --> 04:17:16.279 align:start position:0%
at least when I took that screenshot in
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
section 6.2 post marketing they got
 
04:17:21.030 --> 04:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
myocarditis pericarditis right
 
04:17:23.309 --> 04:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis and synup meaning fainting
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's it that's all they
 
04:17:28.269 --> 04:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
disclose now we know a lot of the there
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
are a lot of other injuries neuropathies
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
and so forth but they're not in this
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
because madna didn't reach the point
 
04:17:37.710 --> 04:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
where they have like you know they they
 
04:17:39.109 --> 04:17:39.119 align:start position:0%
really only put stuff where they feel
 
04:17:43.870 --> 04:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
like they have to admit it okay
 
04:17:45.990 --> 04:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
here's that here's what's disclosed for
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
that hepatitis B vaccine that we looked
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
at earlier a combox HB given to a one-
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
baby these are serious
 
04:17:57.790 --> 04:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
conditions I'm not saying I don't I
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
can't tell you the rate at which these
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
happen but I know they happen enough for
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
the pharmaceutical
 
04:18:05.910 --> 04:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
company to believe to have evidence to
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
believe they're causally related to
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
disclose them in the package
 
04:18:12.229 --> 04:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
insert I don't write the federal RS
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's just what they are uh yes so
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
unless you're actually before you go to
 
04:18:23.070 --> 04:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
your pediatrician or your doctor or
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
whatever to get a shot unless you
 
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
actually do your research and read this
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
data technically you have no idea
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
because they don't really give you this
 
04:18:36.429 --> 04:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
information at the doctor's so they
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
won't really disclose it is that correct
 
04:18:41.870 --> 04:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh pediatricians that vaccinate children
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm aware not provide this
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
information to their patients before
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
administering vaccines they don't even
 
04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
provide typically there's something
 
04:18:50.590 --> 04:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
under federal law they're supposed to
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
give called the vaccine information
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
sheet the 1986 Act created this ADV
 
04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
required the CDC create a short little
 
04:18:59.229 --> 04:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
thing called the vaccine information
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
sheet that has certain disclosures and
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
under federal law pediatricians are
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to provide that before they
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
administer vaccines and um you know I
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a survey but um I I'm I'm I
 
04:19:12.750 --> 04:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
know that it's common for them not even
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
to give that minimal
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I was just going to ask about
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
that disclosure in relation um with uh
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccines um there was Zero
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
informed consent with the eua vaccines
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
but were were they given that kind of
 
04:19:37.990 --> 04:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
pass as well in regards with that
 
04:19:41.309 --> 04:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
because of course every every uh vaccine
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
insert was blank it set on there
 
04:19:48.109 --> 04:19:48.119 align:start position:0%
intentionally blank I have those um so
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
and then um I have another question as a
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
followup but I just you know my children
 
04:19:57.750 --> 04:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
re you know we received those the sheet
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about but it did not
 
04:20:03.389 --> 04:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
give uh the level of information that
 
04:20:06.429 --> 04:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
would cause a parent to say oh well
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
maybe we we won't go through that it was
 
04:20:13.830 --> 04:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
more very minor fever dis comfort that
 
04:20:17.389 --> 04:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
kind of thing not not those types of
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
serious things that were on an insert
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
and um the other piece is too um when
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
you ask the pediatrician For That
 
04:20:29.229 --> 04:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine insert and I've done this myself
 
04:20:33.550 --> 04:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
multiple times um we were flat out told
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
no if you could share
 
04:20:37.040 --> 04:20:39.990 align:start position:0%
no if you could share
what

04:20:39.990 --> 04:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:20:45.149 --> 04:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
sorry so yeah if in regards with the
 
04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines there was no informed
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
consent no handouts no nothing that was
 
04:20:52.910 --> 04:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
given I mean in in New Hampshire there
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
was there was nothing so I kind of want
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
to in in a traditional sense with
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
traditional vaccines what they're
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to do which is not necessarily
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
always uh you know um yeah and it's very
 
04:21:06.149 --> 04:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
very hard almost impossible to find
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
anything on the internet for traditional
 
04:21:10.149 --> 04:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines without just saying do it do it
 
04:21:13.469 --> 04:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
do it right so um but when it came to
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
covid even the minimal that we knew
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
right was thrown out the window um in
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I mean we had we had
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
drivethru vaccination clinics in malls
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh we had it at the New Hampshire Motor
 
04:21:29.030 --> 04:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
Speedway and you drive up in your car
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
and you get your shot there was no
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
informed consent these people didn't
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
even know what they were doing some of
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
them that were doing those injections so
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
I just kind of want to kind of
 
04:21:42.189 --> 04:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
understand where we were at where we had
 
04:21:42.199 --> 04:21:43.070 align:start position:0%
understand where we were at where we had
something

04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then we went into absolutely
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
nothing I mean the I mean there is a V
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
for covid vaccines now back then they
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
did have something that they had put
 
04:21:57.389 --> 04:21:57.399 align:start position:0%
together for when it was eua for
 
04:21:59.149 --> 04:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
patients there was a document I'm not
 
04:22:03.550 --> 04:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
aware of uh if it was distributed or or
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I suspect it was given out as
 
04:22:07.790 --> 04:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
frequently as the VIS was before
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines was given to parents
 
04:22:11.830 --> 04:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
for childhood vaccines but those V's are
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
the approach that that the CDC takes in
 
04:22:15.070 --> 04:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
terms of Designing them is they don't
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
want to scare parents away they have a
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
policy for increasing vaccine updates
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
they have metrics for how many children
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
the percentage that they want to hit for
 
04:22:24.429 --> 04:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
children vaccinated they have no
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
percentage for how many kids they want
 
04:22:26.790 --> 04:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure aren't injured from a
 
04:22:28.670 --> 04:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine there's no focus on that
 
04:22:29.950 --> 04:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that's not where the money
 
04:22:31.309 --> 04:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
flows it's not where the focus is the
 
04:22:33.710 --> 04:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
focus is on vaccine uptake and so those
 
04:22:36.510 --> 04:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
V's are are specifically designed in
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
fact um you know the VIS has used to
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
have a bit more disclosure in terms of
 
04:22:43.229 --> 04:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
harm for example the MMR vaccine package
 
04:22:47.309 --> 04:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh V used to literally say brain damage
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
as a as a potential harm those are the
 
04:22:52.670 --> 04:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
words brain damage um Dr Stanley plin
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
was not happy about the deposition I
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
think that uh he had with me and I we
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
have foed for all his emails with this
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
CDC and the FDA he went on a campaign to
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
get them to update their V's to remove a
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
whole a whole host of you know uh
 
04:23:11.990 --> 04:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
potential harms that are disclosed and
 
04:23:14.269 --> 04:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
to put them into broader term buckets U
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
we have we have those emails they
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
they're quite they're quite interesting
 
04:23:21.630 --> 04:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean the disclosure prevx the
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
disclosures that occurred even before
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
covid were you know I mean you go into a
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
typical pediatric office they'll tell
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
you safe and effective nothing to worry
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
about don't worry whatsoever um and you
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
know often times what they'll say to you
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
is look children have gotten healthier
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
because of vaccines look look at look
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
look around kids aren't dying every day
 
04:23:42.030 --> 04:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
right um well let's talk about that for
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
one second second and and then I think
 
04:23:45.630 --> 04:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
we're ready to get back to covid
 
04:23:47.990 --> 04:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines um you see in front of you the
 
04:23:50.510 --> 04:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
difference between vaccination schedule
 
04:23:53.590 --> 04:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
for the CDC from during pregnancy and up
 
04:23:56.510 --> 04:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
to 12 months uh you could go down there
 
04:23:59.550 --> 04:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
there a CDC link you can that link down
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
there has all the CDC uh vaccine
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
schedules going all the way back to I
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
believe 83 so you can go see them for
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
yourself and this is a representation of
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
them um 86 there were three routine
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines as we talked about GTP opv
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
there was also MMR but that's after one
 
04:24:17.309 --> 04:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
year of age this is again up to 12
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
months um if we did the all up to 18
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
years we that we would need a lot bigger
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
picture so this is up to 12 months and
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
then those are the rest of the shots um
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
I and I can tell you this thing is is
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
accurate so um quite a big difference
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
well you know uh have kids gotten
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
healthier since the 80s good question
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
right I mean that's that's what we've
 
04:24:44.830 --> 04:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
been looking to accomplish here 1986
 
04:24:46.990 --> 04:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
according to the uh the available data
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
12.8% of kids had a chronic health
 
04:24:50.229 --> 04:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
condition in
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
America we have now in 2017 at least had
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
53 doses of vaccine
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
54% um have a chronic health condition
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
in America as of 2011 according to one
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
CDC study take out obesity and it's
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
still close to 50% so high 40s so you
 
04:25:13.229 --> 04:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
know you've got um a a lock step
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
increase to be sure I'm saying
 
04:25:18.030 --> 04:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
correlation I'm saying correlation but
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
you have a correlative increase in the
 
04:25:23.149 --> 04:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
number of doses right administered on
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
the left side to the percentage of
 
04:25:27.790 --> 04:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
children with a chronic health issue and
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
I can say this much a lot of The Chronic
 
04:25:31.149 --> 04:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
health issues that have exploded are
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
immune or immune mediated issues
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
something as simple as asthma which has
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
exploded over the last few decades is an
 
04:25:39.630 --> 04:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
immune system disregulation that's what
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is right your lungs improperly have
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
an immune reaction in there um and so a
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
lot of these conditions something has
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
gone wrong with the immune system of our
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
children's including neurological issues
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
that are immune mediated um you know you
 
04:25:54.670 --> 04:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
would think the first place you would
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
look is the product given to them dozens
 
04:25:59.309 --> 04:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
of times to modify their immune system
 
04:26:00.990 --> 04:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
they tell you vaccines are powerful they
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
tell you they're effective they tell you
 
04:26:05.469 --> 04:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
have systemic immunity right you inject
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
here and you have immunity in your toes
 
04:26:09.830 --> 04:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
right they have a systemic reaction well
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
um you know what other effects can I
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
have um and so on your immune system and
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
there's lots of studies out there that
 
04:26:19.510 --> 04:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
um can be concerned we talked about the
 
04:26:20.910 --> 04:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
aluminum Aden studies a little bit
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
earlier and there's lots of others um
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
the one thing Public Health authorities
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
have not done is they have not compared
 
04:26:30.790 --> 04:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
vaccinated unvaccinated well they've not
 
04:26:33.030 --> 04:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
published any studies comparing
 
04:26:35.510 --> 04:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and unvaccinated children and
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
it would be easy to do because you can
 
04:26:40.109 --> 04:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
just do it using existing Health
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance data databases you could do it
 
04:26:46.510 --> 04:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
retrospectively that data is there The
 
04:26:49.550 --> 04:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
Institute of medicine in that 2014 I
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
report that was referenced in that uh
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
website that Institute of medicine
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
report would looked at the safety of the
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
entire schedule that's what that report
 
04:27:00.030 --> 04:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
was for they concluded there's no
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
evidence to say it's safe it's not safe
 
04:27:04.510 --> 04:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
they concluded they don't know
 
04:27:06.870 --> 04:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay but one of the things they said is
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the CDC has something called the
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety data link this is a over
 
04:27:14.189 --> 04:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
10 hmos deidentified
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
ICD9 and 10 codes those are the
 
04:27:17.910 --> 04:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
diagnostic codes that you Bill insurance
 
04:27:20.469 --> 04:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
companies with so it Aggregates all that
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
information for over 10 all for over 10
 
04:27:26.309 --> 04:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
million Americans and in that database
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
there are thousands of completely
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated kids zero vaccines and
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
they've even validated their un vac by
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
by doing sampling of their medical
 
04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
records and so
 
04:27:41.269 --> 04:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
forth the CDC could in a minute simply
 
04:27:44.429 --> 04:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
run a compar comparison of all the kids
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
that got one or more shots to the kids
 
04:27:50.750 --> 04:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
that got no shots zero and one or more
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay those would be the two comparative
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
groups and you would say okay what is
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
the rate of neurological harm in this
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
group versus this IM immun asthma this
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
group this group just pick your
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
conditions go down the list just run
 
04:28:05.710 --> 04:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
them all and see what the differential
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
is that study has never been published
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
after I said they could do it in 2014
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
the CDC spent oodles of
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
money publishing a white paper on how
 
04:28:17.550 --> 04:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
they could do it that study and it's on
 
04:28:19.469 --> 04:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
the CDC website Stanley pling was one of
 
04:28:21.469 --> 04:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
the people by the way who it's part of
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
the white paper uh and still we don't
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
have that study if they've done it they
 
04:28:29.070 --> 04:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
haven't published it um
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
but uh the uh School University of
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
Jackson Department of epidemiology did a
 
04:28:37.389 --> 04:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
study small based on
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
surveys uh retrospective epid you know I
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
mean it's uh certainly could be far more
 
04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
robust studies but it's something versus
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
nothing and it showed that vaccinated
 
04:28:50.830 --> 04:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
kids at 30 times the rate of rantis is
 
04:28:52.990 --> 04:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated 3.9 times the rate of
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
allergy ADHD four times autism azema
 
04:28:57.870 --> 04:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
learning disability sorry
 
04:29:00.229 --> 04:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
neurodevelopmental Disorder so this is
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
actually the one of the only few vacs
 
04:29:04.990 --> 04:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
versus unv studies I'm aware of and the
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
findings on it are startling and if the
 
04:29:08.670 --> 04:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
health department can certainly take
 
04:29:10.990 --> 04:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
shots I mean you can take shots at any
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
epidemiological so you can say well you
 
04:29:15.429 --> 04:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
know it's based on Parental recall it's
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
based on surveys is how you know how
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
random is your sampling sure you could
 
04:29:23.309 --> 04:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
do that but um uh you can take shots at
 
04:29:27.870 --> 04:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
it but you you know um you know a lot of
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
credit goes to these scientists who
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
stuck their neck out to do this study
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
without Niah funding and knowing they're
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
going to get Ken for doing it it's
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
incredible they actually did it frankly
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
more incredible it exists in any
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
published literature long story short
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:49.389 --> 04:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
this and in terms of the the the scope
 
04:29:51.750 --> 04:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
of the harm so we've looked at what
 
04:29:53.590 --> 04:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
harms might be caused by vaccines sched
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
by Pharma companies we've looked at the
 
04:29:58.349 --> 04:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
fact that they failed to study them um
 
04:30:00.510 --> 04:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh We've looked at what the some
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
of the evidence that might show what
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
what the health outcomes what the impact
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
might be of this increasing vaccine
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
schedule well how many people are harmed
 
04:30:09.790 --> 04:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
potentially what's you know to get an
 
04:30:12.590 --> 04:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
indication of that a signal we could
 
04:30:15.030 --> 04:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
look at vars and I'm going to 2019 pre
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic and this is the number of of of
 
04:30:20.030 --> 04:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
reports of you know to vars of serious
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
issues death permanent disability
 
04:30:25.149 --> 04:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations emergency office visits
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
and I will point out that back then this
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
was a federal government study conducted
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
by Harvard it found that fewer than 1%
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
of Adverse Events are reported to vs I
 
04:30:35.109 --> 04:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
think it's probably increased since Co
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
because people are more aware of vs now
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
but if you you know this is terrible
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
science by the way what I just did
 
04:30:43.469 --> 04:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
terrible science I just said right now
 
04:30:46.389 --> 04:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
but if if it's 1% okay so let's multiply
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
that by 100 I'm not saying these numbers
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
are that's right I I'm I'm making clear
 
04:30:54.950 --> 04:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is terrible science but this is
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
kind of the best approximation I have I
 
04:30:58.830 --> 04:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
don't somebody's got a better study I'll
 
04:31:02.109 --> 04:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
take it I'm happy to look at that data
 
04:31:04.510 --> 04:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
um gonna now switch over to uh covid
 
04:31:08.399 --> 04:31:09.590 align:start position:0%
um gonna now switch over to uh covid
vaccines

04:31:09.590 --> 04:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
04:31:13.469 --> 04:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
okay so there are two systems
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
and and um that the CDC basically says
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
they rely upon primarily to assess the
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
safety of covid-19 vaccines same systems
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
by the way that they primarily will say
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
well not the same but uh one is vs the
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine adver events reporting system
 
04:31:31.109 --> 04:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
which is co- administered by the CDC and
 
04:31:32.910 --> 04:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
the FDA and the other one is a new
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
system that they rolled out just for go
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
called vsafe okay it's brand new so and
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the studies that CDC
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
publishes they primarily focus on vs and
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
vfe to assert the safety of covid-19
 
04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines and I and I as we go through
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
this um you know uh I've I've took the
 
04:31:54.389 --> 04:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
time to go through all the other
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines so that you're not shocked at
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
the way that the CDC handled covid
 
04:32:02.309 --> 04:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
vaccines you will see that this is a bit
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
of business as usual now starting with
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
theirs the CDC when truth was original
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
to them back in December mber 4th 2020
 
04:32:16.910 --> 04:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that's before 16 days before the
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
first covid vaccine rolled out into
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
American Arms and December
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
20th they
 
04:32:25.630 --> 04:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
published a guide right there's the link
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
to the CDC website on how they were
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
going to analyze Bears data oh there we
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
go science we come up with a plan we
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
design a study plan and then we
 
04:32:37.710 --> 04:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
implement it and we then we look at the
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
results and we take them for what they
 
04:32:41.550 --> 04:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
are because that's science we don't
 
04:32:43.870 --> 04:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
change change Midstream we don't like
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing that's not science
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's the perversion of science okay or
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
maybe well let leave it at that so here
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
it is here is their report on how they
 
04:32:57.109 --> 04:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
were going to analyze vs data let's just
 
04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at it signal detection
 
04:33:00.189 --> 04:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
methods and data analysis I'm going to
 
04:33:02.910 --> 04:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
read it um it's not this it's not the
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
most exciting thing but I I'll go
 
04:33:06.429 --> 04:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
through it quick the analysis for
 
04:33:08.910 --> 04:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines safety signals will
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
focus on identifying deviations from
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary safety data and possibly
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
from other vaccines using
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately analysis and
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
comparisons reporting rates next
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph two main approaches to data
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
mining are here here it comes
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
proportional reporting ratios prr K and
 
04:33:30.750 --> 04:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
empirical basing geometric means so
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
those are two different ways to analyze
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
the data and vars both have published
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
literature suggestion criteria for
 
04:33:36.119 --> 04:33:37.349 align:start position:0%
literature suggestion criteria for
detecting

04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
detecting
 
04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
signals PR will be used as at CDC for
 
04:33:43.150 --> 04:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
potential signal detection empirical
 
04:33:45.070 --> 04:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
basing data mining EB analysis will be
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
performed by FDA okay after initial
 
04:33:49.869 --> 04:33:49.879 align:start position:0%
licensure approval covid-19 vaccine
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
United States initial reports may be too
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
few to allow for data mining immediately
 
04:33:56.189 --> 04:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
as the data matures PR and EB data
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
mining can then be used the data matured
 
04:34:00.109 --> 04:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
very quickly I think too quickly for
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
their liking okay so here it is they
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
said the CDC said they're going to use
 
04:34:09.629 --> 04:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
PR to a signal detect in vs well how are
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
they going to do it on this slide on the
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
left side what they said is that they
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
would consider something a safety signal
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
if there were at least three
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
cases the the uh the chai square was at
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
least four and the pr was at least two
 
04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
okay so if you look at column 1 2 and
 
04:34:31.629 --> 04:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
three it needs to be in the First Column
 
04:34:33.629 --> 04:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
above a three in the second column above
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
a four and the third column above a two
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
to be considered a
 
04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
signal by the cdc's
 
04:34:44.990 --> 04:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
standard for what is a signal in vs well
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
let's see what they found oh and by the
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
way what you're seeing here on the right
 
04:34:53.070 --> 04:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
this chart CDC didn't just hand this
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
over this took a lot of Demands fighting
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
and CDC finally coughed this over long
 
04:35:03.629 --> 04:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
after it had this data and and and
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
demands were being made for it all kinds
 
04:35:07.750 --> 04:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
of I mean we were not the only ones
 
04:35:09.510 --> 04:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
going after lots of folks going after
 
04:35:11.310 --> 04:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
this data and they finally had to cough
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
it Senators newspapers uh and so forth
 
04:35:17.750 --> 04:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
well let's just look at it cerebral
 
04:35:20.830 --> 04:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
thrombosis 194 that's a little more than
 
04:35:25.070 --> 04:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
three cases the chai square is 69.7
 
04:35:27.869 --> 04:35:27.879 align:start position:0%
eight a little more than four and the pr
 
04:35:29.629 --> 04:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
was above two and the pr is really the
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
main thing they focus on anything above
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
a two is a signal they had a 73 for Cal
 
04:35:37.629 --> 04:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
thrombosis look down this list these are
 
04:35:37.639 --> 04:35:38.789 align:start position:0%
thrombosis look down this list these are
all

04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
serious conditions abnormal uterine
 
04:35:42.000 --> 04:35:43.109 align:start position:0%
serious conditions abnormal uterine
bleeding

04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
bleeding
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
30 in fact it's so long that actually I
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
had to make a second page and then it
 
04:35:49.949 --> 04:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
keeps going so this is the second page
 
04:35:52.830 --> 04:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
you can go through this list but these
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
are these are serious
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
issues and the
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
CDC based on the way science should be
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
done is you come up with the design how
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to approach it and you live
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
with the result while the result did not
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
fit the policy CDC a policy organization
 
04:36:15.310 --> 04:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers do not
 
04:36:15.320 --> 04:36:18.189 align:start position:0%
these numbers do not
fit

04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
fit
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
so what did the CDC do about this very
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
very troubling set of numbers and and
 
04:36:24.429 --> 04:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
findings and
 
04:36:27.551 --> 04:36:27.561 align:start position:0%
signals this is a um a letter from the
 
04:36:29.470 --> 04:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
US Senate committee on homeland security
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
and government Affairs which I think
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
Senator Ron Johnson is the head of and
 
04:36:38.709 --> 04:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
he wrote them and he said the J now he
 
04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
used the January
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
2021 uh um criteria which is identical
 
04:36:45.551 --> 04:36:45.561 align:start position:0%
to the one you just saw from December by
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
the way okay I don't know why he used
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
the January one but whatever it doesn't
 
04:36:48.719 --> 04:36:50.150 align:start position:0%
the January one but whatever it doesn't
matter

04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
sop described the types of data mining
 
04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
analysis CDC and FDA conduct to identify
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
potential safety concerns linked to
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines these analyses
 
04:37:01.029 --> 04:37:01.039 align:start position:0%
included PR we just looked at that and
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
EB data mining which is what the FDA is
 
04:37:05.869 --> 04:37:05.879 align:start position:0%
supposed to do in a September 2 20122
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
response to my request CDC director
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
rable inform my office that so here's
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
the head of the CDC walking back the
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
whole PR thing because it doesn't look
 
04:37:17.949 --> 04:37:17.959 align:start position:0%
good what does she say quote CDC and the
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
FDA chose to rely on EB data mining oh
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to use PR now a more
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
robust technique used to analyze
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
disproportional reporting really did it
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
say that in the initial report no rather
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
than PR calculations to mitigate
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
potential false signals given the
 
04:37:37.670 --> 04:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
strength of the EB data mining method
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
CDC and FDA plan to continue relying
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
upon EB data mining moving forward
 
04:37:45.990 --> 04:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
ah PR gone out the window now we're
 
04:37:48.230 --> 04:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to use EB
 
04:37:51.869 --> 04:37:51.879 align:start position:0%
analysis fine let's use EB analysis you
 
04:37:53.230 --> 04:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
know what that looks
 
04:37:56.349 --> 04:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
like exactly don't know you know why the
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
FDA won't give it to us we have sued
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
them now
 
04:38:04.029 --> 04:38:04.039 align:start position:0%
twice we have I'm sorry uh we sued them
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
once uh somebody else sued them as well
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
and uh this is a federal court order
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
which says they can wait another a year
 
04:38:13.390 --> 04:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
and a have to give it to
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
us the federal judge federal court order
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
you can look at these yourselves um the
 
04:38:20.109 --> 04:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
FDA complained that they have they're
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
too busy to produce it um data that's
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
deid to be clear deidentified data that
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
discloses no personal indent file
 
04:38:32.510 --> 04:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
information that is in a spreadsheet
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
that they could literally go disclosed
 
04:38:38.551 --> 04:38:38.561 align:start position:0%
and here's the best part CDC has the
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
data already in their possession the EB
 
04:38:42.269 --> 04:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
mining data
 
04:38:44.390 --> 04:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the FDA has it too I know they
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
already have it they they've admitted
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
they have it to us in federal when we
 
04:38:51.709 --> 04:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
were uh um litigating with the doj on
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
this but um um this court decided they
 
04:39:00.269 --> 04:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
don't have to produce it for now so so
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
let me understand something okay the pr
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
data that you just showed us was from
 
04:39:09.629 --> 04:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
the CDC is that correct yes this is the
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
yes this is their findings okay
 
04:39:14.990 --> 04:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the numbers are off the charts based
 
04:39:19.230 --> 04:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
on their criteria their criteria yes
 
04:39:22.869 --> 04:39:22.879 align:start position:0%
okay but in the FDA which is a separate
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
branch of government that should be
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
independent of the
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
CDC um because one does one thing the
 
04:39:31.629 --> 04:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
other one does another thing they're now
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
going to rely on just they're going to
 
04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
collaborate sounds like because they're
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
both going to come up with the same
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
report based on what they're using is
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
that correct they're no longer going to
 
04:39:45.948 --> 04:39:45.958 align:start position:0%
rely on PR because apparently it's
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
unreliable um and and now they're only
 
04:39:50.310 --> 04:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
going to rely on empirical basing
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
analysis according to the director of
 
04:39:54.830 --> 04:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
the CDC and her letter to the uh uh
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee that I just read to you
 
04:39:59.628 --> 04:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry to keep asking these
 
04:39:59.638 --> 04:40:01.150 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry to keep asking these
questions

04:40:01.150 --> 04:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:40:05.190 --> 04:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
um because I'm I'm concerned obviously
 
04:40:09.390 --> 04:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
um because here I keep hearing safe and
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
effective safe and effective but as I
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
information it really there's there's
 
04:40:17.440 --> 04:40:19.070 align:start position:0%
information it really there's there's
concerns

04:40:19.070 --> 04:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:40:22.948 --> 04:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
um so and now we're trying to push it as
 
04:40:25.150 --> 04:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
part of the childhood vaccine schedule
 
04:40:26.910 --> 04:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
it is on the childhood vaccine schedule
 
04:40:29.150 --> 04:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
it is on the childhood vaccine schedule
 
04:40:32.190 --> 04:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
yes starting at six months two
 
04:40:34.470 --> 04:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
doses six months and seven months first
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
two doses covid-19 vaccine uh
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
now I have a different qu thank you
 
04:40:47.070 --> 04:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair now I have a different
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
question but um just based upon this I
 
04:40:51.230 --> 04:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear so these numbers
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
let's just you know all the yellows that
 
04:40:54.910 --> 04:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
are off the charts are really all based
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
upon EVS which um you know there's been
 
04:41:00.230 --> 04:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
a couple different things that kind of
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
studied vars for a while uh you know
 
04:41:06.990 --> 04:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at probably still you know
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
maybe 1% of the reporting so or you know
 
04:41:14.948 --> 04:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
some people say it's less than 1% but in
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
all actuality and we've had more Vees
 
04:41:21.550 --> 04:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
reporting than ever before for covid-19
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines I just want you to um speak to
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
that and then um so if that's the case
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
just based upon we're we're missing you
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
know over 90% of the population as
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
well yeah I I V's reporting preco no
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
doubt was way in my assessment and
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
Harvard study by the government found it
 
04:41:47.230 --> 04:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
was less than 1% was probably way less
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
1% reporting to vs is no simple task if
 
04:41:52.270 --> 04:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
you've ever tried to
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
fill uh the government does not make it
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
easy to submit a v report you should go
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
try it sometime um it is very
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
complicated um they they don't make it
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
simple at all um most folks who try to
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
submit it will tell you they have to try
 
04:42:06.990 --> 04:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
numerous times it takes him a tremendous
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
amount of time to do it and so really it
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
takes a really motiv clinician and it's
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
and and most reports preo certainly the
 
04:42:18.510 --> 04:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
you know 70% were from clinicians or the
 
04:42:20.270 --> 04:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
Pharma company so you know this whole
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
thing of like random people are
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
submitting stuff it's that's not what
 
04:42:26.230 --> 04:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
most reports are you need a really
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
motivated person to submit um those
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
reports I I will suspect I have no
 
04:42:34.070 --> 04:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
empirical data to show this I've not
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
looked at it but I suspect that the
 
04:42:39.070 --> 04:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
number that for covid vaccines because
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
there was so much attention on this
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
product the uh there was a greater I
 
04:42:44.830 --> 04:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is but I think
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
there's probably more reporting to Vees
 
04:42:51.550 --> 04:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
than there was um for other vaccines
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
historically I I suspect it's you know
 
04:42:56.830 --> 04:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
but even if it's seven times as much you
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
might still be under 1% by the way
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
follow up but I don't know I don't know
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'm speculating thank you madam chair um
 
04:43:06.430 --> 04:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that so what you mentioned is just
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
another piece too and we've heard that
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
our committee's heard it but um I've
 
04:43:13.628 --> 04:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
heard it for the last several years um
 
04:43:18.470 --> 04:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
in regards with uh um nurses doctors
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners are not trained I mean
 
04:43:23.948 --> 04:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
you've got the what the CDC puts out
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
right but there nobody's ever been
 
04:43:27.590 --> 04:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
trained and a lot of people are not even
 
04:43:29.910 --> 04:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
familiar that are in the medical field
 
04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
of of what VES is absolutely most
 
04:43:34.030 --> 04:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
medical professionals in my experience
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
have no idea what vs is never heard of
 
04:43:37.948 --> 04:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
it and understand that under federal law
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
the only obligation to report to vs is
 
04:43:41.708 --> 04:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
is is a
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
is typically the the administrator of
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and only for certain
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
conditions so think about that if you go
 
04:43:50.788 --> 04:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
through one of these drive-throughs
 
04:43:54.750 --> 04:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
you're gone so you go see another doctor
 
04:43:58.030 --> 04:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
that doctor arguably does not have I say
 
04:44:01.750 --> 04:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
arguably because I I'd like
 
04:44:04.150 --> 04:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
to to report it but they're not they're
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
not the administrator of the vaccine so
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
um you know issues that arise that are
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
not literally immediate immediate like
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
immediate anap axis even have you know
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
um the administrator is not there now if
 
04:44:19.708 --> 04:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
you go if you get the vaccine at the
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
hospital at a hospital and you go back
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
to the same Hospital most people don't
 
04:44:25.708 --> 04:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
get vaccines at a hospital um you know
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
then then might be and and you have a
 
04:44:30.110 --> 04:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
condition that's one of the mandatory
 
04:44:31.230 --> 04:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
reporting then you might have a
 
04:44:33.150 --> 04:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporting situation but for
 
04:44:35.708 --> 04:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
the most part most adverse effects
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
there's no you don't encounter a medical
 
04:44:40.990 --> 04:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
professional when you afterwards that
 
04:44:42.670 --> 04:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
that has an obligation to report to vs
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's actually rare in my opinion in my
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
experience follow up sorry um yeah thank
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so what you just said is
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
so important too because in you know and
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
I know it was probably like this in most
 
04:44:56.948 --> 04:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
States but in New Hampshire that roll
 
04:44:59.948 --> 04:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
out was was fast and furious and of
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
course it was you know there were
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
medical professionals that were first
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
but when it was kind of this um you know
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
drive-thru type of environment you had
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
um our our New Hampshire National C was
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
activated and in doing injections and
 
04:45:16.948 --> 04:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
there were reports of where people got
 
04:45:20.350 --> 04:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
slumped over in their car afterward but
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
that that speaks to none of that none of
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
those things were it's not like a
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
computer no none of them were qualified
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't doctors or nurses or
 
04:45:31.470 --> 04:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
anything like that in in administering
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
these um injections so none of that
 
04:45:36.910 --> 04:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
stuff got reported and we had like I
 
04:45:38.788 --> 04:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
said there was at malls and all of these
 
04:45:40.470 --> 04:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
other things I mean what is the
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of people that went to really
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
like whether it be a a doctor or a
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
hospital to have gotten a vaccine during
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
that time I really recall six months of
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
it being this kind of massive in these
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination clinics where these people
 
04:45:59.708 --> 04:45:59.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have ever reported anything
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
well I actually I mean it's bad news for
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
those who got who had issues but great
 
04:46:05.110 --> 04:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
news in terms of answering your question
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
which is I actually have the best and
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
most reliable robust data to answer
 
04:46:10.390 --> 04:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
precisely what percentage of Americans
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
ended up in hospital after covid vaccine
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that's from the vsafe database and
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get to that right after the
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
vs and I'll show that to you I will
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
point out um that these these numbers
 
04:46:21.628 --> 04:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
from vs are considered signal detections
 
04:46:23.070 --> 04:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're just supposed to be
 
04:46:24.628 --> 04:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
signals that that supposed to Merit
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
further investigation but that'll be
 
04:46:28.270 --> 04:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
maybe too many things for them to
 
04:46:29.548 --> 04:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
investigate which is why I don't think
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
they want to do it and um if I would be
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh if I could I don't make a a bold
 
04:46:38.590 --> 04:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
statement is that you know there's
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
really uh for the most part
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
exists um to help affirm vaccine safety
 
04:46:46.030 --> 04:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
never really to find
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
issues they will publish studies saying
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
they looked at vs and they didn't find
 
04:46:52.868 --> 04:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
anything so it doesn't cause that issue
 
04:46:56.110 --> 04:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
but they will never look at vs and say
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
based on vs it does cause an issue they
 
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
tell you it's a signal detection system
 
04:47:04.590 --> 04:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
it can never prove causation but yet but
 
04:47:06.750 --> 04:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
yet they will rely on it to say that a
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine is
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
safe so you it really when you really
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
step back from bears you'll understand
 
04:47:17.708 --> 04:47:17.718 align:start position:0%
it only can prove one thing safety it it
 
04:47:20.628 --> 04:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
can they will once in a while say Well
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
it gave us a signal that we then
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
investigated and found yes it's a
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
problem but they'll never say ver showed
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
us there was a problem but it can be
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
used to show safety um that's the way
 
04:47:34.350 --> 04:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
they use it representative
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
Belgium thank you madam chair
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
um as far as that data goes uh simple
 
04:47:45.548 --> 04:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
question is obviously we don't have the
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh whatever the EB method the other
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
method that was FDA originally was using
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have those numbers I don't like
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
the fact or reason we don't have those
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
numbers but we do have these numbers the
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
prr method so my question on this is is
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
there a history behind the pr method has
 
04:48:04.190 --> 04:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
it previously been validated and
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
utilized in such a manner yes and and
 
04:48:08.910 --> 04:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
actually we can look at the cdc's own
 
04:48:11.390 --> 04:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
words in that regard it says says here
 
04:48:11.400 --> 04:48:12.788 align:start position:0%
words in that regard it says says here
that

04:48:12.788 --> 04:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:15.628 --> 04:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
um it says both have published speaking
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
of PR and EB both have published
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
literature suggestion criteria for
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
detecting signals uh perer use blah blah
 
04:48:25.030 --> 04:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:27.910 --> 04:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
um well it says they both have published
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
literature and they also go on to more
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
validate it but I don't have that part
 
04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
in my slide but yes they both have
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
existing literature and history of being
 
04:48:36.750 --> 04:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
used they're not just made up for the
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of covid perfect thank you
 
04:48:41.440 --> 04:48:43.150 align:start position:0%
purposes of covid perfect thank you
um

04:48:43.150 --> 04:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:47.670 --> 04:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay so uh uh moving on to uh to vfe so
 
04:48:50.430 --> 04:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
we now we've covered vs so Vees didn't
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
look good based on the pr and we don't
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
have the EB and there's probably a
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
reason we don't have it because I'm you
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
know um I'm going to assume it doesn't
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
again align with the policy that they
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
have regarding these
 
04:49:05.548 --> 04:49:05.558 align:start position:0%
products well that brings us to the
 
04:49:07.868 --> 04:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
other safety system and that's called
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
vsafe vsafe
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
was a safety system rolled out
 
04:49:19.948 --> 04:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
specifically to assess the safety of co9
 
04:49:23.590 --> 04:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines okay after Decades of saying vs
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
is their Premier system they kind of
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
abandoned it interestingly it was was
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
interesting to watch it happen and with
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
the December roll out December 2020 they
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
rolled out
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
vsafe vsafe is not like theirs it is not
 
04:49:41.430 --> 04:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
intended for you to just report when you
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
have an issue it's intended for
 
04:49:46.548 --> 04:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
everybody to use and to start using
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
basically right before you get your
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
first shot so you sign up you get your
 
04:49:53.788 --> 04:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
shot and then you get a survey so the
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
idea is to get a um a baseline
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
unconnected to let's call it user bias
 
04:50:04.070 --> 04:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
whereas vs is really just there to
 
04:50:06.510 --> 04:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
report issues vsafe was there to just
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
get a baseline of all
 
04:50:12.750 --> 04:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
users and um they got they have about 10
 
04:50:15.230 --> 04:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
million Americans signed up for vsafe
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
about 9 million of them signed up in the
 
04:50:19.990 --> 04:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
first few months between December and
 
04:50:22.150 --> 04:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
and May and remember this was the period
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
of time in America there were no
 
04:50:25.150 --> 04:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
mandates this is when people were
 
04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
clamoring over each other dances were
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
being done on two vaccines you know
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
there was no uh uh uh nobody who didn't
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
want one was getting one in fact people
 
04:50:35.910 --> 04:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
were getting arrested because they were
 
04:50:37.230 --> 04:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
trying to cut ahead of the line to get
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
him and so these were the the vaccine
 
04:50:42.350 --> 04:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
folks who were really excited about this
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
product they were running out they were
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting the vaccine and and in fact this
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
was part of that excitement was signing
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
up for vsafe this was they felt this
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
part of the civic duty in fact there's a
 
04:50:53.310 --> 04:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
survey that part of V why'd you sign up
 
04:50:54.430 --> 04:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of them said it was part of my
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
civic duty I want them to participate in
 
04:51:00.070 --> 04:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
this so um so it's it's far better than
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
Vees because it has a denominator where
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
they say well Vees we don't know we we
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
have yeah sure 30,000 people said
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
reported death but like I don't know
 
04:51:11.590 --> 04:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
what's out of how many and you know and
 
04:51:13.270 --> 04:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
this many reported this condition but
 
04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
out of how many well for this we have a
 
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
denominator we have 10 million users if
 
04:51:21.788 --> 04:51:21.798 align:start position:0%
a million report an issue that's 10% so
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
way better than veers in that regard and
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
I would argue way better than clinical
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
trial data why how do you know there's
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
an adverse event in a clinical trial you
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
ask the participant they show up at the
 
04:51:36.190 --> 04:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
clinical trial site like Maddie and you
 
04:51:38.030 --> 04:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
say hey I was injured and you know they
 
04:51:39.990 --> 04:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
do an excellent job of writing it down
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
and transmitting it to the FDA I mean
 
04:51:47.510 --> 04:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
just perfect job so you get uh um in in
 
04:51:49.270 --> 04:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
a clinical trial you're getting the data
 
04:51:50.590 --> 04:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
the same way you're getting it from the
 
04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
clinical trial participant but unlike a
 
04:51:55.390 --> 04:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trial where the data goes to
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
the Pharma company the sponsor filtered
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
through them to the FDA and then from
 
04:52:02.990 --> 04:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
there maybe to the public if we sue them
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
in federal court for a year like we had
 
04:52:08.070 --> 04:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
to do to get clinical trial data
 
04:52:10.750 --> 04:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
here you have 10 million folks not
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
30,000 in a clinical trial doing the
 
04:52:16.830 --> 04:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
same thing to a standardized
 
04:52:19.708 --> 04:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
survey and we got access to the data
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
directly took two Federal lawsuits in in
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
two years but we got
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
it okay and I'm going to show you what
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
this data is right now I'm going to walk
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.230 --> 04:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
please good R thank you madam chair just
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
real quick yeah I was going to ask about
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
um what the process was cuz I I remember
 
04:52:43.708 --> 04:52:43.718 align:start position:0%
um I remember the lawsuit the first one
 
04:52:46.270 --> 04:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
and and about having to get this like
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
what was the you know kind of what was
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
the brick wall that you had to go
 
04:52:51.230 --> 04:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
through the vfe data you mean yes yeah
 
04:52:53.548 --> 04:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
how did that just quickly like what was
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
the brick wall yeah oh the Department of
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
Justice said no and then they said no
 
04:53:00.190 --> 04:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
and then they said no like 600 more
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
times eventually they said yes that's
 
04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
kind of the the way those litigations go
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
I mean look the the the the federal
 
04:53:09.030 --> 04:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
government has uh just a little bit of
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
our money and our resources and
 
04:53:11.868 --> 04:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they forget that they
 
04:53:14.270 --> 04:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
serve the public and the people of this
 
04:53:16.270 --> 04:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
country and they view themselves as
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
their own independent entity to be
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
defended and so you know um they they
 
04:53:21.520 --> 04:53:22.350 align:start position:0%
defended and so you know um they they
are

04:53:22.350 --> 04:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:53:24.868 --> 04:53:24.878 align:start position:0%
are typically of the of the view that
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
they'll just wait you out they'll fight
 
04:53:27.590 --> 04:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
you and fight you and you don't have the
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
resources to do it but we're very
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
fortunate because I can the inform and
 
04:53:33.708 --> 04:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
Action Network funds these lawsuits and
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
they fund them and they make sure that
 
04:53:37.788 --> 04:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
we have the resources and the attorneys
 
04:53:39.910 --> 04:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
um to fight these things for years and
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
we do we don't let them
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
go follow up so yeah do you guys
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
um two years and I can't imagine the
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
amount of money to be able to get it so
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
do they are they do they end up having
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
to pay back those legal fees that
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
because they they stonewalled the whole
 
04:53:59.548 --> 04:53:59.558 align:start position:0%
time uh so um so in a freedom
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
information act yes they do have to um
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
if you're successful and you meet the
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
criteria they do have to pay some they
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
do have to pay attorney's fees but you
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
can imagine uh first of all are very
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
high risk cases that most attorneys
 
04:54:14.270 --> 04:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
would not take on Plain to side purely
 
04:54:16.548 --> 04:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
on contingency and two you obviously
 
04:54:19.030 --> 04:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
have to carry the the costs of of your
 
04:54:21.708 --> 04:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
entire team for that entire time um you
 
04:54:24.030 --> 04:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
know until that comes at the end of the
 
04:54:27.868 --> 04:54:27.878 align:start position:0%
day so uh I I you know I would love if
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
every lawyer in the country decided to
 
04:54:30.948 --> 04:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
go after the CDC and FDA for
 
04:54:34.350 --> 04:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
transparency I welcome it please do so I
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful but um uh it's it's
 
04:54:39.670 --> 04:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
not um it will not be a lucrative
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
practice so you know eyes wide open uh
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
and they know that that's why most folks
 
04:54:47.070 --> 04:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
aren't going to do it so um so uh I'm
 
04:54:48.750 --> 04:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to play a short video from the CDC
 
04:54:54.710 --> 04:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.720 --> 04:55:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
all right there it is that's vsafe
 
04:55:30.270 --> 04:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
there's lots of these videos go to
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
YouTube CDC made a bunch of them they
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
got posters everywhere I think they
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
really regretted doing that because you
 
04:55:38.670 --> 04:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
will see very quickly why they think
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
they regretted it
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
vsafe like theirs I think was actually
 
04:55:46.590 --> 04:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
very much intended to be able to just
 
04:55:49.548 --> 04:55:49.558 align:start position:0%
prove safety but since it was new they
 
04:55:51.390 --> 04:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
had I think they kind of messed up so
 
04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
and I'll walk you through that right now
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
let's start with what did vafe gather
 
04:55:58.750 --> 04:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay it gathered two types of
 
04:56:01.750 --> 04:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
information check the box data and then
 
04:56:04.548 --> 04:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
free Tex field data all
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
right I'm sorry this isn't
 
04:56:12.030 --> 04:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
more titillating but so in the check the
 
04:56:14.470 --> 04:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
box data there's two types of check the
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
boox data that it gathered first thing
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
we symptoms it had a list of symptoms
 
04:56:21.190 --> 04:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
you could check if you had those
 
04:56:23.788 --> 04:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
symptoms all right that's the first
 
04:56:25.948 --> 04:56:25.958 align:start position:0%
category check the box data here's the
 
04:56:28.270 --> 04:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
list of the symptoms chills headache
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
joint pains body aches fatigue nausea
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay these are the very symptoms that
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
the CDC tells you are totally normal to
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
have for the first first week after
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination in fact they tell you it's
 
04:56:45.788 --> 04:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
good it's called reactogenicity it shows
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
the vaccinees working it shows you're
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
having an immune reaction so having
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
these symptoms having these symptoms
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
means the vaccine is creating immunity
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
in your body and it's expected to happen
 
04:56:57.390 --> 04:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
at a high rate now they don't want to
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
have you don't want to have like grade
 
04:57:00.990 --> 04:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
three or four too many people but they
 
04:57:03.030 --> 04:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
want if it's fine if it's happens in
 
04:57:06.510 --> 04:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
grade one or two to most folks okay and
 
04:57:08.590 --> 04:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
when you look at this
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
list you might notice there's a few
 
04:57:10.680 --> 04:57:12.910 align:start position:0%
list you might notice there's a few
things

04:57:12.910 --> 04:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
missing how about heart how about chest
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
pain from our card
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
pericarditis how about neuropathy right
 
04:57:22.590 --> 04:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
how about just tingling in your
 
04:57:25.788 --> 04:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
extremities right how about the symptoms
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
at least of the things how about transer
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
my life how about GBS or at least the
 
04:57:32.110 --> 04:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
symptoms of those conditions you might
 
04:57:35.070 --> 04:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
say well maybe they didn't know the
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine could cause those issues well
 
04:57:39.548 --> 04:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
let's take a look and before I jump to
 
04:57:41.110 --> 04:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
do that I just want to make sure you
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
understand that what they did ask was
 
04:57:44.480 --> 04:57:45.948 align:start position:0%
understand that what they did ask was
totally

04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
totally
 
04:57:48.270 --> 04:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
useless this data that they collected
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
for symptoms for the and they only
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
collected for the first week after each
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
shot that's it was useless here is who
 
04:57:57.310 --> 04:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
was the head of the cdc's immunization
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
office he said vve just not it's just
 
04:58:02.910 --> 04:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
not designed to directly monitor
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
specific Adverse Events outside of
 
04:58:06.830 --> 04:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
reactogenic Adverse Events and you can
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
read that there's a a link there to this
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
whole email exchange where basically
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
they admit like this stuff's pointless
 
04:58:16.350 --> 04:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
to gather and in fact when you look at
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
the studies they publish most of these
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
conditions 40 50 60 70% of people
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
reported them so what was the point of
 
04:58:26.830 --> 04:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
gathering them there really was no
 
04:58:26.840 --> 04:58:28.910 align:start position:0%
gathering them there really was no
point

04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay here is a CDC presentation to their
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine committee from October of
 
04:58:39.150 --> 04:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
2020 take a look at what they suspected
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
the vaccine can cause
 
04:58:42.590 --> 04:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
this is the preliminary list of their's
 
04:58:44.590 --> 04:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events of special interest this
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
is the CDC in the v in their own vacine
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
asip advisory Community anization
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
practices their own slide and what did
 
04:58:55.910 --> 04:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
they say they suspected the co vaccinees
 
04:58:59.548 --> 04:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
might do oh gomber syndrome seizures
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
Strokes narcolepsy anaphylaxis acute Mar
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
heart attacks myocarditis pericarditis
 
04:59:08.670 --> 04:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
thrombocytopenia go down the list the
 
04:59:10.990 --> 04:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
very same
 
04:59:13.788 --> 04:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
issues we saw the vaccine end up
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
causing did they put these conditions
 
04:59:17.320 --> 04:59:18.830 align:start position:0%
causing did they put these conditions
here

04:59:18.830 --> 04:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
no but they knew about them do you want
 
04:59:23.390 --> 04:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
to see something even more incredible
 
04:59:23.400 --> 04:59:24.590 align:start position:0%
to see something even more incredible
you

04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:59:28.390 --> 04:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
ready this is the vsafe protocol from
 
04:59:31.110 --> 04:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
November 19220 remember the vaccine
 
04:59:33.788 --> 04:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
didn't roll out to December 2020 this is
 
04:59:36.750 --> 04:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
the last page of their protocol that
 
04:59:40.150 --> 04:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
they used to design vsafe
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is their Adverse Events of special
 
04:59:45.070 --> 04:59:45.080 align:start position:0%
interest pre-specified medical
 
04:59:47.470 --> 04:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
conditions this is in their own design
 
04:59:50.270 --> 04:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
documents for vsafe look at the
 
04:59:52.350 --> 04:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
conditions they
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
listed the same ones again
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis blood
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
clotting GBS go down the list the very
 
05:00:06.270 --> 05:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
same issues that we saw Americans around
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
this country suffering but again so here
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
it is is in the vsafe protocol I just oh
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
I you won't see my screen if I pull it
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
up will you okay it doesn't matter you
 
05:00:19.430 --> 05:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
can the link is right there and you can
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
pull it up the whole thing but the the
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
the important point is that they knew
 
05:00:25.040 --> 05:00:26.030 align:start position:0%
the important point is that they knew
these

05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:00:28.590 --> 05:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
conditions could be an issue and they
 
05:00:30.070 --> 05:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
call them Adverse Events of special
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
interest pre-specified medical
 
05:00:35.230 --> 05:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
conditions but did they end up on this
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
list no did the symptoms of these
 
05:00:40.830 --> 05:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
conditions end up this no in fact they
 
05:00:44.868 --> 05:00:44.878 align:start position:0%
just left that list with the things that
 
05:00:46.430 --> 05:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
I mean were pretty much pointless you
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
know it's really
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
hard to prove like men's Rea it's hard
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
to prove like a a a a bad state of mind
 
05:01:00.190 --> 05:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
like a premeditated bad conduct to me
 
05:01:04.110 --> 05:01:04.120 align:start position:0%
this list they had this they identified
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
them they said these were of concern and
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
they left them off at least the symptoms
 
05:01:10.510 --> 05:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
of these from their there lists of
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
symptoms in vfe to me that's
 
05:01:15.030 --> 05:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
premeditated potential that's proof of
 
05:01:18.470 --> 05:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
premeditated conduct yes represent Penza
 
05:01:20.390 --> 05:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair a quick
 
05:01:23.430 --> 05:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
question about um when people were
 
05:01:25.230 --> 05:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
filling that out you had said that it
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
was one week so how did that symptoms
 
05:01:30.430 --> 05:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let's say for example I signed
 
05:01:33.788 --> 05:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
up yes and um I I filled it out
 
05:01:36.750 --> 05:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
initially were if I wanted to go back
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
and give other information was I cut off
 
05:01:40.868 --> 05:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
from that
 
05:01:43.830 --> 05:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
um once you submitted you would you
 
05:01:46.270 --> 05:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
would have to do it in the next reports
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
so um it was every day for seven days
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
including the symptoms and then the
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
other stuff I'm about to show you and
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
then once a week up to six weeks and
 
05:01:56.190 --> 05:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
then at 3 six and 12
 
05:01:58.510 --> 05:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
months after each
 
05:02:01.390 --> 05:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
dose okay thank you okay so that was the
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
first category of check the box data I
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
don't know why they bothered collecting
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
it and all the studies that they publish
 
05:02:08.070 --> 05:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
show those rates were crazy high and
 
05:02:11.628 --> 05:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
they don't care second category data so
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
here it is this is the only other check
 
05:02:15.910 --> 05:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
the box data that they gathered it was
 
05:02:17.628 --> 05:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
three things at the top there were you
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
unable to work were you unable to do
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
your normal daily activity or did you
 
05:02:25.470 --> 05:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
get Med did you go get uh care from a
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
doctor or other healthc care
 
05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
professional if you checked that you
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
needed Medical Care it then would open
 
05:02:31.470 --> 05:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
up that other list of options that you
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
can see on your screen did you need tah
 
05:02:36.110 --> 05:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
Health outpa Urgent Care emergency room
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
or hospitalization and then you could
 
05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
check those Okay so remember this system
 
05:02:42.350 --> 05:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
is called vsafe it's here to assess
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
safety so presumably this is where they
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
were going to assess safety where else
 
05:02:49.310 --> 05:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
would they assess it right so I assume
 
05:02:51.070 --> 05:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
then and the most concerning one of
 
05:02:52.990 --> 05:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
these is seeking medical care so you
 
05:02:54.310 --> 05:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
would assume there was a number there
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
was a level at which they said okay if
 
05:02:58.548 --> 05:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
we hit that number problem with the
 
05:03:00.150 --> 05:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
product will pull it so one of a
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
thousand people say Medical Care One in
 
05:03:04.030 --> 05:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
100 one in 50 one I don't know what that
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
number is but you would assume there's a
 
05:03:07.390 --> 05:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
number I don't think there was a number
 
05:03:11.430 --> 05:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll show you why okay
 
05:03:13.708 --> 05:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
the CDC while I was fighting with them
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
for two years to get this data this
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
check the box data from those 10 million
 
05:03:20.910 --> 05:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
users they published over 40
 
05:03:23.708 --> 05:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
studies they said covid-19 vaccines are
 
05:03:25.310 --> 05:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
safe these are the body of literature
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
that the scientific Community says they
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
rely upon and when they did that in
 
05:03:31.150 --> 05:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
every one of those studies this is what
 
05:03:35.590 --> 05:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
they did they only reported the number
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
seeking emergency V uh uh seeking
 
05:03:40.150 --> 05:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
medical care for the first week after
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
the shot that's it that's it just for
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the first seven days even though they
 
05:03:46.030 --> 05:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
know even though they had the data for
 
05:03:47.910 --> 05:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
two week third week fourth week fifth
 
05:03:49.628 --> 05:03:49.638 align:start position:0%
week sixth week why collect the data if
 
05:03:52.110 --> 05:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to report it obviously
 
05:03:54.270 --> 05:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
they did it for they did it because they
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
know Co injuries vaccine injuries can
 
05:03:59.628 --> 05:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
occur with weeks after vaccination just
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
like we talked about earlier for example
 
05:04:02.430 --> 05:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have an immune system
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
disregulation to a vaccine it often
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
takes a while for your immune system to
 
05:04:08.510 --> 05:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
have that issue just like it takes it a
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
while for it to develop you know uh uh
 
05:04:12.670 --> 05:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
immunity that's intended to be created
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
by the vaccine okay and and if you look
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
at vaccine Court they know that issues
 
05:04:19.230 --> 05:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
from vaccines arise well after week all
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
the time known issues accepted issues
 
05:04:23.868 --> 05:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
but yet they only reported the first
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
week like in this study five to 11 year
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
olds they say they reported that
 
05:04:32.830 --> 05:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
1.2% needed medical care after dose one
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
and 1.1% by the way I don't know why
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's comforting that's one in 100 kids
 
05:04:41.310 --> 05:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
who needed Medical Care to the shot but
 
05:04:43.470 --> 05:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
but apparently they thought that was
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay here's the list of all the 40
 
05:04:48.390 --> 05:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
studies each of those are hyperlink you
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
get these slides you can go and look at
 
05:04:51.788 --> 05:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
every single one of them they're all
 
05:04:54.510 --> 05:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
there here's the deal these are the two
 
05:04:56.030 --> 05:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuits we had to bring to get that
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
check the box data and when we finally
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
got the data what it showed was that
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
7.7% of V safe users needed Medical Care
 
05:05:09.350 --> 05:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
7.7% and on average two to three times
 
05:05:09.360 --> 05:05:10.470 align:start position:0%
7.7% and on average two to three times
each

05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
each
 
05:05:12.430 --> 05:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
okay and three out of four of those
 
05:05:15.510 --> 05:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
instances were Urgent Care Emergency REM
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalization that's what it showed
 
05:05:20.270 --> 05:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
that is what the CDC no doubt no doubt
 
05:05:22.548 --> 05:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
did not want to disclose from the public
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
in the first six weeks was 4.2% remember
 
05:05:27.150 --> 05:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
these were the vaccine enthusiasts these
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
10 million Americans the last place
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
these folks I think wanted to go was to
 
05:05:32.590 --> 05:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
a hospital they didn't want to leave
 
05:05:34.670 --> 05:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
their home I think typically they wanted
 
05:05:36.270 --> 05:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
to wear their mask stay at home they
 
05:05:38.830 --> 05:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
were worried about covid to get them to
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
go to an urgent care emergency room or
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
or or hospitalized they probably had
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
something real serious and to and and
 
05:05:47.230 --> 05:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
that they went on average two to three
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
times meaning there were about 700
 
05:05:51.830 --> 05:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
something thousand in Unique Individuals
 
05:05:54.628 --> 05:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
sought medical care but there were 2 one
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
or two million instances of seeking
 
05:05:59.628 --> 05:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
medical care right you don't go back to
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
the doctor hospital two to three times
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
because you have something that's not
 
05:06:08.350 --> 05:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
very concerning and separately another
 
05:06:10.750 --> 05:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
25% who did not report needing Medical
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
Care reported missing school or work or
 
05:06:15.548 --> 05:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
being unable to perform normally daily
 
05:06:18.030 --> 05:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
activities that brings us to 32% of
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
folks were adversely affected remember
 
05:06:21.390 --> 05:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
they said the military has to get this
 
05:06:22.350 --> 05:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
so we have
 
05:06:24.990 --> 05:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
Readiness covid did not affect
 
05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
individuals at that rate and disable
 
05:06:29.310 --> 05:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
them from school or work performing
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
normal daily activities let alone send
 
05:06:34.350 --> 05:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
7.7% of people to the hospital okay two
 
05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
to three times on average right there is
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
the link to um this link you can use to
 
05:06:43.628 --> 05:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
go to um to do to look at this data
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
yourself I can has done an incredible
 
05:06:49.110 --> 05:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
job of uh taking all this data and
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
putting it on the uh on their website um
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
it's right here we can just take a quick
 
05:06:56.390 --> 05:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
look at it anybody in the public can do
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
this you can go to iand decide.org back
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
v-safe ddata it's taking a minute to
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
load because I guess I'm tethering for
 
05:07:07.230 --> 05:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
my phone um but on this you can um it's
 
05:07:09.948 --> 05:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
a is all of the data it's got the raw
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
data there too and it also has a
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
dashboard where you can manipulate the
 
05:07:15.390 --> 05:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
data while that's loading um I'll just
 
05:07:16.910 --> 05:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
tell you one or two other things about
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
this so after we broke this you know and
 
05:07:22.030 --> 05:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
I can broke this and um I had the
 
05:07:23.310 --> 05:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go on national news and
 
05:07:26.270 --> 05:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
discuss this data actually Reuters
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
reached out to me and said the CDC had
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
contact had spoken to the CDC about it
 
05:07:34.830 --> 05:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
and they said well the 7.7% is something
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
or other and I
 
05:07:38.948 --> 05:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
said I'm going to put it in writing the
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
7. % 100% is accurate and here's the raw
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
data and the CDC had to back off in fact
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
I have a whole substack I wrote just
 
05:07:48.910 --> 05:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
about that it was incredible because
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
they were hoping Reuters would just say
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's misinformation without actually
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
verifying it it was actually incredible
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
to watch it in action so here it is you
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
can see right here Health impacts here's
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
the 10 million individuals you could see
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
it on your screen and if we limit it
 
05:08:05.788 --> 05:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
just to uh required medical care you
 
05:08:08.110 --> 05:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
could see again 782,000 Unique
 
05:08:10.868 --> 05:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
Individuals and 2.1 million Total Health
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
impacts and you can break it down by
 
05:08:15.470 --> 05:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine by by anything you want okay so
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
I'll leave folks to go through that the
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
important point is um the important
 
05:08:23.910 --> 05:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
point is that again that
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily even that the vaccine
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
caused harm but the fact that the
 
05:08:32.190 --> 05:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
CDC they they did not they try to hide
 
05:08:34.548 --> 05:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
it from the public um and when they
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
finally got caught with it and had to
 
05:08:39.548 --> 05:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
admit it uh the number is uh is is
 
05:08:41.670 --> 05:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
really concerning I've just told you
 
05:08:42.990 --> 05:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
about Reuters There's the link to the
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
article where you could look at that so
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
just to put a fine point in this if
 
05:08:49.190 --> 05:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking for the data back to your
 
05:08:51.110 --> 05:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
question earlier what percentage of
 
05:08:52.590 --> 05:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
Americans who got a covid vaccine ended
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
up in the
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
hospital that is the best data you're
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
ever gonna get on that question the best
 
05:09:04.110 --> 05:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
data it's not 30,000 people like in aone
 
05:09:06.430 --> 05:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
TR it's 10 million they're all filling
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
out a standardized form they are a
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
cross-section of America Americans there
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
folks who came went out before mandates
 
05:09:13.590 --> 05:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
there folks who were Enthusiast to get
 
05:09:16.350 --> 05:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
the vaccine anything anything that
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
number is under reported based on those
 
05:09:21.190 --> 05:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
confounders and so that's really your
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
best indication of what impact this
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine has I'll point out one other
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
interesting data point from this data
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
and I actually pointed this out to
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
Reuters and I think the CDC didn't know
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
what to do with it but this is for
 
05:09:34.910 --> 05:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
example when you do some data mining and
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
this is what the CDC should have been
 
05:09:37.590 --> 05:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
doing with
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
vate this is the number of Adverse
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
Events that were
 
05:09:45.030 --> 05:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
reported this is the number of excuse me
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh of of individuals three and older uh
 
05:09:50.430 --> 05:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
from the first dose of the fiser vaccine
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
that reported needing Medical Care okay
 
05:09:53.788 --> 05:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
this is not cumulative what you're
 
05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
looking at on your screen okay and
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
anybody can go and download the vsafe
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
data from I website and do exactly this
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
between day 1 and
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
7.32% of those who got the fiser vaccine
 
05:10:07.310 --> 05:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
reported need going to the hospital or
 
05:10:09.310 --> 05:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
needing medical care or emergency orer
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
carel Health
 
05:10:15.510 --> 05:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
32% then in the second week after the C
 
05:10:18.110 --> 05:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
after the first dose
 
05:10:20.910 --> 05:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
67% of vsafe users reported needing
 
05:10:23.590 --> 05:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
Medical Care again not cumulative it's
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
not cumulative with the first week look
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
at what happens in the third week look
 
05:10:29.948 --> 05:10:29.958 align:start position:0%
at the fourth week look at the fifth and
 
05:10:32.110 --> 05:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
look at the sixth week you have an
 
05:10:35.350 --> 05:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
increasing Crescendo of individuals who
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
reporting needing medical care after the
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine reporting only the first week is
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
incredibly misleading but that is what
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
the CDC did in over 40 studies and that
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
data point that you're looking on your
 
05:10:53.390 --> 05:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
screen that should have been terribly
 
05:10:55.150 --> 05:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
concerning and
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
investigated but I don't think that was
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
the point of eafe I think the point of
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
vsafe was to just confirm safety
 
05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately which shouldn't be
 
05:11:04.750 --> 05:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
surprising because the CDC is not a
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
medical organization they're they're a
 
05:11:08.430 --> 05:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
policy organiz they're an agency they
 
05:11:10.030 --> 05:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
have a policy they set the policy just
 
05:11:12.190 --> 05:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
like any agency and then they make sure
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
everything conforms to that
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
policy okay question that's V safe um
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes please represent
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
Penza uh I just had a question
 
05:11:25.230 --> 05:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
concerning the the vsafe um and I don't
 
05:11:27.070 --> 05:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
know if you I guess when you got all the
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
data dump you might have it so you know
 
05:11:31.270 --> 05:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
how like let's say somebody signs up for
 
05:11:33.548 --> 05:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
something they might have just reported
 
05:11:35.470 --> 05:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
within the first week and then they drop
 
05:11:37.510 --> 05:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
off and they didn't like do you know
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
like how Okay so 10 million signed up
 
05:11:42.788 --> 05:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
right how many really went all the way
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
through cuz that kind of speaks to this
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
as well so if 10 million signed up and
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
then they dropped off from Day 36 to 42
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
right then what that that percentage of
 
05:11:54.548 --> 05:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
people that were affected by things
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
obviously goes a lot higher so you mean
 
05:11:58.190 --> 05:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
like you mean like those who
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
died correct right yeah and that was one
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the uh limitations uh the CDC figured
 
05:12:06.430 --> 05:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
out in there in this bsafe protocol
 
05:12:09.548 --> 05:12:09.558 align:start position:0%
documents obviously yes um yes so in the
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
data set you can you can I mean if you
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
do if you crunch the numbers you can see
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
that obviously there was um some
 
05:12:20.830 --> 05:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
trailing off but if anything that um
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
either those it could be because they're
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
not interested or because they were too
 
05:12:27.708 --> 05:12:27.718 align:start position:0%
sick to report or because they passed um
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
but if anything that can only reduce the
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
percentage not increase because remember
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
we have a denominator the denominator
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
stays 10
 
05:12:39.310 --> 05:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
million okay I'll give you an example we
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
the 7.7% figure even though we know for
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
example about 500 something thousand of
 
05:12:48.548 --> 05:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
those folks signed up for be safe never
 
05:12:51.470 --> 05:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
filled out a single survey okay they
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
never filled out one survey so I could
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
we could remove them and the 7.7 number
 
05:13:00.190 --> 05:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
would go up but I don't want to include
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
any and and it would be valid
 
05:13:05.390 --> 05:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
statistically to do that but we chose
 
05:13:05.400 --> 05:13:06.628 align:start position:0%
statistically to do that but we chose
the

05:13:06.628 --> 05:13:06.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
most the most conservative number that
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
required virtually no explanation
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
including the one I just gave you on
 
05:13:16.350 --> 05:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
taking those folks out because we knew
 
05:13:18.350 --> 05:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
that that reuter CNN all of them would
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
attack this data attack the find even
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
though it's right there in black and
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
white in the data set you um so that it
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
would be super easy to explain that is
 
05:13:29.548 --> 05:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
the number of unique users who were
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
signed up 700 something thousand divided
 
05:13:34.948 --> 05:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
by the total number of users without
 
05:13:37.390 --> 05:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
backing up if we did what you said if we
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
backed out for example the 500,000 and
 
05:13:41.510 --> 05:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
then we did it yes the number would go
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
up um so I'm just looking at this and so
 
05:13:48.270 --> 05:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
to me it's saying somewhere between 16
 
05:13:48.280 --> 05:13:49.868 align:start position:0%
to me it's saying somewhere between 16
and

05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:53.948 --> 05:13:53.958 align:start position:0%
177% of the people within the first 42
 
05:13:56.470 --> 05:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
days had to seek a med Medical Care is
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
that correct remember uh it could be the
 
05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
same person okay so they they right so
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
it could be the same person in week one
 
05:14:06.670 --> 05:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
and then week five and seven which is is
 
05:14:08.270 --> 05:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
is frankly more concerning I would I
 
05:14:11.150 --> 05:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
would be more fored if this was
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
everybody saw Medical Care one time and
 
05:14:15.310 --> 05:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
that was it the fact that I there'll be
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
folks potentially saw it seven eight
 
05:14:19.070 --> 05:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
times you know one of the folks that
 
05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
we've we know of um and I don't have her
 
05:14:24.548 --> 05:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
it's too bad I don't have it here um but
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
um uh she she gave me permission to
 
05:14:28.470 --> 05:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
disclose it I wrote a substack about it
 
05:14:31.230 --> 05:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
and I I put it out she shared her vsafe
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
entries she was a professor who went and
 
05:14:35.708 --> 05:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
got the covid vaccine to teach a lesson
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
to her students on civic duty to go to
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
get a covid vaccine and after she got it
 
05:14:43.310 --> 05:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
she had a Cascade of horrifying medical
 
05:14:46.270 --> 05:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
conditions and her Emil her her her
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
submissions on vsafe are please help me
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
please help me she and she does that
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
over and over and over her six month
 
05:14:54.628 --> 05:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
submission still nobody's reached out to
 
05:14:56.590 --> 05:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
me nobody's contacting me help me she
 
05:14:58.230 --> 05:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
can't drive she can't engage in in
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
normal functions I mean she was in a uh
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
um really she had really serious Adverse
 
05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
Events so um she's an example of
 
05:15:11.548 --> 05:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
somebody who saw Medical Care over and
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
over again and would have potentially
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
been in a number of
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
these so so I understand it could be a a
 
05:15:23.310 --> 05:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
person doing it one or more times well
 
05:15:24.590 --> 05:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're reporting the
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
same Hospital incidents more than once
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
it means right right that I understand
 
05:15:32.350 --> 05:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
but I guess and I know you probably
 
05:15:34.270 --> 05:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
can't answer this
 
05:15:37.470 --> 05:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
question and I go I I guess I'm looking
 
05:15:39.868 --> 05:15:39.878 align:start position:0%
at the childhood vaccine and everything
 
05:15:43.868 --> 05:15:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:46.510 --> 05:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
point do we
 
05:15:49.948 --> 05:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
say this is affecting public health and
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
if we're
 
05:15:55.510 --> 05:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
in supposed to be looking out for public
 
05:15:59.470 --> 05:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
we um even say that these are safe and
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
effective I don't know if this is the
 
05:16:08.190 --> 05:16:08.200 align:start position:0%
answer you're looking for but to me with
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
this SC
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
screams is is exactly why civil
 
05:16:15.948 --> 05:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
liberties individual rights should never
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
be contingent on the opinions policies
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%

05:16:27.150 --> 05:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
authority ever they should persuade on
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
the merits and if they can't that should
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
be the end of discussion that's the idea
 
05:16:32.548 --> 05:16:32.558 align:start position:0%

chair
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
um now of of course most of this was
 
05:16:42.548 --> 05:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but it um you know being very
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
involved when kind of the whole Co thing
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
was going on and the vaccine rollouts
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
there was so many people that um that I
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
talked to that missed work and I'm
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
talking about people in the medical
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
profession as well as um folks that were
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
you know being pressured into it whether
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
it be from family members and just in
 
05:17:07.990 --> 05:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
your time in research um you know the
 
05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
whole point was to get back right and
 
05:17:13.628 --> 05:17:13.638 align:start position:0%
and I think that that was so striking to
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
me and I and they asked that question so
 
05:17:19.390 --> 05:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
um I just thought that that was you know
 
05:17:21.548 --> 05:17:21.558 align:start position:0%
I can go on there and pull like specific
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
data about like people how they missed
 
05:17:27.948 --> 05:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
work there were some friends of ours um
 
05:17:30.270 --> 05:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
that were very sick
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
like people that had had covid and still
 
05:17:35.868 --> 05:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
ended up getting uh an injection and
 
05:17:38.310 --> 05:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
they missed work for a long time some
 
05:17:41.310 --> 05:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
probably that have not gone back so you
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
know just in your research did you see
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
that as well oh yeah again the vsafe
 
05:17:48.470 --> 05:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
data is going to be your the absolute
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
best data to show what that number is
 
05:17:54.788 --> 05:17:54.798 align:start position:0%
25 putting aside remember had those
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
three categories where you could check
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to go back to it so you
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
could check you're unable to work or or
 
05:18:02.910 --> 05:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
School unable to do your normal
 
05:18:04.548 --> 05:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
activities or use saw Medical
 
05:18:07.470 --> 05:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
Care 25% of
 
05:18:11.070 --> 05:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
people who there were 25% of the vsafe
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
participants checked being unable to
 
05:18:14.990 --> 05:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
work or perform normal activities who
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
didn't check needing medical care so
 
05:18:17.520 --> 05:18:18.708 align:start position:0%
didn't check needing medical care so
that's

05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:18:21.070 --> 05:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
25% add in obviously if you need medical
 
05:18:22.990 --> 05:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
care you're also not able to do that add
 
05:18:25.470 --> 05:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
in the 7.7
 
05:18:29.788 --> 05:18:29.798 align:start position:0%
32% of individuals were needed medical
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
care or unable to for normal activities
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
or M school or work 32% that is what the
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
vsafe data shows and and again you know
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
uh nobody needs to take my word for it
 
05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's all right there on that web page
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
all the raw data as well as this uh
 
05:18:49.110 --> 05:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
incredible uh dashboard where you can
 
05:18:51.430 --> 05:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
run it 32% school work unable to per
 
05:18:53.948 --> 05:18:53.958 align:start position:0%
Noble activities so yeah that's going to
 
05:18:55.510 --> 05:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
be your best indication and yes you're
 
05:18:57.628 --> 05:18:57.638 align:start position:0%
exactly right the idea was you know to
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
get everybody back to work or to slow
 
05:19:01.868 --> 05:19:01.878 align:start position:0%
the spread or U but this product had um
 
05:19:03.430 --> 05:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of what they would call
 
05:19:05.788 --> 05:19:05.798 align:start position:0%
reactogenicity and potential issues of
 
05:19:07.230 --> 05:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
course part of the thing that the the
 
05:19:09.830 --> 05:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the federal authorities would do is they
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
they would often look at a lot of things
 
05:19:15.510 --> 05:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
if I can use that term with regards to
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine only after the second two
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
weeks after the second dose so all that
 
05:19:24.190 --> 05:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
stuff again if I can use that term
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
between the first dose the second dose
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
and two weeks after the second dose just
 
05:19:30.390 --> 05:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
kind of fell into this like nether
 
05:19:32.430 --> 05:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
Netherland you could see it in the vsafe
 
05:19:35.190 --> 05:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
data very clearly that they did not want
 
05:19:36.910 --> 05:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
the public to see and fought vigorously
 
05:19:38.948 --> 05:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
to to hide
 
05:19:38.958 --> 05:19:41.030 align:start position:0%
to to hide
representative

05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair this is uh
 
05:19:46.990 --> 05:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
this has been some difficult testimony
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
learning about all of this I didn't even
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
really know anything about vsafe until
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
today um as some of the people here have
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
known as I've as I've divulged at least
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
in part before I received a single dose
 
05:20:03.788 --> 05:20:03.798 align:start position:0%
of fiser in April of 21 within about 48
 
05:20:05.628 --> 05:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
hours I was unwell enough to seek Urgent
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
Care within a week I'd followed up with
 
05:20:09.310 --> 05:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
my primary Within another week after
 
05:20:11.948 --> 05:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
that roughly neurology it took almost
 
05:20:14.430 --> 05:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
four weeks before I was finally
 
05:20:18.190 --> 05:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalized um so obviously I
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
have that experience that you're seeing
 
05:20:22.470 --> 05:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
right here on this
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
slide but my question is actually I'm
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
not even sure you have this information
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
but it would be interesting to
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
know do we have any
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
indication on what date did the federal
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
government through CDC FDA or anyone
 
05:20:43.390 --> 05:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
else know that the data exceeded a
 
05:20:45.628 --> 05:20:45.638 align:start position:0%
safety signal for the very first time
 
05:20:45.638 --> 05:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
safety signal for the very first time
for

05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:20:50.430 --> 05:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
anything I don't know the precise date
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
but I would suspect it was very early
 
05:20:53.280 --> 05:20:54.110 align:start position:0%
but I would suspect it was very early
for

05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:20:57.708 --> 05:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
prr I mean that that's given the pace
 
05:20:59.430 --> 05:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the number of errs reports that
 
05:21:01.670 --> 05:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
signal I I wouldn't be surprised if they
 
05:21:04.868 --> 05:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
knew it within weeks of the roll out uh
 
05:21:07.548 --> 05:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
in terms of vsafe again I don't think it
 
05:21:12.030 --> 05:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
your 10 million us you had it
 
05:21:14.990 --> 05:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh by you know let's just call two to
 
05:21:16.830 --> 05:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
three months there's it's hard for me to
 
05:21:18.190 --> 05:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
imagine they didn't have this data in
 
05:21:20.590 --> 05:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
hand and
 
05:21:23.708 --> 05:21:23.718 align:start position:0%
analyzed um I'd like to just follow up
 
05:21:26.830 --> 05:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
on something we had T touched on earlier
 
05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
based on what represent belter just
 
05:21:28.280 --> 05:21:29.868 align:start position:0%
based on what represent belter just
spoke

05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
05:21:34.750 --> 05:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
about when we're talking about this data
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
and when did they know it would seem to
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
me that they know knew pretty early on
 
05:21:44.548 --> 05:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
based on their November 2020 list of
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
things that they omitted from the vsafe
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
form of potential side effects um that
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
these could be possible
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
issues um or there would have been no
 
05:22:01.470 --> 05:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
reason to remove them um I'm just
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts yeah the the whole reason that
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
this list exists is because the I mean
 
05:22:14.270 --> 05:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's the title Adverse Events of
 
05:22:16.750 --> 05:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
special interest pre-specified medical
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
you know precepts and medical conditions
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
I mean this is their list this is this
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
is the cdc's OWN protocol for Designing
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
vsafe I mean I I don't know if it could
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
get any clearer in terms of then
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
identifying what the covid vaccine could
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
what harms it could cause it's right
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
there on this list in their own uh
 
05:22:40.390 --> 05:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
design document for V safe um you know
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
and and and it follows on to this
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
October list that they had and there are
 
05:22:48.270 --> 05:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
other you know I mean I un there I mean
 
05:22:49.510 --> 05:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you guys want me here for days I
 
05:22:51.868 --> 05:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
don't know but there there there are
 
05:22:53.230 --> 05:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
there are numerous there are numerous
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
studies that preceded this presentation
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that support why the CDC listed
 
05:23:01.390 --> 05:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
these that you can look at um you know
 
05:23:03.868 --> 05:23:03.878 align:start position:0%
they were well there it is right in
 
05:23:06.190 --> 05:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
front of you clearly aware these were
 
05:23:07.510 --> 05:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
conditions of special interest that the
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines could cause
 
05:23:12.910 --> 05:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
but yet you know the only place in vsafe
 
05:23:15.548 --> 05:23:15.558 align:start position:0%
that you could record those specific
 
05:23:17.868 --> 05:23:17.878 align:start position:0%
harms was in a free Tex field that they
 
05:23:21.070 --> 05:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
limited 250 characters and they fought
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
like heck to not redisclose that and I
 
05:23:25.548 --> 05:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we actually just
 
05:23:26.990 --> 05:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
prevailed in a
 
05:23:30.030 --> 05:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh two two three months ago we
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
finally got a judge I mean separate
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuit than the check the box data they
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
really fought for the free Tex field
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
data and uh federal judges ordered them
 
05:23:41.190 --> 05:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
to produce it all 6 something million
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
free text entries over the course of 12
 
05:23:45.590 --> 05:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
months we've gotten the first two to
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
three we got the first essentially um
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
they've done the first two that when
 
05:23:51.750 --> 05:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
we've taken a look at those tranches
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
about 300 something thousand entries
 
05:23:55.830 --> 05:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's an increasing number we'll have all
 
05:23:59.310 --> 05:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
around 7 million entries by the end of
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
like about another 10 months from now
 
05:24:04.190 --> 05:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
and um there's a reason that the CDC
 
05:24:06.030 --> 05:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
really really didn't want the public to
 
05:24:07.948 --> 05:24:07.958 align:start position:0%
see that for example what I told you
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
earlier that Professor who's saying Help
 
05:24:13.590 --> 05:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
Me Help Me disclosing a crescendo of of
 
05:24:17.110 --> 05:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
of really really concerning issues and
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
also they they they tell real stories of
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
real people with real harm who all went
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
out and thought they were engaging in
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
their civic duty by going to get this
 
05:24:26.430 --> 05:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
product and then when they went back to
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
the same Health authorities who told
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
them it's safe and effective you should
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
go do this pleading begging for help
 
05:24:33.230 --> 05:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
disclosing these harms they were just
 
05:24:35.708 --> 05:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
ignored represent P
 
05:24:39.750 --> 05:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
off thank you Madame chair so so so you
 
05:24:42.430 --> 05:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
testified that some some of those
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
symptoms are blamed on normal uh immune
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
response expected and desired
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
reactogenicity so what is the expected
 
05:24:58.350 --> 05:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh period uh for normal
 
05:25:01.110 --> 05:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
reactogenicity uh I I would think it was
 
05:25:03.868 --> 05:25:03.878 align:start position:0%
supposed to be limited to just a few
 
05:25:03.878 --> 05:25:04.868 align:start position:0%
supposed to be limited to just a few
couple

05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
couple
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
day couple first days or is it is it
 
05:25:12.590 --> 05:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
normal is it expected for it to last
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
weeks no it's supposed to It's supposed
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
to completely resolved within the first
 
05:25:19.868 --> 05:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
week and they're supposed to generally
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
be mild you know obviously it's going to
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
hurt for most folks when they get a
 
05:25:25.750 --> 05:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
needle put in the arm there's going to
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
be some swelling in the arm for many for
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
a large percentage of folks those are
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
the type of things that they they um
 
05:25:33.510 --> 05:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
they expect and and they expect them to
 
05:25:35.868 --> 05:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
subside uh they don't expect things to
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
continue after the first week
 
05:25:40.270 --> 05:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
but they didn't track any symptoms after
 
05:25:44.830 --> 05:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:47.670 --> 05:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
they so
 
05:25:49.948 --> 05:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
Penza so I have two questions thank you
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair I have two questions um one
 
05:25:54.510 --> 05:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
was the
 
05:25:57.350 --> 05:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and you answered it which was the the
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
free form and what did you say was the
 
05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
character limit U well it was generally
 
05:26:04.350 --> 05:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
250 character character limit for
 
05:26:05.910 --> 05:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and there were a number of
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
spots you could put in information what
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
we have seen is that some folks they'll
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
just use any of the free forms to try
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
and put in and tell their story to the
 
05:26:16.750 --> 05:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
to the health authorities they a lot of
 
05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
these folks didn't know where to go or
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
what to do you know they go to their
 
05:26:21.350 --> 05:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
doctor they say I got an injury from a
 
05:26:23.590 --> 05:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine and as you know the
 
05:26:25.548 --> 05:26:25.558 align:start position:0%
typical Medical Professional does they
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
say no no can't be you know vaccines are
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
safe and effective so then they're left
 
05:26:33.110 --> 05:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know looking for help they so they
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
often will turn back to the very health
 
05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
authori who told them to get it they
 
05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
were signed up a vsafe they try to
 
05:26:39.390 --> 05:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
report it to there
 
05:26:41.830 --> 05:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay so my other question was if let's
 
05:26:45.430 --> 05:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
say I was a vsafe user and I I I did the
 
05:26:48.190 --> 05:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
um the um the app or the program
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
throughout can I go back in and see what
 
05:26:50.638 --> 05:26:53.390 align:start position:0%
throughout can I go back in and see what
I

05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
submitted um good question I uh I'm not
 
05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
certain I'm not certain but uh we if
 
05:27:03.628 --> 05:27:03.638 align:start position:0%
it's but um if you know your your user
 
05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
ID you can go to Ian site and you can
 
05:27:08.910 --> 05:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
actually pull up your report and see all
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
the check the box data you submitted and
 
05:27:13.670 --> 05:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
by the end of about a year from now
 
05:27:15.270 --> 05:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to also go in and see all
 
05:27:17.190 --> 05:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
the free text forms that you
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
submitted follow up yeah because I'm
 
05:27:21.670 --> 05:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
just thinking right when you're in the
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
middle of something these people were
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
gung-ho they wanted to do the right
 
05:27:27.990 --> 05:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
thing and and then stuff is not
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
happening you're not going to think to
 
05:27:32.548 --> 05:27:32.558 align:start position:0%
screen capture or whatever and right and
 
05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't if you're not able to go
 
05:27:36.868 --> 05:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
back in to see that would be um yeah you
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
know what and I think about it though
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the professor who sent me hers I you
 
05:27:42.910 --> 05:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
know what it's a good question I'm not
 
05:27:44.510 --> 05:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
sure I could get back to you on that for
 
05:27:48.270 --> 05:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
sure yeah that would be great thank you
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay so uh there there we've got
 
05:27:54.910 --> 05:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
the two premere of Safety Systems and
 
05:27:56.670 --> 05:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
what it is we've uncovered regarding
 
05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
them and you know and if you look at
 
05:27:58.160 --> 05:27:59.110 align:start position:0%
them and you know and if you look at
other

05:27:59.110 --> 05:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
vaccines I don't think it should be
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
surprising frankly about how they've
 
05:28:06.070 --> 05:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
dealt with postlicensure safety review
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
of these products um uh in many ways you
 
05:28:12.708 --> 05:28:12.718 align:start position:0%
know um religion comes in all forms and
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
there I really do have religious beliefs
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
with regards to these products I find um
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the folks who engage in
 
05:28:21.510 --> 05:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
promoting them on the federal level in
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
particular um this is just one group
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
called react 19 um uh started by Brian
 
05:28:32.430 --> 05:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
Dron who was injured as a uh participant
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
in the astrogenic clinical trial as well
 
05:28:36.030 --> 05:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
as Joe wasog who was an orthopedic
 
05:28:37.310 --> 05:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
surgeon who got the madna vaccine and
 
05:28:38.670 --> 05:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
could no longer
 
05:28:40.270 --> 05:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
um performed surgeries because of his
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
injury from U the madna covid vaccine
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
that group that one group in America
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
says that it has over 36,000 Americans
 
05:28:50.990 --> 05:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
who are seriously injured from covid-19
 
05:28:53.510 --> 05:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine they're an amazing organization
 
05:28:54.990 --> 05:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
they they're focuses to help people
 
05:28:57.230 --> 05:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
injured with covid-19 vaccines and I
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
know that they have regular calls and
 
05:29:00.470 --> 05:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
try been trying to interact with the
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
federal health agencies and trying to
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
get help um you know um so I I use that
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
as an example of again just one group
 
05:29:11.830 --> 05:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
that is out there and to show this the
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
scope of the of the potential issues our
 
05:29:18.430 --> 05:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
firm as well um you know we've get we
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
can't we don't bring claims for covid-19
 
05:29:22.910 --> 05:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries because there's not
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
really any place to file a claim that's
 
05:29:27.948 --> 05:29:27.958 align:start position:0%
worthwhile but we get calls all day long
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
um email submissions and forms from
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
folks injured by covid-19 vaccines and
 
05:29:34.350 --> 05:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
then I can as well um gets you know
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
folks injured with Co Conta them all day
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
long I mean we're just um you know three
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
three group one you know two nonprofits
 
05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
and one law firm and between us the
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
number of seriously injured individual
 
05:29:49.230 --> 05:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine is
 
05:29:54.510 --> 05:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know equates to a uh um a cade of
 
05:29:57.590 --> 05:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
pain and suffering crossing the entire
 
05:30:00.670 --> 05:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
country that brings us then to uh the
 
05:30:03.150 --> 05:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
issue of transmission and obviously the
 
05:30:05.390 --> 05:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
whole reason that the
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
um um they said you you know the the
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
underpinning argument for why they had
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
to mandate covid vaccines was to stop
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
transmission that's typically the
 
05:30:16.230 --> 05:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
argument for why they have to require
 
05:30:16.240 --> 05:30:17.510 align:start position:0%
argument for why they have to require
any

05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:30:21.948 --> 05:30:21.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so um you know um because if
 
05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
you think about it you know heart
 
05:30:25.628 --> 05:30:25.638 align:start position:0%
medicine for examples Hardy is number
 
05:30:27.830 --> 05:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
one killer of Americans every year
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
700,000 folks does that mean we mandate
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
Statin does that mean we mandate
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
exercise you know you name it no because
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
we all intuitively get it that that
 
05:30:38.590 --> 05:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
would just be
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
incredibly destructive to individual and
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
civil rights like we have intuitive
 
05:30:43.948 --> 05:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
understanding but the moment for some
 
05:30:46.150 --> 05:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
reason you slap the word vaccine on
 
05:30:47.350 --> 05:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
something it's like oh yeah well you
 
05:30:49.510 --> 05:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
could throw all of your rights away now
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
I don't you know there's a and that's an
 
05:30:53.628 --> 05:30:53.638 align:start position:0%
ethos that has developed over time in
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
part from what I discussed earlier
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
Decades of Pharma having its way with no
 
05:30:59.750 --> 05:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
opposition with regards to these
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
products um what's incredible to me
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
frankly is that Regulators acted
 
05:31:06.230 --> 05:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
surprised that covid-19 vaccines do not
 
05:31:07.990 --> 05:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
stop transmission and we'll go through
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
that in a minute and the question is
 
05:31:11.470 --> 05:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
should they have been should they have
 
05:31:14.150 --> 05:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
been right I I I want to be clear that
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
even if covid vaccines stopped
 
05:31:18.430 --> 05:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
transmission I want to be very
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
clear I don't take an ideological
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
position about these products in terms
 
05:31:23.310 --> 05:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
of you want to get them get them don't
 
05:31:25.470 --> 05:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
get them don't get them they're product
 
05:31:27.548 --> 05:31:27.558 align:start position:0%
but they should never be mandated even
 
05:31:29.350 --> 05:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
if they stop transmission that said
 
05:31:32.190 --> 05:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
these products don't and what's really
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
interesting to me was that somehow the
 
05:31:36.830 --> 05:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
CDC director and all these folks seem
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
surprised when that information came out
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
and so should they have been do all
 
05:31:44.270 --> 05:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
other vaccin stop transmission what is
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
it that they should have already been
 
05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
aware of with regards to other vaccines
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I think again we'll take a quick
 
05:31:52.470 --> 05:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
look at other vaccines as a backdrop on
 
05:31:56.030 --> 05:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
that question um so this is the uh this
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
is the New Hampshire uh School vaccine
 
05:32:00.750 --> 05:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
requirements these are the vaccines
 
05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
required for school in New Hampshire
 
05:32:03.628 --> 05:32:03.638 align:start position:0%
it's basically you have five vaccines
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
here that required dap teap polio hey
 
05:32:09.110 --> 05:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
MMR and chickenpox okay so I'll use
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
those as the the Baseline if if I may
 
05:32:15.670 --> 05:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
let's start with polio okay now oral
 
05:32:17.628 --> 05:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
polio vaccine they used to be given can
 
05:32:19.708 --> 05:32:19.718 align:start position:0%
stop transmission to a degree because
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
polio proliferates in the intestinal
 
05:32:25.310 --> 05:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
Linings it's fecal to oral contamination
 
05:32:28.750 --> 05:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's how it's transmitted okay if a
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine only creates immunity in the
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
blood IGG antibodies and creates no
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
immunity in your intestinal aligning IGA
 
05:32:36.190 --> 05:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
antibodies not going to stop
 
05:32:36.200 --> 05:32:38.270 align:start position:0%
antibodies not going to stop
transmission

05:32:38.270 --> 05:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
in America the exclusive vaccine for the
 
05:32:43.708 --> 05:32:43.718 align:start position:0%
last 24 years given to Children is
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
inactivated polio vaccine it's injected
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
does not create immunity in intestinal
 
05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
Linings does
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
not stop transmission that might sound
 
05:32:55.708 --> 05:32:55.718 align:start position:0%
incredible but I'm not going to say it
 
05:32:57.948 --> 05:32:57.958 align:start position:0%
let's see the CDC say it right here on
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
your screen with the link to the CDC web
 
05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
page it says ipv protects people against
 
05:33:03.910 --> 05:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
all three types of polio virus ipv does
 
05:33:05.830 --> 05:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
not contain L virus can cannot cause
 
05:33:08.990 --> 05:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
disease it protects people from disease
 
05:33:12.990 --> 05:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
but does not stop transmission of the
 
05:33:15.948 --> 05:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
virus if you have only been injected
 
05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
with activated polio vaccine it is at
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
best personal protection that's all it's
 
05:33:23.868 --> 05:33:23.878 align:start position:0%
like asthma inhaler maybe we want you to
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
do it but should we crush your rights if
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
you won't do
 
05:33:28.000 --> 05:33:29.910 align:start position:0%
you won't do
it

05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
so and there it is right on the CDC
 
05:33:33.670 --> 05:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
website that's because it only creates
 
05:33:35.390 --> 05:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
immunity in the blood it maybe will stop
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
the polio virus from going from your
 
05:33:38.390 --> 05:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
intestines into blood and then for
 
05:33:39.390 --> 05:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
getting to your spinal column and
 
05:33:42.030 --> 05:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
causing my litis you know uh damage to
 
05:33:44.270 --> 05:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
your spinal column potentially can I can
 
05:33:46.510 --> 05:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
I just ask I just want to make sure I
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
understand this so if you get the
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
polio if you infected with polio virus
 
05:33:55.830 --> 05:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
right if you're infected with the polio
 
05:33:58.510 --> 05:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
virus and you've had the um inactivated
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
polio vaccine thank you you necessarily
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
won't get the U polio but you can
 
05:34:07.150 --> 05:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
actually transmit to that to somebody
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
who hasn't has been vaccinated is 100%
 
05:34:12.670 --> 05:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
it does nothing to prevent transmission
 
05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's right there on the CDC website does
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
not stop transmission of the virus which
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
is why The Who and CDC guidelines that
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
if polio virus were to return everybody
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
needs to get opv vaccine everybody in
 
05:34:26.310 --> 05:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
America today who's 24 and younger or
 
05:34:27.470 --> 05:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
longer than that because you're giving
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
it older um has never received a vaccine
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
for Polar that prevents transmission
 
05:34:34.910 --> 05:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's Decades of kids in this country
 
05:34:37.750 --> 05:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
with no uh they may be reduce symtoms
 
05:34:39.750 --> 05:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
Now understand 95% of people who are
 
05:34:41.150 --> 05:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
infected with polio virus are
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic they never show any
 
05:34:45.030 --> 05:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
symptoms whatsoever CDC another 4% of
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
POS posy symptomatic a little bit of
 
05:34:49.470 --> 05:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
symptoms 1% might have symptoms that are
 
05:34:51.150 --> 05:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
actually of concern and TIY percent are
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
even more you know can end up with an
 
05:34:56.670 --> 05:34:56.680 align:start position:0%
issue with that said uh yes for you know
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the vaccine is potentially can
 
05:35:02.430 --> 05:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the the the symptoms the disease
 
05:35:04.230 --> 05:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
as as as you would call it but it
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop transmission I'm not making
 
05:35:08.430 --> 05:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
any charact I'm judging on get the
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
product don't get the product but the
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
point is one of civil liberties about
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
individual rights should you crush
 
05:35:15.470 --> 05:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
people's rights for refusing a product
 
05:35:17.110 --> 05:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
that doesn't prevent transmission and
 
05:35:20.190 --> 05:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
obviously the the reality is and then
 
05:35:23.070 --> 05:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
separately should Michelle wilinsky the
 
05:35:27.470 --> 05:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
CDC director been on CNN going oh nobody
 
05:35:29.390 --> 05:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
told me it couldn't stop transmission
 
05:35:31.750 --> 05:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
maybe right should she been doing that
 
05:35:34.150 --> 05:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
or should she have maybe known wait a
 
05:35:36.270 --> 05:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
second we got a lot of vaccines that
 
05:35:38.350 --> 05:35:38.360 align:start position:0%
don't stop transmission including ones
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
we you know um so here is uh the global
 
05:35:45.390 --> 05:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
eradication initiative wh CDC and they
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
explain it in their own words again
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's the link down there ipv induces
 
05:35:50.390 --> 05:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
very low levels of immunity in the
 
05:35:51.708 --> 05:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
intestine as a result when a person
 
05:35:53.350 --> 05:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
immunized with ipv is infected with wild
 
05:35:56.788 --> 05:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
po virus the virus can still multiply
 
05:35:58.070 --> 05:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
inside the intestines and be shed in the
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
feces risking continuous ulation ipv
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
does not trans stop transmission of the
 
05:36:03.868 --> 05:36:03.878 align:start position:0%
virus the reason we don't use opv
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
anymore in this country is because it
 
05:36:07.670 --> 05:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
can cause paralysis actually the the the
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
attenuated version so okay let's move on
 
05:36:13.868 --> 05:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
to to the next vaccine um on the
 
05:36:16.190 --> 05:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
schedule is diptheria vaccine now
 
05:36:17.788 --> 05:36:17.798 align:start position:0%
diptheria is a
 
05:36:19.788 --> 05:36:19.798 align:start position:0%
bacteria the bacteria itself doesn't
 
05:36:21.270 --> 05:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
harm you sometimes the bacteria can
 
05:36:23.110 --> 05:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
release a toxin that can harm you the
 
05:36:25.708 --> 05:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine just creates immunity to that
 
05:36:28.708 --> 05:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
toxin there is nothing in the vial of a
 
05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
deia vaccine that creates immunity to
 
05:36:32.270 --> 05:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
the deia
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
bacteria nothing it's a toxoid vaccine
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
it only creat immunity to a toxin
 
05:36:42.830 --> 05:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes released by the Der bacteria
 
05:36:45.628 --> 05:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
okay so here's a CDC study explaining
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
dether toxoid helps prevent symptomatic
 
05:36:49.548 --> 05:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
disease but does not prevent the carrier
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
State nor stop the spread of infection
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
the bacteria will still multiply and
 
05:36:53.390 --> 05:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
proliferate in your body the known
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
importance of carriers in the spread of
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
deia and the demonstrated failure of
 
05:36:57.310 --> 05:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
toxo to prevent the carrier State lead
 
05:36:58.430 --> 05:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
us conclude that the concept of her
 
05:37:00.030 --> 05:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
immunity is not applicable to the
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
prevention of deia here's tetanus
 
05:37:05.150 --> 05:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
tetanus is just like deia vaccine it is
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
a toxoid vaccine it will only create
 
05:37:11.910 --> 05:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
immunity to a a a toxin sometimes
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
released by that bacteria okay um
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
interestingly it has to be lifel lied
 
05:37:19.070 --> 05:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
meaning it has to actually the bacteria
 
05:37:21.070 --> 05:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
be infected by a virus to then release a
 
05:37:23.548 --> 05:37:23.558 align:start position:0%
toxin it's different story separately
 
05:37:25.150 --> 05:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
tetanus is not transmissible from person
 
05:37:26.590 --> 05:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
to person Anyway by the way so it
 
05:37:28.270 --> 05:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't even matter so the vaccine
 
05:37:29.350 --> 05:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't create any immunity to the
 
05:37:31.110 --> 05:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
bacteria and the bacteria can't go from
 
05:37:32.590 --> 05:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
person to person in any event so it
 
05:37:35.430 --> 05:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter so we've now done polio
 
05:37:38.430 --> 05:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
deia tetanus now we're going to do tus
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
okay here's prus vaccine I think prosus
 
05:37:42.910 --> 05:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine is the most instructive one
 
05:37:44.910 --> 05:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
frankly because it's kind of similar
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
like covid in the follow vaccine in the
 
05:37:46.718 --> 05:37:48.230 align:start position:0%
like covid in the follow vaccine in the
following

05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
following
 
05:37:53.310 --> 05:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
way um prusis vaccine can reduce
 
05:37:55.830 --> 05:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
symptoms for sure just like covid
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine can reduce symptoms to for a
 
05:37:59.788 --> 05:37:59.798 align:start position:0%
period of time just like tetanus V they
 
05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
all can they reduce symptoms for some
 
05:38:05.190 --> 05:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
duration I mean tetanus and deia Wayan
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
so rapidly you have to get six shots as
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
a kid and then one every 10 years for
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of your life that's how quickly
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
that immunity wains so again I don't
 
05:38:14.830 --> 05:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
know why relle willinsky and were
 
05:38:16.910 --> 05:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
surprised when covid vaccine immunity
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
weigh but that's a separate story before
 
05:38:20.510 --> 05:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
prusis vaccine was introduced in the
 
05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
United States all the studies reflected
 
05:38:24.190 --> 05:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
that they thought prusis immunity was
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
lifelong once you had protestas once
 
05:38:27.150 --> 05:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's because you were naturally
 
05:38:29.070 --> 05:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
continued to be infected afterwards the
 
05:38:30.670 --> 05:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
thing is is that when they started
 
05:38:32.270 --> 05:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinating people with protus they
 
05:38:34.270 --> 05:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
realized something really strange the
 
05:38:37.110 --> 05:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
level of U circulating protus bacteria
 
05:38:40.750 --> 05:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
did not go down they didn't know why
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
well FDA did a study and in this study
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
they started with baboons because they
 
05:38:47.590 --> 05:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't purposely infect humans and if
 
05:38:49.230 --> 05:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
you look at this chart on the right this
 
05:38:51.628 --> 05:38:51.638 align:start position:0%
is an FDA study they found that naive
 
05:38:53.430 --> 05:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
which means that's the Blue Line those
 
05:38:56.430 --> 05:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
are the baboons that never had
 
05:38:58.750 --> 05:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
prosus they would stick a swab up their
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
nose and they would culture the uh uh uh
 
05:39:03.990 --> 05:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
to see if they can culture prusas they
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
were culturing pusas from their naso
 
05:39:10.350 --> 05:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
fairings for about 30 days okay AP
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's a cellular prosus that's the only
 
05:39:13.468 --> 05:39:13.478 align:start position:0%
protus vacine used in the United States
 
05:39:15.708 --> 05:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
since 2000 remember the dtp one that
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
kills more kids than it saves that they
 
05:39:20.310 --> 05:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't use that here they were culturing
 
05:39:22.430 --> 05:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
prusas from the nose of the baboons for
 
05:39:26.670 --> 05:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
almost 35 days they were more infectious
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
for a longer period of time because a
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
cellular protestos vaccine actually will
 
05:39:34.150 --> 05:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
reduce symptoms but it does not prevent
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
the protestas bacteria from being able
 
05:39:37.868 --> 05:39:37.878 align:start position:0%
to proliferate in multip
 
05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
in your n of fairings and for you to
 
05:39:43.190 --> 05:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
spread it the FDA was shocked by this
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
finding and what's the most amazing part
 
05:39:47.948 --> 05:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
is that for decades they claimed
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise that was followed on by an
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
entire International Convention of all
 
05:39:53.468 --> 05:39:53.478 align:start position:0%
the world leading
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinologists protus experts and here's
 
05:39:58.548 --> 05:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
their conclusion in in you know P study
 
05:40:00.510 --> 05:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
they say a cell protest vaccine cannot
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
avoid infection transmission it
 
05:40:04.390 --> 05:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
protestas vaccines do not prevent
 
05:40:06.390 --> 05:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
colonization consequently do not reduce
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
the circulation of board to tasus and
 
05:40:10.750 --> 05:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
did not exert any her immunity effect if
 
05:40:12.270 --> 05:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
you take issue with that talk to them
 
05:40:15.070 --> 05:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
not me that's that is what the data show
 
05:40:16.670 --> 05:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know maybe I'm I'm just naive
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes but if
 
05:40:27.270 --> 05:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't reduce the circulation yes
 
05:40:30.270 --> 05:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't exert any hert immunity
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
what is the point of it it reduces
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
symptoms it reduces symptoms for a for a
 
05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
for a limited duration of time so um um
 
05:40:42.030 --> 05:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
like I said after uh you get it a 2
 
05:40:44.830 --> 05:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
months 4 months 6 months 18 months 4
 
05:40:46.830 --> 05:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
years and then you get one at 11 years
 
05:40:49.708 --> 05:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
of age that's six Doses and within two
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
years of that um your antibody levels
 
05:40:54.510 --> 05:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
are basically down to like 10 basically
 
05:40:56.590 --> 05:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
only 10% of people are still considered
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
protected from symptoms but protestos is
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
really only of concern to little babies
 
05:41:03.030 --> 05:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
protestas is not really of an issue for
 
05:41:05.190 --> 05:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
adults I mean you can get protestas you
 
05:41:06.510 --> 05:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
might have a bit of a cough or whatever
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
but it's really only dangerous for for
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
little babies and there's a whole
 
05:41:13.788 --> 05:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
discussion around that but um yeah I
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean it's a great question they tell you
 
05:41:18.190 --> 05:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
to get protus vaccine to protect for
 
05:41:19.868 --> 05:41:19.878 align:start position:0%
example they'll tell you oh get it
 
05:41:21.868 --> 05:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
before you see a baby but actually if
 
05:41:24.190 --> 05:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
you get it you're more likely to
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
transmit to the baby because you have
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
less likely to have symptoms but still
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
as likely to transmit it they did all
 
05:41:33.548 --> 05:41:33.558 align:start position:0%
these studies what they called cocooning
 
05:41:34.628 --> 05:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
where they were like okay let's give
 
05:41:36.430 --> 05:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
protest vaccine to every the grandma the
 
05:41:39.030 --> 05:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
mom the cousin everybody around the baby
 
05:41:41.750 --> 05:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
and did that have any effect on protus
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the in the babies and they found no
 
05:41:46.190 --> 05:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
cocooning doesn't work act anything
 
05:41:47.788 --> 05:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
cocooning made it more likely you give
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
it to the baby
 
05:41:53.350 --> 05:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
because it reduces symptoms
 
05:41:55.230 --> 05:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful but then you don't know you
 
05:41:57.628 --> 05:41:57.638 align:start position:0%
have it you're not staying home you're
 
05:41:59.150 --> 05:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
not stopping holding the baby because
 
05:42:00.750 --> 05:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
you don't know you you're infected in
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
your transmitting it in your naso
 
05:42:08.628 --> 05:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
fairings anyway represent Potenza oh
 
05:42:11.590 --> 05:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam shair I was just
 
05:42:12.948 --> 05:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
you kind of just answered that I was
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
just going to say wouldn't that be more
 
05:42:16.830 --> 05:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
likely that the baby would be infected
 
05:42:21.788 --> 05:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
then yes it would yes um um so you know
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
we actually we we Foy the CDC again
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
asking them come on do you have any
 
05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
documents show it doesn't prevent
 
05:42:28.350 --> 05:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
transmission and they sent us the two
 
05:42:31.310 --> 05:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
studies I just showed you guys we also
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
this was my favorite one we petitioned
 
05:42:35.628 --> 05:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
formerly the CD the FDA to change the
 
05:42:39.030 --> 05:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
labeling on the pusis uh products to add
 
05:42:40.510 --> 05:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
the warning that you could be more
 
05:42:42.390 --> 05:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
likely to transmit it doesn't prevent
 
05:42:44.430 --> 05:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
transmission and they wrote us back and
 
05:42:45.868 --> 05:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
you right there's the link you can read
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
this fda's response and they said oh we
 
05:42:49.830 --> 05:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to change the landing there's
 
05:42:51.390 --> 05:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
no confusion in the marketplace
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
everybody knows it doesn't stop
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
transmission read it yourself it's it's
 
05:42:59.468 --> 05:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
it's incredible actually okay uh just
 
05:43:01.070 --> 05:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
like what we said reducing symptoms
 
05:43:02.510 --> 05:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
while remaining able to transmit makes
 
05:43:05.628 --> 05:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
one more likely to transmit and uh you
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
know in this article it explains that
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
you know the way that you know how much
 
05:43:10.510 --> 05:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
circulating bacteria there is is you
 
05:43:12.350 --> 05:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
look at the inter epidemic intervals
 
05:43:14.590 --> 05:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
okay the interepidemic intervals meaning
 
05:43:17.788 --> 05:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
how many cohorts you have that are not
 
05:43:20.030 --> 05:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
U folks who've never had it basically
 
05:43:24.390 --> 05:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
has either stayed the same or has gotten
 
05:43:26.788 --> 05:43:26.798 align:start position:0%
shorter now there are less cases of
 
05:43:28.390 --> 05:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
disease because the vaccine can reduce
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
symptoms but there's actually apparently
 
05:43:33.150 --> 05:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
more circulating protestos bacteria out
 
05:43:37.948 --> 05:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
there and um the problem is that is that
 
05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
the the the pertusus bacteria has five
 
05:43:41.520 --> 05:43:42.468 align:start position:0%
the the the pertusus bacteria has five
about

05:43:42.468 --> 05:43:42.478 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
3,000 antigens on a Surface the bacteria
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
the vaccine has only about five of those
 
05:43:49.510 --> 05:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
antigens in the vial okay so it creates
 
05:43:51.670 --> 05:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
this defective form of immunity called
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
linked EPO you know linked epitope
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
suppression so the next time you're
 
05:43:57.150 --> 05:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
infected with pertusus your body has a
 
05:43:59.070 --> 05:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
robust immune response to those five
 
05:44:02.788 --> 05:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
epitopes but not to the other 2,995
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
approximately so your defective immunity
 
05:44:07.230 --> 05:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
results in you actually being able to
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
become infected over and over and over
 
05:44:12.788 --> 05:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
and over and studies like this one have
 
05:44:14.788 --> 05:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
discussed this issue and in fact one of
 
05:44:17.990 --> 05:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
the premier vaccinologists on this issue
 
05:44:20.230 --> 05:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
according to the medical community at
 
05:44:22.910 --> 05:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
UCLA has proposed that the only solution
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
I think apparently is to make a vaccine
 
05:44:29.868 --> 05:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.830 --> 05:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
2995 you don't have to fix your immunity
 
05:44:34.390 --> 05:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
that they've created which renders you
 
05:44:37.110 --> 05:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
susceptible if you've got protestas if
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
you actually had pressus once now you
 
05:44:42.230 --> 05:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
have immunity and you do not transmit it
 
05:44:44.510 --> 05:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
and we saw that in the baboon study done
 
05:44:47.788 --> 05:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
one and done except you know the studies
 
05:44:49.830 --> 05:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
show that you know like vaccine immunity
 
05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
natural immun apparently it at least
 
05:44:54.590 --> 05:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
some of the studies reflect it too can
 
05:44:56.590 --> 05:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
Wayne but if you're continue to Expos to
 
05:45:00.590 --> 05:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
it then it stays um robust now do we
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
exclude those vaccinated for protesters
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
from the work school military after all
 
05:45:07.430 --> 05:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
aren't they more likely to spread it
 
05:45:10.468 --> 05:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
I mean the kid with symptoms knows to
 
05:45:12.190 --> 05:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
stay home from school the kid without
 
05:45:14.788 --> 05:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
symptoms doesn't does that mean we
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
exclude vaccinated children from school
 
05:45:19.948 --> 05:45:19.958 align:start position:0%
who have protestas because they're more
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
like to spread it of course not of
 
05:45:24.830 --> 05:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
course we don't because we shouldn't
 
05:45:24.840 --> 05:45:26.430 align:start position:0%
course we don't because we shouldn't
exclude

05:45:26.430 --> 05:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
05:45:30.270 --> 05:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
anybody from making a personal medical
 
05:45:30.280 --> 05:45:31.990 align:start position:0%
anybody from making a personal medical
decision

05:45:31.990 --> 05:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:45:34.868 --> 05:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
okay uh those give us so you know we did
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
polio we did daap taap um
 
05:45:38.990 --> 05:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
those are just some there are other
 
05:45:40.350 --> 05:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
examples we could look at at ninako
 
05:45:41.548 --> 05:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine and other ones but let's just
 
05:45:45.030 --> 05:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
stop there the point is that they really
 
05:45:47.110 --> 05:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been surprised that covid
 
05:45:48.190 --> 05:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine couldn't stop transmission
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
because that's true of many vaccines now
 
05:45:52.468 --> 05:45:52.478 align:start position:0%
measles vaccine can stop transmission
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
Chickenpox vaccine can stop transmission
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
but these most other vaccines most of
 
05:45:58.590 --> 05:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
the vaccines required for school in New
 
05:46:02.110 --> 05:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example do not stop
 
05:46:04.750 --> 05:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
transmission as we noted earlier they
 
05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
could have easily tested in the clinical
 
05:46:09.070 --> 05:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
trial whether or not covid vaccine
 
05:46:11.030 --> 05:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
stopped transmission they just had to
 
05:46:12.910 --> 05:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
basically test everybody every week in
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
the trial test just 30 40,000 people
 
05:46:16.948 --> 05:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
they were testing millions of Americans
 
05:46:18.548 --> 05:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
every week every five days every three
 
05:46:20.548 --> 05:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
seconds but yet they couldn't do it in
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
the trial come
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
on I think they knew there would be a
 
05:46:28.750 --> 05:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
problem most likely um here is the FDA
 
05:46:30.468 --> 05:46:30.478 align:start position:0%
itself saying the fda's authorization
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
and Licensing standards for vaccines do
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
not require demonstration the prevention
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
infection transmission this is what they
 
05:46:37.948 --> 05:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
told us when we want to add indications
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the labels showing that various
 
05:46:41.468 --> 05:46:41.478 align:start position:0%
vaccines don't stop transmission they
 
05:46:43.390 --> 05:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
said well we don't license on that basis
 
05:46:46.030 --> 05:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
and in fact vaccines are not licensed on
 
05:46:47.468 --> 05:46:47.478 align:start position:0%
the basis that they sto transmission
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
they're just licensed on the basis of
 
05:46:52.590 --> 05:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
reducing uh symptoms for some period of
 
05:46:56.628 --> 05:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
time and so they knew they did not have
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
the support to say that covid vaccines
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
did not stop transmission but that
 
05:47:03.030 --> 05:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
didn't stop them from saying it did they
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
because as I said earlier there's
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs around these products
 
05:47:08.190 --> 05:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
despite the evidence despite what they
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
even say themselves they will often
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
argue well we have to stop the spread we
 
05:47:14.868 --> 05:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
got to stop we got we got to kick kids
 
05:47:16.190 --> 05:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
out we got to do all these things we got
 
05:47:18.150 --> 05:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
to you know fire everybody from work who
 
05:47:19.628 --> 05:47:19.638 align:start position:0%
don't get a covid vaccine it's not
 
05:47:22.070 --> 05:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
really about it's about an ideology to
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
some degree okay here's relle wilinsky
 
05:47:28.990 --> 05:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
August 5th 2021 and she gets on CNN and
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
she says quote our vaccines are working
 
05:47:33.708 --> 05:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
exceptionally well they continue to work
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
well for Delta with regard to severe
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
disease illness and death put that
 
05:47:40.468 --> 05:47:40.478 align:start position:0%
portion aside they prevent it but what
 
05:47:43.070 --> 05:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
they can't do anymore is prevent
 
05:47:45.990 --> 05:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
transmission oh she was apparently
 
05:47:48.830 --> 05:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
surprised why did she say that she said
 
05:47:50.190 --> 05:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
that because this is a study from the
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
CDC the next day ma they published this
 
05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
in which they went out and they
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
carefully studied this outbreak of covid
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
and what they found was in a place that
 
05:48:04.910 --> 05:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
had a 69% covid vaccine coverage 74% of
 
05:48:07.350 --> 05:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
people who were infected
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
did had covid vaccine so it was
 
05:48:13.230 --> 05:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
disproportionately within the vaccinated
 
05:48:14.830 --> 05:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
and then they did the swabs like they
 
05:48:17.230 --> 05:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
did with the baboons and they found that
 
05:48:20.430 --> 05:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccinated had on average more virus
 
05:48:22.190 --> 05:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
in their nasal cavities than the
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated that were infected that's
 
05:48:26.310 --> 05:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
the cdc's own publication amazing they
 
05:48:28.150 --> 05:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
actually published this and then here's
 
05:48:31.030 --> 05:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
another study just August 24th 2021 not
 
05:48:33.270 --> 05:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
long afterwards they reviewed swab
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
specimens from 24 counties and they
 
05:48:39.030 --> 05:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
found a high viral Lo in 158 meaning of
 
05:48:42.390 --> 05:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
232 unvaccinated 68% of the unvaccinated
 
05:48:44.788 --> 05:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
had a high viral load in their nose but
 
05:48:47.990 --> 05:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
69% of the vaccinated had a high viral
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
load in their naso fairings and they
 
05:48:53.110 --> 05:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
similarly there was a high viral load is
 
05:48:56.750 --> 05:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
7 of 24 unvaccinated 29 and uh
 
05:48:59.750 --> 05:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
um U uh 11 of the fully vaccinated
 
05:49:02.788 --> 05:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic individuals so the the the
 
05:49:04.628 --> 05:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
the the first black bullet point is for
 
05:49:06.350 --> 05:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
symptomatic individuals the second one
 
05:49:08.788 --> 05:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
was for asymptomatic and frankly it's
 
05:49:09.868 --> 05:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
the second bullet point that should be
 
05:49:12.190 --> 05:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
the most concerning among the
 
05:49:13.948 --> 05:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic they had no symptoms so
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine was doing great it was reducing
 
05:49:21.150 --> 05:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
symptoms but 82% nine of 11 nine had a
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
high viral load unknowingly spreading
 
05:49:27.310 --> 05:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
covid in the vaccinated whereas only
 
05:49:30.750 --> 05:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
seven of the unv 29% amongst the
 
05:49:34.150 --> 05:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated had that asymptomatic
 
05:49:37.390 --> 05:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
spread I this study was was I think just
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
a watershed and in fact it's a great
 
05:49:41.390 --> 05:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
study because we foiled for all the
 
05:49:43.548 --> 05:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
inter there was a CDC uh author we said
 
05:49:44.990 --> 05:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
we foed for all the internal
 
05:49:46.510 --> 05:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
Communications the internal
 
05:49:47.948 --> 05:49:47.958 align:start position:0%
Communications on this study are
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
incredible journals did didn't want to
 
05:49:52.110 --> 05:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
publish it like they went round and
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
round and because you know they were
 
05:49:55.708 --> 05:49:55.718 align:start position:0%
like why would publish this is an
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
important finding um because it didn't
 
05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
it didn't fit the policy but they knew
 
05:50:02.350 --> 05:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
they knew before they went out and they
 
05:50:04.110 --> 05:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
went and crushed the rights of 100
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
million Americans with you know with the
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
o with the social requirements kicking
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
people out of the military going down
 
05:50:12.230 --> 05:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
that road they knew this product did not
 
05:50:13.750 --> 05:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
stop transmission there was no Public
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
Health imperative to do it yes I'm sorry
 
05:50:15.440 --> 05:50:17.750 align:start position:0%
Health imperative to do it yes I'm sorry
represent

05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:50:23.070 --> 05:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
blus I recall very early on
 
05:50:27.390 --> 05:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
um fouchi saying no you have to still
 
05:50:30.670 --> 05:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
wear masks because the vaccine won't
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
stop transmission yes do you recall when
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
that was compared to all of this
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
I think it was when Melle wilinsky said
 
05:50:42.190 --> 05:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
this in August I presume because that's
 
05:50:45.030 --> 05:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
when the CDC she said oh you can all
 
05:50:46.788 --> 05:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
take your masks off we're all free and
 
05:50:48.990 --> 05:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
then go she went then they they had this
 
05:50:51.708 --> 05:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
study in in uh in Massachusetts and then
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
they all went and they went did a 180 on
 
05:50:57.310 --> 05:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
that so I think it was very early and
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually I have a a little video I
 
05:51:00.948 --> 05:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
happened to just find it on on online
 
05:51:02.350 --> 05:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
last night on Twitter it came my feed
 
05:51:04.628 --> 05:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
and I I put it in here um and I think
 
05:51:05.788 --> 05:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
that's where I don't know if it has a
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
date we'll see in a second where fouchi
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
says that this by the way those are just
 
05:51:11.708 --> 05:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
two early Canary and the comont studies
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
there were large giant studies that
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
followed all showing the same thing we
 
05:51:18.910 --> 05:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
had huge exchange with CDC on this point
 
05:51:21.150 --> 05:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
um it was clear as day this product
 
05:51:25.070 --> 05:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
would not stop infection um and and what
 
05:51:27.230 --> 05:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
also made it super clear was just look
 
05:51:28.990 --> 05:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
at the rates of infections in highly
 
05:51:30.990 --> 05:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated developing countries in other
 
05:51:32.390 --> 05:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
highly vaccinated countries versus the
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
rate of infection in countries that did
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
not participate in these products it's
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
incredible okay so again representative
 
05:51:39.718 --> 05:51:41.510 align:start position:0%
incredible okay so again representative
beler

05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
beler
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair and I've
 
05:51:45.430 --> 05:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
got a I've got a couple questions that I
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
think will help with our investigation
 
05:51:48.990 --> 05:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
I'll of course ask you between to make
 
05:51:51.468 --> 05:51:51.478 align:start position:0%
sure I'm good to continue um but the
 
05:51:51.478 --> 05:51:53.430 align:start position:0%
sure I'm good to continue um but the
first

05:51:53.430 --> 05:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:51:55.948 --> 05:51:55.958 align:start position:0%
one it was a position of the government
 
05:51:58.190 --> 05:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
and pharmaceutical companies that the E
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
UA vaccines prevented Contracting the
 
05:52:02.590 --> 05:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
SARS Co 2 virus it was the their
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
position that the eua vaccines
 
05:52:07.150 --> 05:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
preventing transmission of the SAR Co 2
 
05:52:10.468 --> 05:52:10.478 align:start position:0%
virus it was the position of them that
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
they were safe and effective it is still
 
05:52:14.548 --> 05:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
the position of the government and
 
05:52:15.670 --> 05:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical industry that these
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
products reduce
 
05:52:19.628 --> 05:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
mortality and that they are safe and
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
effective my question then is given the
 
05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
totality of all the circumstances that
 
05:52:26.990 --> 05:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
you were aware of and have evidence for
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
do you believe there is a reasonable
 
05:52:32.510 --> 05:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
possibility that the legal immunity of
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
either the government Andor the
 
05:52:35.948 --> 05:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies should not
 
05:52:35.958 --> 05:52:36.990 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies should not
stand

05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
stand
 
05:52:40.670 --> 05:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
due to fraud censorship disinformation
 
05:52:44.708 --> 05:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
on efficacy or risks or any other
 
05:52:47.830 --> 05:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
reason politically absolutely it should
 
05:52:48.910 --> 05:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
not stand it shouldn't have been there
 
05:52:51.430 --> 05:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
to begin with because it just creates an
 
05:52:54.270 --> 05:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
incredible moral hazard hey you know
 
05:52:56.510 --> 05:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
what let's go into business and we're
 
05:52:59.430 --> 05:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
going to create a product and um the
 
05:53:01.350 --> 05:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
government's going to mandate it really
 
05:53:03.868 --> 05:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
what is the product Oh you you inject it
 
05:53:05.670 --> 05:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
oh what if it causes harm don't worry
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
you'll have immunity oh who the heck
 
05:53:09.070 --> 05:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
would take that don't worry they'll
 
05:53:10.830 --> 05:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
mandate it well what if people cry out
 
05:53:12.430 --> 05:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't worry they'll censor and they'll
 
05:53:15.070 --> 05:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
promote it with billions of dollars yeah
 
05:53:17.190 --> 05:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is essentially what we
 
05:53:20.548 --> 05:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
entered into politically speaking it
 
05:53:22.510 --> 05:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
should never have been there even absent
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
fraud if you're asking me um with what
 
05:53:28.590 --> 05:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
we know
 
05:53:31.030 --> 05:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
now it absolutely should all be
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
rescinded to the extent the government
 
05:53:34.270 --> 05:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
can they contractually agree to the
 
05:53:37.270 --> 05:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
immunity um and uh
 
05:53:39.270 --> 05:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
um and and and these products should
 
05:53:41.590 --> 05:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
just be treated like any others I
 
05:53:44.468 --> 05:53:44.478 align:start position:0%
mean you could sue people you could sue
 
05:53:47.628 --> 05:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
the maker of this pen for issues but I
 
05:53:50.270 --> 05:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
can't sue companies that inject a
 
05:53:53.708 --> 05:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
product into babies over and over and
 
05:53:56.670 --> 05:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
over again what they swear to you are
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
safe and effective really how does that
 
05:54:02.910 --> 05:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
make any sense they're so safe that they
 
05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
had to take away the ability to sue them
 
05:54:07.628 --> 05:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
for harm
 
05:54:10.468 --> 05:54:10.478 align:start position:0%
I I mean if that doesn't create like
 
05:54:11.868 --> 05:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
cognitive dissonance I don't know what
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
does it's like you know your head's got
 
05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
to spin from it so yes politically
 
05:54:20.390 --> 05:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely legally that's a more
 
05:54:23.390 --> 05:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
complicated question whether that is it
 
05:54:25.750 --> 05:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
would need to most likely happen in from
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
an act of federal
 
05:54:29.190 --> 05:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislation but there are things I think
 
05:54:31.310 --> 05:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
on the state level um that can be done
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to talk about those
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards thank you and if I may
 
05:54:41.590 --> 05:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
up um so oh please oh I'm so sorry
 
05:54:44.190 --> 05:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's all right so uh the next related
 
05:54:46.350 --> 05:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
question is um the state of New
 
05:54:48.868 --> 05:54:48.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a little bit of ambiguity
 
05:54:50.750 --> 05:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
with our current covid childhood
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations for
 
05:54:56.670 --> 05:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
injection currently we hear there is no
 
05:54:59.270 --> 05:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
official recommendation that is the
 
05:55:01.270 --> 05:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
position taken by the Department of
 
05:55:04.110 --> 05:55:04.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services however the
 
05:55:06.430 --> 05:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
official website has a section on child
 
05:55:08.910 --> 05:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hood Co vaccination that directs the
 
05:55:12.468 --> 05:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
user to the CDC guidelines they do so
 
05:55:14.670 --> 05:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
without explicitly stating those are CDC
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
and not New Hampshire
 
05:55:18.590 --> 05:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines and they do officially the
 
05:55:20.310 --> 05:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
CDC guidelines that it directs you to
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
take a recommendation on childhood
 
05:55:25.150 --> 05:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination So based on your legal
 
05:55:28.830 --> 05:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
expertise would you agree that DHHS in
 
05:55:33.350 --> 05:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by linking directly to the
 
05:55:37.510 --> 05:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
CDC website which recommends vaccinees
 
05:55:39.788 --> 05:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
under the New Hampshire website where it
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
talks about childhood vaccination for Co
 
05:55:44.670 --> 05:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
would you agree that they're taking no
 
05:55:46.270 --> 05:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
position or do you believe that they are
 
05:55:49.070 --> 05:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
taking a position based on what you just
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
said uh they are in my opinion based on
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
what you just said taking a position
 
05:55:56.868 --> 05:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
that would promote the covid-19 vaccine
 
05:55:58.590 --> 05:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
because that's apparently if a parent
 
05:56:02.110 --> 05:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
goes to their site and it leads them to
 
05:56:04.628 --> 05:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
the cdc's recommendation I you know most
 
05:56:07.390 --> 05:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
folks would assume that is the new sure
 
05:56:08.830 --> 05:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Health and Human
 
05:56:10.830 --> 05:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
Services position with regards to that
 
05:56:12.868 --> 05:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
product I I don't see how it could be
 
05:56:17.390 --> 05:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise thank you and if I may I yes
 
05:56:20.788 --> 05:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um we've learned from previous
 
05:56:22.788 --> 05:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm I'm going ask if
 
05:56:23.990 --> 05:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with this and if you
 
05:56:27.548 --> 05:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
have anything to add to it um let me
 
05:56:28.990 --> 05:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
preface it with this back when I was a
 
05:56:30.910 --> 05:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
paramedic years and years ago I was
 
05:56:32.430 --> 05:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
trained to administer intermuscular
 
05:56:33.868 --> 05:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
injections and part of that training
 
05:56:36.270 --> 05:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
process was to locate the injection cell
 
05:56:39.830 --> 05:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
site spread the Skin Out plunge the
 
05:56:42.548 --> 05:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
needle syringe aspirate to make sure I
 
05:56:44.110 --> 05:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't in a blood vessel before
 
05:56:46.468 --> 05:56:46.478 align:start position:0%
administering the shot now this
 
05:56:48.510 --> 05:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
information changed at some point point
 
05:56:50.750 --> 05:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
shortly before the covid
 
05:56:53.510 --> 05:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic and to my knowledge the
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine was the first that was
 
05:57:00.868 --> 05:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
if issued Official Guidelines to not
 
05:57:04.830 --> 05:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
aspirate before plunging the needle the
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
syringe to administer to shot um looking
 
05:57:09.468 --> 05:57:09.478 align:start position:0%
at the recommendations from the
 
05:57:11.070 --> 05:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines on this I believe it was a
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
CDC website can correct me if I'm wrong
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
um the rationale given for suspending
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
the long process of aspirating to make
 
05:57:22.788 --> 05:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
sure you weren't in a blood vessel was
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
done based on no evidence but the
 
05:57:29.468 --> 05:57:29.478 align:start position:0%
argument that there had been no previous
 
05:57:32.830 --> 05:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
data suggesting that you needed to and
 
05:57:34.990 --> 05:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
further that it may cause may not
 
05:57:37.750 --> 05:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
evidence may cause additional pain that
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
could put people off from vaccinations
 
05:57:42.510 --> 05:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
so you should not do this practice is
 
05:57:43.948 --> 05:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
that something you're aware of or having
 
05:57:46.430 --> 05:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
comment on I'm not aware of that
 
05:57:48.270 --> 05:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
actually that's interesting but it does
 
05:57:50.948 --> 05:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
fit with the the normal rubric um when
 
05:57:53.230 --> 05:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
it comes to these products in terms of
 
05:57:56.030 --> 05:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
how safety is approached which is in the
 
05:57:58.910 --> 05:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
absence of evidence that it causes harm
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.830 --> 05:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't and if I may one last
 
05:58:08.670 --> 05:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
uh and you may be coming to talk about
 
05:58:11.948 --> 05:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
this I don't know um but I want to ask
 
05:58:13.590 --> 05:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
you is this something you're aware of
 
05:58:15.070 --> 05:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
because I've heard this I don't think
 
05:58:17.070 --> 05:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
we've received testimony I may be wrong
 
05:58:23.030 --> 05:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
again on that but I believe that when
 
05:58:26.390 --> 05:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
these covid vaccines became officially
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
licensed as an approved by the
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
FDA uh the manufacturers continued to
 
05:58:37.230 --> 05:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
provide only the emergency use versions
 
05:58:40.230 --> 05:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
of them up until the
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
point that they were adopted by the
 
05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine schedule which
 
05:58:48.990 --> 05:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
conferred a different uh legal immunity
 
05:58:53.390 --> 05:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
to them so there was no period in which
 
05:58:56.788 --> 05:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
um the FDA version was given where they
 
05:58:59.310 --> 05:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
could have might not had immunity is
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
that something you're aware of yeah the
 
05:59:03.390 --> 05:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
the the pre yeah there I think there's a
 
05:59:05.110 --> 05:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
bit of confusion out there in terms of
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
the the applicable legal
 
05:59:09.990 --> 05:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
protections the prep act
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
immunity applies whether the product is
 
05:59:15.910 --> 05:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorized or
 
05:59:18.750 --> 05:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
licensed so it didn't
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
matter whether uh it was on the
 
05:59:23.270 --> 05:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
childhood schedule or not and whether
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
the 86 act applied or not as it stands
 
05:59:28.830 --> 05:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
right now you can't go into vaccine
 
05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
court for a covid vaccine injury you
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
can't go into the vicp the program
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
created by the ad6 ACT you need to to go
 
05:59:37.708 --> 05:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
into the program created by the prep act
 
05:59:40.910 --> 05:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
the cicp so the prep act imunity
 
05:59:43.390 --> 05:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
applies whether it's authorized or
 
05:59:46.430 --> 05:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
whether it's licensed in terms of uh
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
after it was licensed what was available
 
05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that one of the
 
05:59:54.310 --> 05:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
regulations that's Crystal Clear is that
 
05:59:57.868 --> 05:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
the military is not allowed to mandate
 
06:00:00.708 --> 06:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
an a product on its soldiers that that
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
are not licensed and so um there were
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that were brought after the
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine was authorized because
 
06:00:13.948 --> 06:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
there still wasn't actually vials that
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
were authorized vials there were still
 
06:00:17.670 --> 06:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
there were still emergency use Excuse me
 
06:00:20.110 --> 06:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
licensed vials there were still only eua
 
06:00:21.670 --> 06:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
vials in circulation there was so much
 
06:00:23.830 --> 06:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
of it that's pretty much what was
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
available and when uh the military was
 
06:00:30.070 --> 06:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
sued by a soldier saying hey you offered
 
06:00:32.310 --> 06:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
me an eua product the government
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
responded by saying either one you were
 
06:00:37.628 --> 06:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
offered a buy equivalent there was a
 
06:00:40.628 --> 06:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
list uh that when the covid vaccine was
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
licensed the FDA put out and said these
 
06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
batches of eua not all of them just
 
06:00:50.708 --> 06:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
these are the same as the licensed and
 
06:00:52.548 --> 06:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
can be treated as
 
06:00:55.468 --> 06:00:55.478 align:start position:0%
licensed and where the soldier was
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
offered something not in that list the
 
06:00:59.670 --> 06:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
military somehow
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
magically uh produced an actual
 
06:01:06.350 --> 06:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
licensed vial um there were some that
 
06:01:07.868 --> 06:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
they had available and they would then
 
06:01:09.590 --> 06:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
offer that to the soldier and we
 
06:01:13.190 --> 06:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
encountered exactly that scenario so uh
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
yeah for the most part uh for a long
 
06:01:16.910 --> 06:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
time there was only you know actually
 
06:01:18.110 --> 06:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't know the State of Affairs right
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
now because um I know for a long time
 
06:01:22.868 --> 06:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
there was no eua only eua product
 
06:01:26.868 --> 06:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
available in the United States um yeah
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that okay
 
06:01:33.270 --> 06:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
um uh so you know reducing symptoms
 
06:01:38.270 --> 06:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
while remaining able to transmit makes
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
one more likely to transmit we've
 
06:01:41.590 --> 06:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
covered that and that was true of covid
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines should states have crushed the
 
06:01:45.390 --> 06:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
rights of those that refuse this medical
 
06:01:47.070 --> 06:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
procedure I think that's
 
06:01:50.070 --> 06:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory should never do that um
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
as I pointed out earlier they could have
 
06:01:53.750 --> 06:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
easily tested for whether prevent
 
06:01:58.350 --> 06:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
transmission they didn't do it um and um
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
uh um you know I think that uh this is
 
06:02:02.750 --> 06:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
the video I told you I had found and I
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
included it though I I should disclaim I
 
06:02:06.670 --> 06:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
didn't put this together I just found
 
06:02:09.868 --> 06:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
this but it looks authentic to me so I
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
I'll play
 
06:02:13.590 --> 06:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
it okay you're not gonna you're not
 
06:02:15.708 --> 06:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
going to get Co if you have these
 
06:02:18.910 --> 06:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinations these vaccines are highly
 
06:02:21.310 --> 06:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
highly effective vaccinated people do
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
not carry the virus don't get sick
 
06:02:25.350 --> 06:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
they're really really good against
 
06:02:27.390 --> 06:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
variants everyone who takes the vaccine
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
is not just protecting themselves but
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
reducing their transmission uh to other
 
06:02:34.430 --> 06:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
people and allowing Society to get back
 
06:02:36.190 --> 06:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
to normal get your first sh shot and
 
06:02:37.390 --> 06:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
when you're due for your second you get
 
06:02:39.390 --> 06:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
your second shot a key goal is to stop
 
06:02:41.270 --> 06:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
the transmission to get the immunity
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
levels up so that you get almost no
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
almost no uh infection going on
 
06:02:48.510 --> 06:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever when people are vaccinated
 
06:02:50.070 --> 06:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
they can feel safe that they are not
 
06:02:52.110 --> 06:02:52.120 align:start position:0%
going to get infected if you're
 
06:02:53.990 --> 06:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you're not going to be
 
06:02:55.750 --> 06:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
hospitalized you're not going to be an
 
06:02:58.670 --> 06:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
IU unit and you're not going to die if
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
you are fully vaccinated you no longer
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
need to wear a mask anyone who is fully
 
06:03:07.868 --> 06:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
vaccinated can participate in indoor and
 
06:03:11.070 --> 06:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
outdoor activities large or small
 
06:03:13.030 --> 06:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
without wearing a mask or physical
 
06:03:14.788 --> 06:03:14.798 align:start position:0%
distancing but what they can't do
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
anymore is prevent transmission we
 
06:03:18.990 --> 06:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have vaccines that BL
 
06:03:21.628 --> 06:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
transmission we got
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines but they only
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
slightly we need a new way of the
 
06:03:31.390 --> 06:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine the level of virus in the n Bar
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
of a person who's vaccinated and
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
infected is the same level
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:44.670 --> 06:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
level sorry for the M dramatic music I
 
06:03:46.788 --> 06:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
like I said um but I think that that
 
06:03:48.788 --> 06:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
says it well and that fact you saw relle
 
06:03:50.990 --> 06:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
winsky in the middle there say what we
 
06:03:53.750 --> 06:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
had showed earlier um you know she said
 
06:03:55.310 --> 06:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
well what we know they can't stop
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
transmission and and there it is foui
 
06:03:59.390 --> 06:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
confirming what we saw in the study same
 
06:04:01.948 --> 06:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
amount of of a a virus in the naso
 
06:04:04.830 --> 06:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
fairings so what's incredible to me if
 
06:04:06.670 --> 06:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
there's a lesson to be we learn from
 
06:04:09.910 --> 06:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
from this is that these all these claims
 
06:04:13.030 --> 06:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
about uh you know uh Public Health we
 
06:04:16.350 --> 06:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
have to do it to uh protect the public
 
06:04:18.310 --> 06:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
transmission they should have known
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
early on it was unlikely to there was
 
06:04:23.150 --> 06:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's never been a respiratory virus I
 
06:04:24.788 --> 06:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
can think of that prevented transmission
 
06:04:26.628 --> 06:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
think about flu shot think about
 
06:04:28.990 --> 06:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
pertusus vaccine respiratory
 
06:04:31.270 --> 06:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
infections if you you know typically
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
they do not stop
 
06:04:35.708 --> 06:04:35.718 align:start position:0%
transmission and then um they could have
 
06:04:37.190 --> 06:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
done a trial that would have shown it
 
06:04:39.708 --> 06:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
stop transmission they didn't all the
 
06:04:41.548 --> 06:04:41.558 align:start position:0%
studies early on showed it didn't all
 
06:04:43.310 --> 06:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
the big studies showed it didn't stop
 
06:04:45.510 --> 06:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
transmission but yet with all that data
 
06:04:48.110 --> 06:04:48.120 align:start position:0%
in hand and even with them admitting it
 
06:04:49.750 --> 06:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
they went ahead with on the federal
 
06:04:51.468 --> 06:04:51.478 align:start position:0%
level the OSHA mandates the military
 
06:04:54.390 --> 06:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
mandates in the face of all of that it
 
06:04:58.670 --> 06:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
just shows you that um um you know
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh we can't con make civil rights
 
06:05:03.750 --> 06:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
individual rights the ability to
 
06:05:05.910 --> 06:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
participate in Civil Society contingent
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
on what public health authorities say um
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
that leads me to um a final few slides
 
06:05:13.468 --> 06:05:13.478 align:start position:0%
and uh you know the other argument and
 
06:05:15.948 --> 06:05:15.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go real quick because I it
 
06:05:18.830 --> 06:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit later I think um but
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
um the other argument that they made
 
06:05:22.430 --> 06:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
about covid-19 vaccine that if you don't
 
06:05:26.548 --> 06:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
get everybody will die right um we saw
 
06:05:28.270 --> 06:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
what the clinical trial data showed
 
06:05:30.030 --> 06:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
regarding deaths already and we've
 
06:05:32.430 --> 06:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
looked at the alla's mortality so you
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
know that already undercuts that entire
 
06:05:36.788 --> 06:05:36.798 align:start position:0%
argument but I I think it's also
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
instructive to look at again some of the
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
other vaccines on this point because
 
06:05:44.548 --> 06:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
they make the same Claim about other
 
06:05:46.708 --> 06:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines for example you know they say
 
06:05:48.350 --> 06:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
everybody's got to get a HPB vaccine to
 
06:05:51.190 --> 06:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
go to school well we foed the CDC
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
because we said hey hey can you can you
 
06:05:56.270 --> 06:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
give us one one documented case of
 
06:05:57.590 --> 06:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
hepatitis B being transmitted in a
 
06:05:59.590 --> 06:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
school setting you know Hepatitis B is
 
06:06:02.070 --> 06:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
typically transmitted by uh uh
 
06:06:03.948 --> 06:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
promiscuous sex workers and uh
 
06:06:06.270 --> 06:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
intravenous drug addicts who Ed
 
06:06:08.510 --> 06:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
needles not the kind of thing I'm I
 
06:06:10.110 --> 06:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
assume I don't know what goes on in New
 
06:06:12.190 --> 06:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire schools but I'm assuming
 
06:06:14.708 --> 06:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
that's not common and so we ask them for
 
06:06:17.990 --> 06:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
documents sufficient to reflect any any
 
06:06:20.310 --> 06:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
cases of transmission of in any in
 
06:06:22.350 --> 06:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
elementary middle or High School setting
 
06:06:24.628 --> 06:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
you know what the CDC told us a search
 
06:06:26.110 --> 06:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
of our records failed to reveal any
 
06:06:28.110 --> 06:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
documents pertaining to your request but
 
06:06:29.350 --> 06:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't stop them from the
 
06:06:31.468 --> 06:06:31.478 align:start position:0%
hysterics of what that everybody must
 
06:06:34.030 --> 06:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
get a hee vaccine to go to school or how
 
06:06:36.110 --> 06:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
about chickenpox virus
 
06:06:37.788 --> 06:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
here's what the package insert says for
 
06:06:40.750 --> 06:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
Chickenpox virus it says that the
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
transmission of vericella vaccine virus
 
06:06:45.990 --> 06:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
meaning the vaccine strain in the vial
 
06:06:48.150 --> 06:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
resulting in vericella infection
 
06:06:51.310 --> 06:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
including disseminated disease may occur
 
06:06:53.708 --> 06:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
meaning after you get the vaccine the
 
06:06:55.350 --> 06:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine virus that you've just gotten in
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
your arm
 
06:07:00.750 --> 06:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh between it can be transmitted
 
06:07:02.430 --> 06:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
between vaccine recipients who develop
 
06:07:04.830 --> 06:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
or do not develop a veracel like rash
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
meaning symptomatic ially or
 
06:07:08.150 --> 06:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
asymptomatically and contact susceptible
 
06:07:09.788 --> 06:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
to vericella including healthy as well
 
06:07:11.990 --> 06:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
as high-risk individuals due to the
 
06:07:13.868 --> 06:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
concern for transmission of vaccine
 
06:07:15.548 --> 06:07:15.558 align:start position:0%
virus vaccine recipient should attempt
 
06:07:17.708 --> 06:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
to avoid whenever possible close
 
06:07:19.150 --> 06:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
association with susceptible high-risk
 
06:07:20.948 --> 06:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
individuals for up to six weeks
 
06:07:23.110 --> 06:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
following vaccination with verax now
 
06:07:24.590 --> 06:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
Chickenpox vaccine is one of the few
 
06:07:25.948 --> 06:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
vaccines that actually can stop
 
06:07:28.830 --> 06:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
transmission to be sure it's not endemic
 
06:07:31.510 --> 06:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
anymore the chickenpox virus has receded
 
06:07:34.270 --> 06:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
from uh from society now a lot of people
 
06:07:35.628 --> 06:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
can argue whether that's a good or bad
 
06:07:36.590 --> 06:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
thing and I'll show you some studies
 
06:07:38.070 --> 06:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
that show maybe that wasn't a good thing
 
06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
there might have been a an evolutionary
 
06:07:43.270 --> 06:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
biological reason why we had chickenpox
 
06:07:46.548 --> 06:07:46.558 align:start position:0%
but the important thing here is that
 
06:07:48.150 --> 06:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
people who get the chickenpox vaccine
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
can can actually give it to high
 
06:07:51.750 --> 06:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
susceptible individuals according to the
 
06:07:54.430 --> 06:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
package insert but yet do we exclude
 
06:07:56.430 --> 06:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
children from
 
06:07:58.868 --> 06:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
school after for so six weeks after the
 
06:08:00.910 --> 06:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
get chicken boox vaccine of course not
 
06:08:02.670 --> 06:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
we don't do that you know why we don't
 
06:08:07.150 --> 06:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
do that because any child
 
06:08:08.830 --> 06:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
who could really be injured by
 
06:08:10.750 --> 06:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
chickenpox or measles or mums orella or
 
06:08:12.830 --> 06:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
whatever they're not in
 
06:08:15.868 --> 06:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
school if they're really that auto
 
06:08:18.310 --> 06:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
really that immuno compromised there's
 
06:08:23.510 --> 06:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
pathogens that means they you know the
 
06:08:28.468 --> 06:08:28.478 align:start position:0%
fact that they if they can be hangered
 
06:08:30.230 --> 06:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
by chickenpox they can be injured by any
 
06:08:33.990 --> 06:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
one of those um yes may um talking about
 
06:08:37.910 --> 06:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
the chickenpox vaccine so wouldn't you
 
06:08:42.110 --> 06:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
think that a school teacher who may be
 
06:08:45.310 --> 06:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
pregnant would be very concerned about
 
06:08:47.350 --> 06:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
the children as they may have just been
 
06:08:50.750 --> 06:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with the chickenpox vaccine I
 
06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't I think typically no because in
 
06:08:56.350 --> 06:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
the prevaccine era everybody would had
 
06:08:57.788 --> 06:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
chickenpox by the time they're they're
 
06:09:00.070 --> 06:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
pregnant so they would have robust
 
06:09:03.788 --> 06:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
complete immunity and and um and today
 
06:09:06.110 --> 06:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
they have to rely on either having had
 
06:09:08.110 --> 06:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
chickenpox um or having had the
 
06:09:08.120 --> 06:09:09.350 align:start position:0%
chickenpox um or having had the
chickenpox

06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
chickenpox
 
06:09:12.590 --> 06:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine I guess my question is is that
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
if they're shedding the virus it could
 
06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
affect the not if they're immune already
 
06:09:18.788 --> 06:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah if they're immune
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
then they shouldn't which is yeah which
 
06:09:23.150 --> 06:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
typically not a concern in fact all
 
06:09:25.750 --> 06:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant women are typically tested for
 
06:09:27.830 --> 06:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
immunity to those various so if they're
 
06:09:29.350 --> 06:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
not immune they would they should they
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
would typically know it
 
06:09:37.948 --> 06:09:37.958 align:start position:0%
um uh U that brings us to uh really the
 
06:09:39.868 --> 06:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
we've covered out every vaccine required
 
06:09:42.948 --> 06:09:42.958 align:start position:0%
in uh New Hampshire we did we did polio
 
06:09:45.468 --> 06:09:45.478 align:start position:0%
we did dap we did heppy and we did
 
06:09:47.948 --> 06:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
chickenpox that leaves us with just MMR
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you've heard this
 
06:09:51.390 --> 06:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to die without MMR
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine well let's take a look at the
 
06:09:55.948 --> 06:09:55.958 align:start position:0%
veracity of that
 
06:09:59.868 --> 06:09:59.878 align:start position:0%
claim um uh and see and I think it's
 
06:10:01.670 --> 06:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
instructive to how covid vaccines were
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
treated based on the CDC
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
data the First Co the first Chickenpox
 
06:10:09.230 --> 06:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine excuse me measles vaccine was in
 
06:10:12.190 --> 06:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
1963 and only around one in 500,000
 
06:10:13.510 --> 06:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
Americans died of measles when there was
 
06:10:15.468 --> 06:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
no vaccine 400 Americans on average a
 
06:10:18.788 --> 06:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
year died and the death rate between
 
06:10:21.788 --> 06:10:21.798 align:start position:0%
1900 and 1962 had declined by 98%
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
without any vaccine you know how I know
 
06:10:27.030 --> 06:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
that there was no vaccine so it couldn't
 
06:10:29.628 --> 06:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
have done that reduction um then you've
 
06:10:32.110 --> 06:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
got Ms and you rebella so you got a
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
grand total and to be sure every death
 
06:10:36.510 --> 06:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
is a tragedy
 
06:10:41.150 --> 06:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely but 440 deaths total for
 
06:10:43.390 --> 06:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
measles mums and rebella in the years
 
06:10:44.910 --> 06:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
before there was a year before there was
 
06:10:47.150 --> 06:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
a vaccine back when they were still
 
06:10:49.350 --> 06:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
doing labotomy okay back when Medical
 
06:10:51.110 --> 06:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
Care was still in its infancy acute care
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
was still being developed I mean I mean
 
06:10:55.510 --> 06:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's amazing because uh you know modern
 
06:10:57.390 --> 06:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
medicine it takes a lot of pride in the
 
06:10:59.910 --> 06:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
advances they've had since the 60s when
 
06:11:01.150 --> 06:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
it comes to vaccines they don't seem to
 
06:11:04.110 --> 06:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
want to recognize that not sure why um
 
06:11:05.830 --> 06:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
many of these folks probably would would
 
06:11:08.070 --> 06:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
be fine today if they had these
 
06:11:10.430 --> 06:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
conditions with that said it's far from
 
06:11:13.510 --> 06:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
the idea of everybody would die right
 
06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
they said hundreds of thousands died
 
06:11:21.310 --> 06:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
from covid 440 died they say a year 440
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
according CC dad had about a year again
 
06:11:27.230 --> 06:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
not to minimize any deaths but to put
 
06:11:29.750 --> 06:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to put it in context
 
06:11:31.590 --> 06:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
because that's not what they tell you
 
06:11:33.070 --> 06:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
that is not the impression they leave
 
06:11:34.868 --> 06:11:34.878 align:start position:0%
you with they don't leave the public
 
06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
with the Imp impression that only 400
 
06:11:37.670 --> 06:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
people here died of measles before there
 
06:11:39.150 --> 06:11:39.160 align:start position:0%
was a measles vaccine they leave you
 
06:11:40.548 --> 06:11:40.558 align:start position:0%
with the impression that Millions would
 
06:11:43.270 --> 06:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
die from measles and to be sure in thir
 
06:11:45.190 --> 06:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
World count developing countries where
 
06:11:47.110 --> 06:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
there's poor nutrition there's poor
 
06:11:49.270 --> 06:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
sanitation there's poor issues people
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
die kids die far more frequently of
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
measles as well as lots of other things
 
06:11:58.190 --> 06:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely and they still do even with
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the United
 
06:12:03.510 --> 06:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
States here's this is an official CDC
 
06:12:06.468 --> 06:12:06.478 align:start position:0%
chart by the way published in 1960 there
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
is no way this would get published in
 
06:12:11.670 --> 06:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
the postvaccine measles era okay but you
 
06:12:13.628 --> 06:12:13.638 align:start position:0%
know 1960 they weren't expecting the
 
06:12:15.948 --> 06:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine yet this is their own this is a
 
06:12:18.510 --> 06:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
CDC at least the predecessor of cdc's
 
06:12:20.628 --> 06:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
chart and you could see this is the
 
06:12:22.590 --> 06:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
standardized per 100,000 people the rate
 
06:12:25.390 --> 06:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
of measles mortality from 1900 until
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
1960 it went down over 98% without any
 
06:12:31.990 --> 06:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine again I I I I've had so many
 
06:12:33.708 --> 06:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
discussions with medical professionals
 
06:12:35.868 --> 06:12:35.878 align:start position:0%
and they just it's hard for them to
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
accept that reality but it just is and
 
06:12:39.150 --> 06:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to think the same
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
factors that cause a reduction and
 
06:12:42.590 --> 06:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
decline of mortality of measles between
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
19960 would not have continued I'm not
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
saying that maybe vaccines haven't saved
 
06:12:48.948 --> 06:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
some of those folks but some of the 400
 
06:12:51.468 --> 06:12:51.478 align:start position:0%
folks probably would have also not died
 
06:12:52.788 --> 06:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
based on the natural progression of
 
06:12:55.510 --> 06:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
where that disease was going as well um
 
06:12:56.750 --> 06:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
but that seems to be a hard thing to
 
06:12:58.670 --> 06:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
accept well what have we traded that off
 
06:13:02.830 --> 06:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
for okay things to consider um and and
 
06:13:04.270 --> 06:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
and you know this I think is also
 
06:13:06.390 --> 06:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
reflective Co vaccines they only look at
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
one side of the picture they don't want
 
06:13:11.190 --> 06:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
to look at the rest of it so for example
 
06:13:14.070 --> 06:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
here is a study a prospective study of a
 
06:13:16.948 --> 06:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
100,000 people in Japan only study of
 
06:13:19.070 --> 06:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
its kind I'm aware of and they track
 
06:13:22.430 --> 06:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
them forward-looking super reliable and
 
06:13:23.590 --> 06:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
what they looked at and this is
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
incredible finding Actually I don't even
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
know why they did this but they looked
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
at those who had measles and mons versus
 
06:13:30.910 --> 06:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
those that did not have measles and mums
 
06:13:32.510 --> 06:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
people who had measles and
 
06:13:36.628 --> 06:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
MPS um uh died far far less frequently
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
from cardiovascular issues statistically
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
significant to take a look at all the
 
06:13:42.468 --> 06:13:42.478 align:start position:0%
yellow statistically significant
 
06:13:44.670 --> 06:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
findings total cardiovascular disease
 
06:13:46.390 --> 06:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
and total stroke you are far less likely
 
06:13:47.708 --> 06:13:47.718 align:start position:0%
to have stroke and cardiovascular
 
06:13:49.990 --> 06:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
disease and die of it if you had measles
 
06:13:52.350 --> 06:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
and mums and if you didn't and you can't
 
06:13:54.430 --> 06:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
say well that's because people that meel
 
06:13:56.868 --> 06:13:56.878 align:start position:0%
mums died no there only a tiny number of
 
06:13:59.590 --> 06:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
them died cardiovascular disease kills
 
06:14:03.310 --> 06:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
700,000 Americans a year if having
 
06:14:06.110 --> 06:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
measles and Ms of eliminating that
 
06:14:07.948 --> 06:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
increased the number of deaths of
 
06:14:11.190 --> 06:14:11.200 align:start position:0%
cardiovasculares by 2% well you you just
 
06:14:12.468 --> 06:14:12.478 align:start position:0%
went upside down in terms of the
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
benefits of this product I'm not saying
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's the case that's I'm not saying
 
06:14:18.430 --> 06:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
that's good science what I just did I am
 
06:14:21.190 --> 06:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
saying though that if you look at this
 
06:14:24.868 --> 06:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
this study by mainstream researchers in
 
06:14:29.670 --> 06:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
Japan looking at a huge cohort found an
 
06:14:32.230 --> 06:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
incredible reduction I mean when you
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
look at measles and Ms you are
 
06:14:36.750 --> 06:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
I mean and you can look at the if you
 
06:14:39.310 --> 06:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
look at the uh those two line curves and
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
you could see the percentage of folks of
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
the men for example after 22 years you
 
06:14:47.628 --> 06:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
could see that about 5% of those that
 
06:14:49.948 --> 06:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
had measles and Ms died of
 
06:14:51.750 --> 06:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease but something
 
06:14:54.030 --> 06:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
like 15% of them died from
 
06:14:55.868 --> 06:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular disease that didn't have
 
06:15:00.110 --> 06:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
it incredible finding but it doesn't fit
 
06:15:02.708 --> 06:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
the policy never seen a study that
 
06:15:04.990 --> 06:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
contradicts this never seen a study
 
06:15:07.750 --> 06:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
bunked so to speak because it's nothing
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
to do with vaccines really they just
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
happens to be out there in the world
 
06:15:14.190 --> 06:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
really troubling though for those who
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
the proponents is and this is a huge
 
06:15:19.910 --> 06:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
body of science back when all of these
 
06:15:21.628 --> 06:15:21.638 align:start position:0%
in childhood infectious diseases and
 
06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
maybe God put them on the planet for a
 
06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
reason or being you know eliminated like
 
06:15:27.430 --> 06:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
I said measles mumer Bell and Chickenpox
 
06:15:29.708 --> 06:15:29.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine they can stop transmission so
 
06:15:31.628 --> 06:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
they do end up reducing the amount of
 
06:15:34.548 --> 06:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
circulating virus for those four viruses
 
06:15:36.628 --> 06:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
as the viruses were seeded and children
 
06:15:38.708 --> 06:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have those infections these
 
06:15:41.190 --> 06:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
studies looked at the rates of childhood
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
cancers for example 66% increase rate in
 
06:15:47.910 --> 06:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
non-hot lyoma and 233% increase rate of
 
06:15:50.750 --> 06:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
hodkin lyoma amongst children that did
 
06:15:54.590 --> 06:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
not have measles according to um the
 
06:15:56.830 --> 06:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
international Agency for research and
 
06:15:59.030 --> 06:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
cancer um and then you can look through
 
06:16:01.270 --> 06:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
it in ovarian cancer double the rate of
 
06:16:03.110 --> 06:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
those who didn't have measles and so
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
forth it's true of of and what they find
 
06:16:07.830 --> 06:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
these studies are they're consistent and
 
06:16:09.670 --> 06:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
they were all done often back in the '
 
06:16:11.510 --> 06:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
80s and and then they stopped doing them
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
and they're sitting there in Pub Med but
 
06:16:15.548 --> 06:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
they don't fit the narrative and what
 
06:16:18.190 --> 06:16:18.200 align:start position:0%
they show is that ferbal childhood
 
06:16:19.708 --> 06:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
infections meaning childhood infections
 
06:16:21.750 --> 06:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
like of those that have fever for
 
06:16:25.230 --> 06:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
whatever reason afford protection later
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
based on these studies from various
 
06:16:29.670 --> 06:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
Cancers and other cardiovascular disease
 
06:16:31.948 --> 06:16:31.958 align:start position:0%
and other issues I'm not saying this
 
06:16:34.110 --> 06:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
just to be clear this is that's what
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
these studies
 
06:16:39.510 --> 06:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
all reflect there might be a reason that
 
06:16:42.070 --> 06:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
while for example certain viruses and
 
06:16:44.110 --> 06:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
bacteria come and go throughout history
 
06:16:46.110 --> 06:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
when you look back on human history lots
 
06:16:47.548 --> 06:16:47.558 align:start position:0%
of virus bacteria they come and they're
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
gone these particular ones have been
 
06:16:53.190 --> 06:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
with us for for forever and might be an
 
06:16:55.910 --> 06:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
evolutionary biological reason that
 
06:16:57.110 --> 06:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
they've been here because they might
 
06:16:58.948 --> 06:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
actually help increase life ins
 
06:17:03.310 --> 06:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
expectancy potentially um you
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
know you know
 
06:17:06.948 --> 06:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
there's no reason I think that somebody
 
06:17:08.430 --> 06:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be able to look at this data
 
06:17:12.310 --> 06:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
and make a a health decision um and and
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
and and and have a a reasonable
 
06:17:16.030 --> 06:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about this I mean I think it
 
06:17:18.190 --> 06:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful to have um one side
 
06:17:20.110 --> 06:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
of folks come and present the studies
 
06:17:22.590 --> 06:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
that debunk these and this and and and
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
the one side that looks at these studies
 
06:17:25.150 --> 06:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
because the body of
 
06:17:28.030 --> 06:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
literature I've not seen a body of
 
06:17:29.150 --> 06:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
literature that contradicts these
 
06:17:31.868 --> 06:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
findings and so you know when you talk
 
06:17:34.150 --> 06:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
about saving 400 something Folks by
 
06:17:36.468 --> 06:17:36.478 align:start position:0%
getting rid of these diseases you might
 
06:17:39.548 --> 06:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
have ended up causing far more death
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
through uh cancer heart disease and so
 
06:17:44.390 --> 06:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
forth is the balance worth it the the
 
06:17:46.030 --> 06:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
problem is that I'm just a lawyer I
 
06:17:49.350 --> 06:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing that analysis yeah
 
06:17:51.628 --> 06:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
but Public Health authori should but
 
06:17:53.468 --> 06:17:53.478 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do that I I can
 
06:17:56.110 --> 06:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
assure you I there are things that is a
 
06:17:57.548 --> 06:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
speculation I'm willing to walk on a
 
06:17:59.468 --> 06:17:59.478 align:start position:0%
Ledge on and say the FDA is not going to
 
06:18:01.150 --> 06:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
do that and CDC is not going to do that
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
analysis and I don't and and if you can
 
06:18:05.110 --> 06:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
get your State Department of Health do w
 
06:18:08.150 --> 06:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful um so
 
06:18:10.590 --> 06:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
um and and you might say well you know
 
06:18:12.468 --> 06:18:12.478 align:start position:0%
the MMR has been carefully reviewed and
 
06:18:15.510 --> 06:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
studied has it really I mean we've
 
06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
already done we've already looked at
 
06:18:19.750 --> 06:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
this issue we just take a super quick
 
06:18:21.910 --> 06:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
peek here's the clinical trial relied
 
06:18:24.948 --> 06:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
upon to license the MMR vaccine 834
 
06:18:27.830 --> 06:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
children not properly powered no control
 
06:18:30.310 --> 06:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
42 days of safety riew and by the way a
 
06:18:31.910 --> 06:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
third had gastrointestinal issues and a
 
06:18:33.150 --> 06:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
third had respiratory issues in the
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
trial I don't know what the point of
 
06:18:36.150 --> 06:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
doing that trial was similar trial for
 
06:18:38.830 --> 06:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
the 1971 original version um when they
 
06:18:40.430 --> 06:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
licensed the 71 version which is
 
06:18:41.830 --> 06:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
basically the same as the 78 version
 
06:18:42.990 --> 06:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
except they changed out the rebella
 
06:18:45.590 --> 06:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
component okay um this is what I was
 
06:18:47.030 --> 06:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
telling you earlier here's the by the
 
06:18:48.390 --> 06:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
way the vaccine information sheet from
 
06:18:51.150 --> 06:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
Mel Ms rebella it includes a disclosure
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
such as seizures deafness long-term
 
06:18:55.788 --> 06:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
seizures coma lodis and brain damage but
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh they took they got rid of that now
 
06:19:01.510 --> 06:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
because you know uh so anyway um and
 
06:19:03.150 --> 06:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
these are all remember we looked at this
 
06:19:04.548 --> 06:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
these are all the conditions that are
 
06:19:07.190 --> 06:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
just disclosed that um the manufacturer
 
06:19:09.110 --> 06:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
say can be caused very serious
 
06:19:11.350 --> 06:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
conditions um separate from the cancer
 
06:19:12.868 --> 06:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
stuff separate from the heart disease
 
06:19:14.670 --> 06:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
stuff these are the ones they have a
 
06:19:16.910 --> 06:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
causal basis to
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
include and this is my favorite slide in
 
06:19:21.310 --> 06:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
MMR and then we'll move on to another
 
06:19:25.350 --> 06:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
topic is is that there was only one MMR
 
06:19:27.510 --> 06:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine for Forever by Merc with that
 
06:19:28.830 --> 06:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
clinical Tri just showed you that which
 
06:19:30.468 --> 06:19:30.478 align:start position:0%
was underpowered no control and not
 
06:19:31.670 --> 06:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
enough safety
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
review well glos Smith k finally they
 
06:19:37.110 --> 06:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
went and they licensed an mrr vaccine
 
06:19:38.430 --> 06:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
well what did they use as a control in
 
06:19:41.350 --> 06:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
the study they used the Merk vaccine so
 
06:19:44.270 --> 06:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
we finally could see what is the adverse
 
06:19:46.230 --> 06:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
event rate amongst the healthy childhood
 
06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
population of getting these products
 
06:19:50.788 --> 06:19:50.798 align:start position:0%
buried in a supplemental table not in
 
06:19:54.350 --> 06:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
the primary study it's right here okay
 
06:19:58.270 --> 06:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
so you could see that serious Adverse
 
06:20:00.868 --> 06:20:00.878 align:start position:0%
Events amongst those getting
 
06:20:05.150 --> 06:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
mmit and mmr2 so mmit is the GSK version
 
06:20:09.150 --> 06:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
two is the MC version 2 around 2% had a
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
serious adverse event but here's an
 
06:20:11.948 --> 06:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
interesting thing by the way I've never
 
06:20:15.350 --> 06:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
seen this before this is they took uh
 
06:20:18.468 --> 06:20:18.478 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events prompting an ER visit and
 
06:20:21.430 --> 06:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
nods this is a new thing new onc chronic
 
06:20:25.270 --> 06:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
disease they remove those from serious
 
06:20:28.548 --> 06:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
Adverse Events I don't know why so you
 
06:20:30.150 --> 06:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
got to look at all three of them and and
 
06:20:32.430 --> 06:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
and add them up cumulatively okay so
 
06:20:34.110 --> 06:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
you've got 2% with the series have ver
 
06:20:35.110 --> 06:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
event we looked to what those are
 
06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
earlier those are serious you have
 
06:20:39.868 --> 06:20:39.878 align:start position:0%
another 10% that needed an ER visit
 
06:20:41.190 --> 06:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
prompted from the vaccine and you had
 
06:20:44.548 --> 06:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
another three about 3.4% that had a new
 
06:20:47.548 --> 06:20:47.558 align:start position:0%
onset chronic disease during this the
 
06:20:51.990 --> 06:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the um uh uh during the uh review
 
06:20:53.788 --> 06:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
period for the vaccine which was
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
unsolicited 42 days and then AES were
 
06:21:01.788 --> 06:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
done for 180 days so uh you know I mean
 
06:21:03.548 --> 06:21:03.558 align:start position:0%
to me that's that should be really
 
06:21:06.750 --> 06:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
concerning if every few months every
 
06:21:08.990 --> 06:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
child 3.4% of children in America had a
 
06:21:12.548 --> 06:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
chronic disease that arose every person
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
America would have a chronic disease
 
06:21:17.788 --> 06:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
over a longer enough period of time
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
so anyways I'm not looking to you know
 
06:21:24.788 --> 06:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
cast dispersions on on on on
 
06:21:28.628 --> 06:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
um on the MMR vaccine I'm really
 
06:21:32.270 --> 06:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
just just pointing out that in the same
 
06:21:34.190 --> 06:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
way that the federal health authorities
 
06:21:36.990 --> 06:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
do not have any issue in my
 
06:21:39.510 --> 06:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
opinion giving an impression of what
 
06:21:42.390 --> 06:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
these products can do how harmful they
 
06:21:43.830 --> 06:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
were before there was a vaccine and
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
misleading the public with regards to
 
06:21:48.070 --> 06:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
MMR vaccine I don't think they have an
 
06:21:49.510 --> 06:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
issue misleading the public regards to
 
06:21:51.110 --> 06:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine I think it's kind of
 
06:21:54.708 --> 06:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
the same type of approach I I I I should
 
06:21:57.030 --> 06:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
say for what it's worth I think most
 
06:21:58.270 --> 06:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
public health authorities and medical
 
06:22:00.310 --> 06:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
professionals are well-meaning I think
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
that they really they they believe that
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
they are um um you know they don't know
 
06:22:07.708 --> 06:22:07.718 align:start position:0%
they just they have assumptions about
 
06:22:08.910 --> 06:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
these products they're well- meaning
 
06:22:11.628 --> 06:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
they think that they are uh they really
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
need to no matter what get you to take
 
06:22:15.350 --> 06:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
it because that's going to save
 
06:22:17.548 --> 06:22:17.558 align:start position:0%
everybody but you know when you step
 
06:22:18.868 --> 06:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
back and you're not emotional or
 
06:22:20.230 --> 06:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
religious about these products and
 
06:22:22.628 --> 06:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
you're just look at the data they paint
 
06:22:24.628 --> 06:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
a very different picture and it's
 
06:22:26.548 --> 06:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we can't have those
 
06:22:27.910 --> 06:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
kind of objective
 
06:22:31.190 --> 06:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
discussions um and so um you know as I
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
point out same hysterics apply to
 
06:22:35.708 --> 06:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine I say you know I'll say
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
it again everyone should be free to get
 
06:22:39.430 --> 06:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
one uh government should be free to
 
06:22:41.510 --> 06:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
persuade the public but when they
 
06:22:45.390 --> 06:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
can't that's where it ends and think
 
06:22:47.788 --> 06:22:47.798 align:start position:0%
about it after all did our government
 
06:22:49.150 --> 06:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
tell us the
 
06:22:52.390 --> 06:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
truth about the deaths in the clinical
 
06:22:56.190 --> 06:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
trial of covid-19 vaccines no I I don't
 
06:22:58.190 --> 06:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
think they went and publicized that at
 
06:23:01.390 --> 06:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
all remember here it is again this this
 
06:23:06.430 --> 06:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
this this this yeah
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
um uh conflicted Regulators I feel like
 
06:23:10.830 --> 06:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
we've really covered this pretty well so
 
06:23:12.468 --> 06:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
I'll just go super quick who's
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
responsible for vaccine safety not
 
06:23:16.548 --> 06:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies they're immune
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
so all of that responsibility was
 
06:23:20.310 --> 06:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
transferred over the the Secretary of
 
06:23:23.510 --> 06:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
HHS it's actually included in one
 
06:23:25.390 --> 06:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
section of the United States code this
 
06:23:27.310 --> 06:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
was part of the 1986 act it's called
 
06:23:29.708 --> 06:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
literally mandate for safer childhood
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines that's what it's called it's
 
06:23:33.990 --> 06:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
got three simple sections section one
 
06:23:36.350 --> 06:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
make them safer section two form a task
 
06:23:38.948 --> 06:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
force the head of the FDA CDC NIH and
 
06:23:41.628 --> 06:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to the head of HHS
 
06:23:43.548 --> 06:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
and how to make them safer in section
 
06:23:45.510 --> 06:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
three every two years submit a report to
 
06:23:47.390 --> 06:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
Congress describing how you made him
 
06:23:50.548 --> 06:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
safer okay well guess what let's let's
 
06:23:52.910 --> 06:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
work backwards did they submit that
 
06:23:54.510 --> 06:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
biannual report to Congress is required
 
06:23:57.230 --> 06:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
by section c never once we sued them
 
06:23:58.150 --> 06:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't give us any of
 
06:24:00.150 --> 06:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
their reports never once have they
 
06:24:02.110 --> 06:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
submitted this ban report to Congress as
 
06:24:03.868 --> 06:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
required by the Mandate for Savor
 
06:24:06.310 --> 06:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
childhood section c how about section
 
06:24:08.030 --> 06:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
Department search did not loc at any
 
06:24:11.310 --> 06:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
records how about the task force well
 
06:24:13.990 --> 06:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
again we sued them the task force was
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
disbanded in 1998 so they had it for a
 
06:24:18.310 --> 06:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
while but it doesn't exist so they're
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
not doing the easy stuff if they don't
 
06:24:21.910 --> 06:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
if they're not submitting the biannual
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
report to Congress and they don't have a
 
06:24:24.830 --> 06:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
task for on how to make it safer you
 
06:24:25.910 --> 06:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
think they're doing the hard part of
 
06:24:27.110 --> 06:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
actually making it safe dur under
 
06:24:29.670 --> 06:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
Section A I think the presentation up to
 
06:24:31.310 --> 06:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
this point probably answers that
 
06:24:34.430 --> 06:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
question why did they abandon safety uh
 
06:24:37.150 --> 06:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
I would argue to do because they are
 
06:24:39.910 --> 06:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
conflicted they're utterly conflicted
 
06:24:42.270 --> 06:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
they're responsible promoting vaccines
 
06:24:45.030 --> 06:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
as well as safety so you know when the
 
06:24:46.230 --> 06:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation was
 
06:24:48.190 --> 06:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for promoting Transportation
 
06:24:49.788 --> 06:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
they said oh wait you can't also be
 
06:24:51.390 --> 06:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for investigating disasters
 
06:24:53.510 --> 06:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
because you can't like be glab handing
 
06:24:55.590 --> 06:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
with industry like go make more planes
 
06:24:57.628 --> 06:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
go fly more routes and then say oh
 
06:24:59.590 --> 06:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
you're very bad and what you right so
 
06:25:01.270 --> 06:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
they created the national Transportation
 
06:25:03.070 --> 06:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
safety board they separate the promotion
 
06:25:04.830 --> 06:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
from the safety function same thing with
 
06:25:07.548 --> 06:25:07.558 align:start position:0%
energy Department of energy promotes
 
06:25:09.030 --> 06:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy power plants to be
 
06:25:11.430 --> 06:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
created the nuclear Regulatory
 
06:25:13.948 --> 06:25:13.958 align:start position:0%
Commission regulates their safety I
 
06:25:15.350 --> 06:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
can't walk into nuclear power plant and
 
06:25:16.830 --> 06:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
say build more power plants hey buddy
 
06:25:18.230 --> 06:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
how you doing you know slap them in the
 
06:25:19.468 --> 06:25:19.478 align:start position:0%
back give them incentiv and then and
 
06:25:21.750 --> 06:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
then slap them around when they not safe
 
06:25:23.628 --> 06:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
but with vaccines we keep them in the
 
06:25:27.150 --> 06:25:27.160 align:start position:0%
very same they're both within HHS okay
 
06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
so one of them is going to win out and
 
06:25:32.990 --> 06:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
the promotion function wins out but if
 
06:25:35.670 --> 06:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
that weren't bad enough
 
06:25:37.750 --> 06:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier the 1986 Act
 
06:25:39.390 --> 06:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
created a vaccine injury Compensation
 
06:25:42.070 --> 06:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
Program where you Sue there it is the
 
06:25:43.868 --> 06:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
quote from the law in all proceedings
 
06:25:45.590 --> 06:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
brought by the filing of a petition of
 
06:25:46.948 --> 06:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine Court the secretary shall be
 
06:25:49.230 --> 06:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
named as the respond the Secretary of H
 
06:25:51.030 --> 06:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're literally suing federal health
 
06:25:52.590 --> 06:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
authorities for vaccine injury they're
 
06:25:54.830 --> 06:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to defend against
 
06:25:56.910 --> 06:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
any claim that a vaccine causes injury
 
06:25:58.788 --> 06:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
if they create any studies that show a
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine causes injury is an admission
 
06:26:02.310 --> 06:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
against interest is the most incredible
 
06:26:04.590 --> 06:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
conflict you could imagine enough you
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
got rid of Market forces you have
 
06:26:08.310 --> 06:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
utterly conflicted The Regulators and if
 
06:26:09.590 --> 06:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
that weren't bad enough there's a
 
06:26:12.750 --> 06:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
revolving door between regulators and
 
06:26:14.830 --> 06:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
Pharma it's all over the internet you
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
could look at it all the former heads of
 
06:26:18.830 --> 06:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
the CDC and FDA and regulators and where
 
06:26:20.070 --> 06:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
they work now and where they're getting
 
06:26:22.230 --> 06:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
paid and obviously we have that
 
06:26:24.990 --> 06:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
government report um in terms of covid
 
06:26:26.548 --> 06:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine one more thing I would point out
 
06:26:29.788 --> 06:26:29.798 align:start position:0%
in that regard is that um I mentioned
 
06:26:31.948 --> 06:26:31.958 align:start position:0%
the vaccine injur Compensation Program
 
06:26:34.750 --> 06:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
that at least offers some Moda
 
06:26:37.270 --> 06:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
of compensation for those injured by
 
06:26:38.708 --> 06:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines even though you have to fight
 
06:26:40.590 --> 06:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
the doj you don't get article three
 
06:26:42.548 --> 06:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
judge you get a special Master you don't
 
06:26:44.150 --> 06:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
get any Discovery as a right I can't
 
06:26:45.548 --> 06:26:45.558 align:start position:0%
depose any of the farm companies I can't
 
06:26:47.590 --> 06:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
get Discovery so you know you fight with
 
06:26:49.070 --> 06:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
your hands behind your back against
 
06:26:50.830 --> 06:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice that gets full
 
06:26:52.990 --> 06:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
discover gets everything that they want
 
06:26:54.910 --> 06:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of experts nonetheless they've
 
06:26:57.230 --> 06:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
paid out over $4 billion in Damages with
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
a $250,000 cap in pain and suffering and
 
06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
for death claims but when it comes to
 
06:27:04.390 --> 06:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine injury
 
06:27:06.750 --> 06:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to covid vaccine injury
 
06:27:08.750 --> 06:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
basically there's all you the only
 
06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
remedy right now is the counter injury
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
Compensation Program who is the try or
 
06:27:14.590 --> 06:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
effect that's really deciding your claim
 
06:27:16.830 --> 06:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
you do not know what is exactly the
 
06:27:18.590 --> 06:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
standard not sure who's the expert
 
06:27:20.310 --> 06:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
they're going rely upon you don't know
 
06:27:21.868 --> 06:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
can you confront them no is there a
 
06:27:25.590 --> 06:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
hearing no is there any due process no
 
06:27:27.270 --> 06:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
it is the equivalent of fill out a piece
 
06:27:30.110 --> 06:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
of paper go to your backyard dig a hole
 
06:27:32.150 --> 06:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
put it in the ground cover it up water
 
06:27:33.430 --> 06:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
it and wait for money to grow I mean
 
06:27:35.590 --> 06:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what the cicp is
 
06:27:37.590 --> 06:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
we've already sued uh this we've sued in
 
06:27:39.150 --> 06:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
federal court we right now in Louisiana
 
06:27:40.868 --> 06:27:40.878 align:start position:0%
and in Texas to declare it
 
06:27:43.150 --> 06:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because you know when
 
06:27:45.670 --> 06:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
you afford a remedy of some kind right a
 
06:27:47.230 --> 06:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
process it's got to meet basic
 
06:27:49.270 --> 06:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional due process if you don't
 
06:27:51.230 --> 06:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
know who the triy f you don't get a
 
06:27:53.868 --> 06:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
hearing you can't confront who's making
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
the decision you can't rebut their
 
06:27:57.230 --> 06:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
evidence I mean it's the
 
06:27:59.310 --> 06:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
most I cannot think of something more
 
06:28:01.468 --> 06:28:01.478 align:start position:0%
offensive to do process you basically
 
06:28:03.788 --> 06:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
submit something and you just wait how
 
06:28:05.830 --> 06:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
long indefinite you have no idea oh you
 
06:28:07.110 --> 06:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
only have one year to file but they can
 
06:28:09.070 --> 06:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
take five years to decide your claim and
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
to date they since they only have a few
 
06:28:13.468 --> 06:28:13.478 align:start position:0%
million dollars by the way you don't
 
06:28:15.510 --> 06:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
have any you have no chance of getting
 
06:28:17.390 --> 06:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
any real compensation they've
 
06:28:19.390 --> 06:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
adjudicated only a tiny fraction of the
 
06:28:21.590 --> 06:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
cams and they've only agreed to
 
06:28:24.350 --> 06:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
compensate even I forgot some tiny tiny
 
06:28:25.830 --> 06:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
percent and each of them got about an
 
06:28:27.548 --> 06:28:27.558 align:start position:0%
average of a few thousand do for
 
06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
devastating lifelong injuries that's
 
06:28:32.548 --> 06:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
what the cicp program is it's designed
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's basically a policy
 
06:28:35.868 --> 06:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
organization our hope is to strike it
 
06:28:39.270 --> 06:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
down and we um and and U and and I think
 
06:28:40.868 --> 06:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
that I'm hopeful that we'll be able to
 
06:28:43.510 --> 06:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:45.990 --> 06:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional okay so
 
06:28:48.910 --> 06:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
um uh this brings us to the last part
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
which is the idea of inform consent and
 
06:28:53.150 --> 06:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
I think this really to me wraps and
 
06:28:54.868 --> 06:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
wraps everything we've talked about
 
06:28:58.430 --> 06:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
today uh and uh
 
06:29:01.510 --> 06:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
um which is what is informed
 
06:29:04.708 --> 06:29:04.718 align:start position:0%
consent and to me this is It's it's the
 
06:29:07.110 --> 06:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
lack of respect for this basic principle
 
06:29:08.590 --> 06:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
that led to so many of the issues if
 
06:29:10.270 --> 06:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
they didn't mandate masks and stay at
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
home and vaccines and this stuff I don't
 
06:29:14.670 --> 06:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
think you'd be having this hearing
 
06:29:16.510 --> 06:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
persuade folks tell them they do if they
 
06:29:18.310 --> 06:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
want to do it great if you're 90 years
 
06:29:20.390 --> 06:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
old and you have a million comorbidities
 
06:29:21.708 --> 06:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
and you want to still go to the coffee
 
06:29:23.590 --> 06:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
shop it's America you should be able to
 
06:29:26.708 --> 06:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
do it you're 16 and you're 18 and you're
 
06:29:28.270 --> 06:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
totally healthy and you want to live in
 
06:29:30.270 --> 06:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
your basement and wear seven masks and
 
06:29:32.150 --> 06:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinate every day you should be able
 
06:29:34.030 --> 06:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
to do that too because that's freedom
 
06:29:34.040 --> 06:29:36.590 align:start position:0%
to do that too because that's freedom
this

06:29:36.590 --> 06:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:39.548 --> 06:29:39.558 align:start position:0%
America informed consent is where you
 
06:29:41.230 --> 06:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
get informed to whatever degree the
 
06:29:43.030 --> 06:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
doctor is going to give you then you
 
06:29:46.350 --> 06:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
decide whether to consent and that's it
 
06:29:47.708 --> 06:29:47.718 align:start position:0%
that's what it should
 
06:29:50.990 --> 06:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
be saying I don't consent but now you
 
06:29:52.628 --> 06:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
can't get a job and you can't go to
 
06:29:54.868 --> 06:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
school you can't go in the military you
 
06:29:56.788 --> 06:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
can't go in public transport what the
 
06:29:59.628 --> 06:29:59.638 align:start position:0%
heck is that that's not informed consent
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's I'm going to inform you and you
 
06:30:03.830 --> 06:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
better consent or else that's what that
 
06:30:05.868 --> 06:30:05.878 align:start position:0%
is is that's not informed consent that's
 
06:30:08.670 --> 06:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
not Freedom seven basic questions that
 
06:30:11.468 --> 06:30:11.478 align:start position:0%
you would ask I think in my opinion
 
06:30:13.430 --> 06:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
before you decide whether you should do
 
06:30:15.110 --> 06:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
a medical intervention and that the
 
06:30:16.948 --> 06:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
government should respect your right to
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
do one is will the manufacturer stand
 
06:30:22.750 --> 06:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
behind its product does the manufacturer
 
06:30:24.990 --> 06:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
stand behind his product and on this um
 
06:30:26.750 --> 06:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
thing there are links where you can see
 
06:30:28.708 --> 06:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
which vaccines are covered by the 86 act
 
06:30:30.390 --> 06:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
which are covered by the pra act and a
 
06:30:31.628 --> 06:30:31.638 align:start position:0%
letter you can send to your
 
06:30:32.990 --> 06:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company asking them to
 
06:30:34.910 --> 06:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
wave that immunity because if they won't
 
06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
stand behind their product do you think
 
06:30:39.190 --> 06:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
it's wise to inject it in your
 
06:30:42.350 --> 06:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
body I don't know some people don't and
 
06:30:43.510 --> 06:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
they should be free to make that
 
06:30:45.430 --> 06:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
determination in this country and say
 
06:30:47.190 --> 06:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know what if the makers of this
 
06:30:49.310 --> 06:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
product won't stand behind it and
 
06:30:51.230 --> 06:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
compensate me if I'm injured why should
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
I take that
 
06:30:56.468 --> 06:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
risk two did his clinical trial prove it
 
06:30:58.788 --> 06:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
was safe we' looked at that pretty
 
06:31:01.310 --> 06:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
closely I should be able to say that's
 
06:31:03.510 --> 06:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
not good enough to inject that product
 
06:31:05.388 --> 06:31:05.398 align:start position:0%
into me or or my child with that kind of
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
data I want a better trial and until you
 
06:31:10.350 --> 06:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
do it
 
06:31:12.670 --> 06:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
no did the post relationship studies
 
06:31:14.830 --> 06:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
prove it safe we reviewed that same
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
principle should be able to look at that
 
06:31:19.670 --> 06:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'm educated enough to look at Pub Med
 
06:31:21.948 --> 06:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
and read the studies you know I
 
06:31:23.150 --> 06:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even say educated enough
 
06:31:25.590 --> 06:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
they're in English anybody can read them
 
06:31:27.590 --> 06:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
anybody can figure this stuff out I
 
06:31:30.350 --> 06:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
should able to say no without penalty
 
06:31:32.030 --> 06:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
are the benefits what are the benefits
 
06:31:33.310 --> 06:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
prob be able to look at them and decide
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's not for me
 
06:31:36.990 --> 06:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason can you determine if
 
06:31:38.948 --> 06:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
the risks outweigh the benefits well if
 
06:31:40.388 --> 06:31:40.398 align:start position:0%
you don't know the safety profile how do
 
06:31:42.590 --> 06:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
you do that and a lot of product these
 
06:31:43.830 --> 06:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
products you don't know the safety
 
06:31:45.468 --> 06:31:45.478 align:start position:0%
profile and I should be able to say I
 
06:31:47.110 --> 06:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
don't want it on that basis alone
 
06:31:50.070 --> 06:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the benefits are till I know
 
06:31:51.788 --> 06:31:51.798 align:start position:0%
the real risk profile I should be able
 
06:31:54.590 --> 06:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
to say no without penalty can you trust
 
06:31:56.590 --> 06:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
the people recommending the product can
 
06:31:58.590 --> 06:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
you trust Dr Peter marks at the FDA
 
06:32:00.510 --> 06:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
who's going out making just a minute
 
06:32:02.590 --> 06:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
everybody get the shot before it's even
 
06:32:05.310 --> 06:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
authorized don't worry I won't have
 
06:32:06.628 --> 06:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
cognitive distance if I not tell you
 
06:32:08.350 --> 06:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
oopsie I just told you to take a shot
 
06:32:11.670 --> 06:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
that hurts you or how about Dr Edwards
 
06:32:14.110 --> 06:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
who's on the vaccinologist in the dsnb
 
06:32:16.388 --> 06:32:16.398 align:start position:0%
who was a fiser consultant adviser right
 
06:32:18.310 --> 06:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
before she was on the
 
06:32:21.230 --> 06:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
dsnb or look or the members of the
 
06:32:23.110 --> 06:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that you know
 
06:32:25.430 --> 06:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
numerous reports Congress and other
 
06:32:27.670 --> 06:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
reports have found are conflicted I
 
06:32:29.310 --> 06:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to say you know
 
06:32:31.388 --> 06:32:31.398 align:start position:0%
what I'm not sure I trust those
 
06:32:34.190 --> 06:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations without penalty
 
06:32:36.270 --> 06:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe you have a moral objection to
 
06:32:37.868 --> 06:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
the product I'll show you one more video
 
06:32:40.230 --> 06:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm pretty much done um so you might
 
06:32:42.190 --> 06:32:42.200 align:start position:0%
say listen I don't want to participate I
 
06:32:44.388 --> 06:32:44.398 align:start position:0%
believe abortion is murder some people
 
06:32:46.190 --> 06:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
think that some people don't it's
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
America is free to their opinion and for
 
06:32:49.590 --> 06:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
those who think that maybe they don't
 
06:32:52.150 --> 06:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
want to participate in products that
 
06:32:55.388 --> 06:32:55.398 align:start position:0%
involve abortion so let's take a look at
 
06:32:58.270 --> 06:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
one video for it's a few minutes exactly
 
06:32:58.280 --> 06:32:59.628 align:start position:0%
one video for it's a few minutes exactly
that

06:32:59.628 --> 06:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:33:03.150 --> 06:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
topic your work related to vaccines how
 
06:33:06.190 --> 06:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
many fetus have been part of that
 
06:33:09.990 --> 06:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
work my own personal work too I'm going
 
06:33:11.150 --> 06:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
to hand you what's been marked
 
06:33:18.030 --> 06:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:30.270 --> 06:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:34.230 --> 06:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
Dr yes are you listed as and all on this
 
06:33:34.240 --> 06:33:38.708 align:start position:0%
Dr yes are you listed as and all on this
article

06:33:38.708 --> 06:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
yes this study took place at The wiar
 
06:33:43.830 --> 06:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
Institute correct
 
06:33:47.270 --> 06:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes starts to correct
 
06:33:50.510 --> 06:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes how many fetuses were used in the
 
06:33:53.430 --> 06:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
study described in this article uh quite
 
06:33:55.388 --> 06:33:55.398 align:start position:0%
a few
 
06:33:59.590 --> 06:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
so this study involved 74 ft is
 
06:34:02.030 --> 06:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct I don't remember exactly how
 
06:34:09.948 --> 06:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
study you 76
 
06:34:18.628 --> 06:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
76 and um these fuses uh were all three
 
06:34:20.788 --> 06:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
months or older when AB boarded correct
 
06:34:22.750 --> 06:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
yes and these were all normally
 
06:34:25.868 --> 06:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
developed fetuses correct yes what
 
06:34:27.310 --> 06:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
organs did you harvest from these
 
06:34:30.030 --> 06:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
fetuses well I didn't personally Harvest
 
06:34:36.230 --> 06:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
any but uh a whole range of tissues were
 
06:34:38.708 --> 06:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
harvested by
 
06:34:41.270 --> 06:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
coor and these pieces were then cut up
 
06:34:43.830 --> 06:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
into little pieces right yes and they
 
06:34:43.840 --> 06:34:45.190 align:start position:0%
into little pieces right yes and they
were

06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:34:50.190 --> 06:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
cultured yes okay um some of the pieces
 
06:34:54.270 --> 06:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
of the fetuses were pituitary
 
06:34:56.270 --> 06:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
gland that were that were chopped up
 
06:34:59.030 --> 06:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
into pieces okay included the lung of
 
06:35:02.910 --> 06:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
the fetuses yes okay included skin yes
 
06:35:10.670 --> 06:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
kidney yes yes spleen yes heart yes and
 
06:35:13.590 --> 06:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
tongue I don't recall but it probably
 
06:35:16.830 --> 06:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
06:35:20.030 --> 06:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I understand
 
06:35:22.310 --> 06:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
in in your entire
 
06:35:25.190 --> 06:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
career and this is just one stud so I'm
 
06:35:27.708 --> 06:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
gonna ask let me ask you again in your
 
06:35:29.788 --> 06:35:29.798 align:start position:0%
entire career how many fetuses have you
 
06:35:29.798 --> 06:35:30.788 align:start position:0%
entire career how many fetuses have you
worked

06:35:30.788 --> 06:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
worked
 
06:35:33.388 --> 06:35:33.398 align:start position:0%
with well I don't remember the exact
 
06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
number but quite a few when we were
 
06:35:39.388 --> 06:35:39.398 align:start position:0%
studying them originally before we
 
06:35:43.788 --> 06:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:46.190 --> 06:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines that any sense I mean this one
 
06:35:48.670 --> 06:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
study had 76 how many other studies do
 
06:35:51.270 --> 06:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
you have that you used a beast I I don't
 
06:35:53.948 --> 06:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
remember how you're you're aware are you
 
06:35:57.150 --> 06:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
aware that the one of the uh objections
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
to vacination by the Pless
 
06:36:04.388 --> 06:36:04.398 align:start position:0%
cases the inclusion of aborted fetal
 
06:36:07.190 --> 06:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
tissue in the development of vaccines
 
06:36:08.830 --> 06:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it's actually part of
 
06:36:10.990 --> 06:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
the ingredients of vaccines yeah I'm
 
06:36:13.910 --> 06:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
aware of those objections the Catholic
 
06:36:17.468 --> 06:36:17.478 align:start position:0%
church has actually issued a document on
 
06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
that which that individuals who need the
 
06:36:23.030 --> 06:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
vaccin should receive the vaccines
 
06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact and that that I
 
06:37:03.230 --> 06:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:06.350 --> 06:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
m um the MMR vaccine and the and the
 
06:37:08.830 --> 06:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
Chicken Box vaccine each have in each
 
06:37:12.030 --> 06:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
vial in each vial administered have
 
06:37:13.750 --> 06:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
millions of pieces
 
06:37:18.430 --> 06:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
millions of cellular debris and DNA from
 
06:37:20.310 --> 06:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
the aborted from the culture cell on
 
06:37:23.628 --> 06:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
abor fetus in every single dose some
 
06:37:25.628 --> 06:37:25.638 align:start position:0%
people don't some people moral objection
 
06:37:28.030 --> 06:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
to that they don't want to inject a
 
06:37:30.708 --> 06:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine into their child where the
 
06:37:33.910 --> 06:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
injection will result in the ult cell
 
06:37:35.628 --> 06:37:35.638 align:start position:0%
line re board fetus millions of pieces
 
06:37:39.110 --> 06:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
of cells and DNA from that baby being
 
06:37:40.350 --> 06:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
injected into their child and they
 
06:37:41.910 --> 06:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
should be able to say no again without
 
06:37:41.920 --> 06:37:43.070 align:start position:0%
should be able to say no again without
coercion

06:37:43.070 --> 06:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
yes representative Penza thank you madam
 
06:37:50.868 --> 06:37:50.878 align:start position:0%
chair um that is listed in is it always
 
06:37:52.468 --> 06:37:52.478 align:start position:0%
listed in the ingredients sometimes you
 
06:37:55.350 --> 06:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't see it but um it's usually listed
 
06:37:58.510 --> 06:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
as MRC correct uh
 
06:38:02.468 --> 06:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
mrc-5 um and then also wi38 would be uh
 
06:38:03.868 --> 06:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
what it would be listed as but sometimes
 
06:38:06.708 --> 06:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
actually in the for example in the um in
 
06:38:08.708 --> 06:38:08.718 align:start position:0%
the cdc's excipient list it's explicitly
 
06:38:11.150 --> 06:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
stated as mrc5 I believe it says DNA and
 
06:38:13.230 --> 06:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
cell debris I think it's actually
 
06:38:14.868 --> 06:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
something I could pull it up if you want
 
06:38:17.110 --> 06:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that'd be great yeah okay sure
 
06:38:21.310 --> 06:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
follow up um I just had a question about
 
06:38:23.868 --> 06:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
in regards with I know in development
 
06:38:25.948 --> 06:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
and stuff that they can be used but what
 
06:38:29.310 --> 06:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
about specifically to do you know um uh
 
06:38:32.750 --> 06:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
for Co for the co injections yes so for
 
06:38:37.110 --> 06:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
the co vac vaccines the uh J&amp;J vaccine
 
06:38:40.110 --> 06:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
had um I believe it was the J&amp;J vaccine
 
06:38:43.830 --> 06:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
had the um in the vial itself it had
 
06:38:47.150 --> 06:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
aborted fetal celline cultured material
 
06:38:51.830 --> 06:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the madna and the um uh and fiser
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines there's nothing in the
 
06:38:55.150 --> 06:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
vial from the aborted fetal cell line
 
06:38:56.990 --> 06:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not part of the manufacturing
 
06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
process but when they were developing
 
06:39:02.388 --> 06:39:02.398 align:start position:0%
the VAC those two vaccines they did use
 
06:39:04.590 --> 06:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
a bordered fetal cells in the testing
 
06:39:06.510 --> 06:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
and development of the product so they
 
06:39:08.868 --> 06:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
would use so they wanted to they wanted
 
06:39:10.910 --> 06:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
to see how the vaccine would work in
 
06:39:12.670 --> 06:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
within human cells they use the Border
 
06:39:14.670 --> 06:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
fetal cell line cells including in
 
06:39:17.388 --> 06:39:17.398 align:start position:0%
humanized mice so they're you know um so
 
06:39:19.230 --> 06:39:19.240 align:start position:0%
they take a they'll take a border fetal
 
06:39:21.628 --> 06:39:21.638 align:start position:0%
cell lines and they will essentially
 
06:39:24.190 --> 06:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
inject them into mice and so they quote
 
06:39:25.590 --> 06:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
unquote humanize them and then they
 
06:39:26.990 --> 06:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
infect the mice and they see how it
 
06:39:29.310 --> 06:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
works so like for example I'm you know
 
06:39:31.310 --> 06:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
and this is a huge industry I mean I'm
 
06:39:33.548 --> 06:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of you know just just 100 $
 
06:39:36.910 --> 06:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
million contract from HHS NIH to create
 
06:39:39.868 --> 06:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
humanized mice for example um so there's
 
06:39:41.190 --> 06:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
um you know there an whole industry
 
06:39:42.708 --> 06:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
around and and it's and it's a big part
 
06:39:44.910 --> 06:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the testing that that occurs there's
 
06:39:49.190 --> 06:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
also a lot of um Tes and create new Bard
 
06:39:51.310 --> 06:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
fial cell lines you need to grow a virus
 
06:39:55.150 --> 06:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
in something okay so viruses replicate
 
06:39:56.868 --> 06:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
in cells you can't grow a virus in a
 
06:39:58.788 --> 06:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
Petri like you can't just grow a virus
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just it needs to grow in a
 
06:40:03.590 --> 06:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
Cell it takes over the celling machinery
 
06:40:06.070 --> 06:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to grow a virus um
 
06:40:07.590 --> 06:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know the rubella vaccine for example
 
06:40:09.310 --> 06:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
that Dr styly pla can created which is
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
why he used so many aborted babies he
 
06:40:14.468 --> 06:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
was trying to find a cellular medium to
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
grow the rebella virus so they tried
 
06:40:18.030 --> 06:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
like the heart they tried the eye they
 
06:40:19.708 --> 06:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
Tred the tongue they you know they take
 
06:40:21.030 --> 06:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
and they use lots and lots and lots of
 
06:40:22.830 --> 06:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
babies try to figure out which what to
 
06:40:26.670 --> 06:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
use um and so um a lot of times they'll
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
use cells human cells to grow them in so
 
06:40:33.830 --> 06:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
either cells um that have essence or
 
06:40:37.030 --> 06:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't so um they'll take either cell
 
06:40:39.310 --> 06:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
lines that meaning they'll replicate for
 
06:40:42.030 --> 06:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
a certain number they have a a seed
 
06:40:43.788 --> 06:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
stock and eventually they'll run out and
 
06:40:46.030 --> 06:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
then they got to get make more or in
 
06:40:48.670 --> 06:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
some instances they actually modify the
 
06:40:51.868 --> 06:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
cells and and and render them Immortal
 
06:40:53.270 --> 06:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
so they make basically like they're like
 
06:40:55.830 --> 06:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
cancerous so like there's a kidney a
 
06:40:59.230 --> 06:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
canine there's a dog kidney a dog uh
 
06:41:00.628 --> 06:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
cell line that they use that they've
 
06:41:04.030 --> 06:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
rendered Immortal that BAS basically
 
06:41:06.110 --> 06:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
will replicate for forever and they use
 
06:41:09.030 --> 06:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
that to create a certain flu shots for
 
06:41:11.468 --> 06:41:11.478 align:start position:0%
example representative
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and to just
 
06:41:17.270 --> 06:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
delve a little bit more into this I want
 
06:41:20.110 --> 06:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
to be I want to be very specific and
 
06:41:22.670 --> 06:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
clear to cure any confusion that I might
 
06:41:27.468 --> 06:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
have on this issue because when I was
 
06:41:32.270 --> 06:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
deciding back in late 2020 and early 21
 
06:41:33.788 --> 06:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
whether I would move forward for with
 
06:41:36.590 --> 06:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
receiving any vaccination I did have to
 
06:41:39.628 --> 06:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
tackle this idea I am a
 
06:41:43.430 --> 06:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
Baptist and I'm looking here at a fact
 
06:41:45.310 --> 06:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
check from The Washington Post uh
 
06:41:48.030 --> 06:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
subheadline democracy dies in
 
06:41:50.590 --> 06:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
darkness that says the vaccines were
 
06:41:54.230 --> 06:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
developed using aborted fetal cells is
 
06:41:56.830 --> 06:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
false this information I also heard from
 
06:41:59.310 --> 06:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
the government to assuage people of any
 
06:42:01.430 --> 06:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
concerns before they took this uh
 
06:42:03.190 --> 06:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
particularly with the MRNA vaccine so
 
06:42:04.190 --> 06:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
just to be
 
06:42:07.708 --> 06:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
clear were there
 
06:42:11.270 --> 06:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
any uh aborted tissues utilized and
 
06:42:15.110 --> 06:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
developing the MRNA vaccines yes it's
 
06:42:17.350 --> 06:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
exactly in the manner I just described
 
06:42:20.868 --> 06:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
and and it's categorically I mean I've
 
06:42:25.350 --> 06:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh litigated around this issue uh we uh
 
06:42:26.910 --> 06:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
got an injunction against the Air Force
 
06:42:28.670 --> 06:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned at the beginning on
 
06:42:30.510 --> 06:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of over 10,000 service members
 
06:42:33.190 --> 06:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
who uh refused covid-19 vaccine
 
06:42:35.070 --> 06:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
religious grounds preventing the Air
 
06:42:37.310 --> 06:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
Force from expelling them and one of the
 
06:42:39.708 --> 06:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
primary objections they had was the
 
06:42:42.468 --> 06:42:42.478 align:start position:0%
involvement of the then existing
 
06:42:44.670 --> 06:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines which for J&amp;J and the
 
06:42:47.230 --> 06:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
and madna and fiser mRNA vaccines and I
 
06:42:48.388 --> 06:42:48.398 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
06:42:50.788 --> 06:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
categorically that the MRNA
 
06:42:53.708 --> 06:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines have as I said earlier in the
 
06:42:56.510 --> 06:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
development and the testing they
 
06:42:58.468 --> 06:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
involved portic fetal cell lines they're
 
06:42:59.910 --> 06:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
not in the ingredients they're not in
 
06:43:02.310 --> 06:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
the formulation so if that argument if
 
06:43:05.070 --> 06:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
that article is factchecking the the the
 
06:43:06.910 --> 06:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
point that they're not in the
 
06:43:08.590 --> 06:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
ingredients and in the formulation then
 
06:43:11.948 --> 06:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
it's correct um but they're wrong that
 
06:43:13.590 --> 06:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
it did not involve the border of fetal
 
06:43:14.910 --> 06:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
cells it
 
06:43:18.350 --> 06:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
categorically 100% did in the testing of
 
06:43:20.388 --> 06:43:20.398 align:start position:0%
those products thank you and just to
 
06:43:22.788 --> 06:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
clarify the article uh the the claim
 
06:43:24.270 --> 06:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
that they are saying is false is the
 
06:43:26.830 --> 06:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines were developed using aborted
 
06:43:30.070 --> 06:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
fetal cells which is apparently patently
 
06:43:32.468 --> 06:43:32.478 align:start position:0%
untrue uh the same claim I do recall
 
06:43:35.110 --> 06:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
being made by government officials at
 
06:43:36.788 --> 06:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
the time because again I was tackling
 
06:43:40.708 --> 06:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
the same issue um and I would just have
 
06:43:42.830 --> 06:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
to go back to the testimony that from
 
06:43:45.750 --> 06:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
the deposition we heard earlier where it
 
06:43:47.548 --> 06:43:47.558 align:start position:0%
was suggested that it was okay to tell a
 
06:43:49.708 --> 06:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
noble lie in order to get the population
 
06:43:51.840 --> 06:43:51.850 align:start position:0%
to take up this vaccine thank
 
06:43:51.850 --> 06:43:53.150 align:start position:0%
to take up this vaccine thank
[Music]

06:43:53.150 --> 06:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:43:57.830 --> 06:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
you uh uh represent pull is off yeah I
 
06:44:00.788 --> 06:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
and um I actually can provide you with
 
06:44:03.628 --> 06:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
the support um let me make a note to
 
06:44:05.548 --> 06:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
show that they
 
06:44:08.388 --> 06:44:08.398 align:start position:0%
were the involvement of aborted fetal
 
06:44:10.350 --> 06:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
cells with
 
06:44:14.670 --> 06:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
mRNA I'm happy to do that um and in fact
 
06:44:16.830 --> 06:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that the one vaccine
 
06:44:19.590 --> 06:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
that they claimed had no
 
06:44:21.628 --> 06:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
involvement let's put it this way the
 
06:44:24.190 --> 06:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice did not contest
 
06:44:25.230 --> 06:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
that there was a border of fudal sell
 
06:44:26.830 --> 06:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
line involvement with the MRNA vaccines
 
06:44:29.830 --> 06:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
when we were litigating this issue so uh
 
06:44:33.548 --> 06:44:33.558 align:start position:0%
this was the Washington what
 
06:44:37.230 --> 06:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
December 8th 2020 uh Washington Post
 
06:44:40.590 --> 06:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
Yeah Yeah so you know so they Washington
 
06:44:43.948 --> 06:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
Post the purveyors of all truth they uh
 
06:44:45.190 --> 06:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh they're just
 
06:44:49.310 --> 06:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
wrong so uh I can assure you of that um
 
06:44:51.270 --> 06:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you the one that they
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
did contest was novaa they the only
 
06:44:56.070 --> 06:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine the Department of Justice in our
 
06:44:58.270 --> 06:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuit they claimed was not involved
 
06:44:59.670 --> 06:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
with the board of fetal cells with no
 
06:45:02.070 --> 06:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
acts they did not contest that the Mr
 
06:45:04.310 --> 06:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
weren't by the way and they said because
 
06:45:05.510 --> 06:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments they made is well
 
06:45:07.310 --> 06:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
they so they should take the novax
 
06:45:10.110 --> 06:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine but Nova but the novax vaccine
 
06:45:11.830 --> 06:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually does involve a board of fetal
 
06:45:17.310 --> 06:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:20.590 --> 06:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
um I need to look at what is subject to
 
06:45:21.910 --> 06:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
a confidentiality agreement in that
 
06:45:23.310 --> 06:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and what is not and I can
 
06:45:26.670 --> 06:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
provide you um uh with what isn't but I
 
06:45:28.510 --> 06:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
am certain that in our publicly filed
 
06:45:31.468 --> 06:45:31.478 align:start position:0%
papers we I know we F argued and
 
06:45:34.030 --> 06:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
explained that it of our Bo of fetal
 
06:45:35.990 --> 06:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
cell lines in the development and uh and
 
06:45:38.948 --> 06:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
that argument went away so some of the
 
06:45:41.548 --> 06:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
soldiers were willing to actually fly
 
06:45:43.708 --> 06:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
overseas because there were certain
 
06:45:45.990 --> 06:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines that were not involved in Board
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
of fetal cell lines but they none in the
 
06:45:49.868 --> 06:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
US and so some soldiers did do that
 
06:45:51.510 --> 06:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
actually to make sure that they conform
 
06:45:56.110 --> 06:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
with their beliefs um yeah uh you asked
 
06:45:59.590 --> 06:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
me to show you the uh the excipient list
 
06:46:03.990 --> 06:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
so um here is uh
 
06:46:06.868 --> 06:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
here's the Mr mmrv it says mrc5 cells
 
06:46:10.990 --> 06:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
including DNA and protein uh they
 
06:46:13.708 --> 06:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
they've sanitized it a bit by the
 
06:46:17.868 --> 06:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
way uh and then um let's see with the
 
06:46:17.878 --> 06:46:20.310 align:start position:0%
way uh and then um let's see with the
vericella

06:46:20.310 --> 06:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
vericella
 
06:46:24.350 --> 06:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine same thing it says mrc5 human
 
06:46:27.270 --> 06:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
diploid cells including DNA and protein
 
06:46:29.350 --> 06:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
so those are the that's the culture
 
06:46:30.830 --> 06:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's the sanitized version I mean if
 
06:46:33.230 --> 06:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
you if you just go simply on online and
 
06:46:35.230 --> 06:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
you just search for
 
06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
mrc5 um you know you can find basically
 
06:46:41.910 --> 06:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you know here you can buy some of it
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
um parent from this place and they'll
 
06:46:47.628 --> 06:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
usually describe um the what it is let's
 
06:46:49.350 --> 06:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
see if I happen to get lucky and pick
 
06:46:52.150 --> 06:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
the right one right out of the box and
 
06:46:54.910 --> 06:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
so um it's fiber
 
06:46:58.948 --> 06:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
blast and
 
06:47:01.310 --> 06:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
characterization it says right here MRC
 
06:47:03.310 --> 06:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
F line was derived from a normal tissue
 
06:47:06.388 --> 06:47:06.398 align:start position:0%
of a 14-week old male embryo by JP
 
06:47:09.110 --> 06:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
Jacobs in September of 1966 so there it
 
06:47:10.910 --> 06:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
is right there on the internet for you
 
06:47:14.948 --> 06:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
everybody read all right um represent po
 
06:47:18.910 --> 06:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
off uh I have a question about uh
 
06:47:23.628 --> 06:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh scientific paper about trials for
 
06:47:25.030 --> 06:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh fiser
 
06:47:28.468 --> 06:47:28.478 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh are you aware of
 
06:47:32.910 --> 06:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh whistleblower who came out from
 
06:47:37.430 --> 06:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
Vis and uh uh was
 
06:47:41.468 --> 06:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
um um was sharing that
 
06:47:46.150 --> 06:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh there was UN blinding made too early
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
and the the process of uh double blind
 
06:47:53.270 --> 06:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
study was not
 
06:47:56.110 --> 06:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
followed uh do you have any information
 
06:47:58.590 --> 06:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
on on fisa
 
06:48:00.670 --> 06:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
whistleblower yeah I believe I know the
 
06:48:03.750 --> 06:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
case you're talking about and um
 
06:48:05.670 --> 06:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
there was a a review of that evidence
 
06:48:07.070 --> 06:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
also published actually in the British
 
06:48:10.468 --> 06:48:10.478 align:start position:0%
medical journal by in a in a in a in an
 
06:48:13.270 --> 06:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
article um I am aware of that but you
 
06:48:15.110 --> 06:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
know here's the thing I I mean I would
 
06:48:17.788 --> 06:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
argue you don't you don't even need to
 
06:48:21.150 --> 06:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
go and look at um
 
06:48:24.430 --> 06:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh claims that are contested about these
 
06:48:27.190 --> 06:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
products you just go look at the FDA own
 
06:48:28.868 --> 06:48:28.878 align:start position:0%
source material that we went through
 
06:48:31.310 --> 06:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
today that's not contested nobody can
 
06:48:33.548 --> 06:48:33.558 align:start position:0%
argue against cuz that is their own
 
06:48:35.910 --> 06:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
documentation I mean that those claims
 
06:48:37.788 --> 06:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
they dispute obviously and they're
 
06:48:39.548 --> 06:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
disputing it in that whistleblower
 
06:48:42.388 --> 06:48:42.398 align:start position:0%
action um uh but but some of the other
 
06:48:44.910 --> 06:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
stuff we've looked at is
 
06:48:47.670 --> 06:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
uncontestable but yes and obviously
 
06:48:48.868 --> 06:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're trying to get
 
06:48:50.670 --> 06:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
their product license as best and as
 
06:48:53.750 --> 06:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
easily and as quickly as they
 
06:48:56.868 --> 06:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
can follow up and another a question if
 
06:49:00.788 --> 06:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
I may you mentioned uh early data from
 
06:49:03.110 --> 06:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
England and Scotland that they were
 
06:49:05.910 --> 06:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
sharing some weekly data comparing
 
06:49:09.430 --> 06:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
different populations could you expand
 
06:49:12.030 --> 06:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
like uh what it was and what the the
 
06:49:18.230 --> 06:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:22.628 --> 06:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
it yeah absolutely so they um um the
 
06:49:24.270 --> 06:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
data was typically from some of these
 
06:49:26.750 --> 06:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
countries was standardized so meaning
 
06:49:30.670 --> 06:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
you know one in you know five in 100,000
 
06:49:32.110 --> 06:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't just raw numbers it was
 
06:49:34.590 --> 06:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
standardized on a population basis and
 
06:49:37.910 --> 06:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
they were comparing the rates often of
 
06:49:37.920 --> 06:49:39.150 align:start position:0%
they were comparing the rates often of
death

06:49:39.150 --> 06:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
death
 
06:49:41.910 --> 06:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and cases between the
 
06:49:45.388 --> 06:49:45.398 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and the unvaccinated or the
 
06:49:48.868 --> 06:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
on dose or TW dose and
 
06:49:52.310 --> 06:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and um uh over time you
 
06:49:54.350 --> 06:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
know for example in uh I know for
 
06:49:57.510 --> 06:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
example believe it was in Ontario Canada
 
06:49:58.990 --> 06:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
initially they were just comparing those
 
06:50:02.388 --> 06:50:02.398 align:start position:0%
with no vaccines to those with h uh you
 
06:50:02.398 --> 06:50:03.150 align:start position:0%
with no vaccines to those with h uh you
know

06:50:03.150 --> 06:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:50:04.270 --> 06:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh who are
 
06:50:06.910 --> 06:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated well the case numbers for the
 
06:50:09.708 --> 06:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
vaccinated started exceeding the case
 
06:50:11.548 --> 06:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
numbers for the unvaccinated on a
 
06:50:14.590 --> 06:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
population meaning on a standardized for
 
06:50:17.110 --> 06:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
per 100,000 individuals so that did not
 
06:50:19.070 --> 06:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
look good so then they changed the
 
06:50:22.310 --> 06:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
definition I I we we um I have screen
 
06:50:25.030 --> 06:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
grabs of all this actually I know this
 
06:50:27.868 --> 06:50:27.878 align:start position:0%
is not a great source to you but uh on
 
06:50:30.230 --> 06:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
my Twitter feed I have uh we I screen
 
06:50:31.468 --> 06:50:31.478 align:start position:0%
grabbed this as they were doing it and
 
06:50:33.868 --> 06:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
so they're there then they Chang the
 
06:50:37.548 --> 06:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
definition to make unvaccinated meant up
 
06:50:40.788 --> 06:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
until the second week after the second
 
06:50:44.670 --> 06:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
dose So unvaccinated eventually became
 
06:50:47.868 --> 06:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
at least one dose or maybe even two
 
06:50:51.628 --> 06:50:51.638 align:start position:0%
doses compared to those who had two
 
06:50:53.070 --> 06:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
weeks after the second
 
06:50:55.670 --> 06:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
dose and then eventually the data they
 
06:50:57.670 --> 06:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
even that didn't work after a while and
 
06:50:58.708 --> 06:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
then they just got rid of the whole
 
06:51:02.310 --> 06:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
thing England had similar data as well
 
06:51:04.110 --> 06:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
and they were reporting it weekly until
 
06:51:06.990 --> 06:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
the numbers again inverted were not
 
06:51:09.830 --> 06:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
looking did not show what they wanted it
 
06:51:12.388 --> 06:51:12.398 align:start position:0%
to show Scotland to those are the two I
 
06:51:14.868 --> 06:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
I have a distinct memory of they were
 
06:51:16.750 --> 06:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
not favorable to the policy
 
06:51:19.230 --> 06:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
pronouncements of those agencies the
 
06:51:21.708 --> 06:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
data stopped being
 
06:51:24.070 --> 06:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
published I I'll yeah you you could
 
06:51:26.150 --> 06:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
speculate but there it
 
06:51:32.230 --> 06:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
is follow up so following up on uh data
 
06:51:32.240 --> 06:51:33.150 align:start position:0%
is follow up so following up on uh data
and

06:51:33.150 --> 06:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:51:35.150 --> 06:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
good data from
 
06:51:40.310 --> 06:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
observation so on population level um
 
06:51:43.750 --> 06:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
there was Israeli data released by
 
06:51:46.590 --> 06:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
Israeli government
 
06:51:49.190 --> 06:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
that uh was
 
06:51:52.990 --> 06:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
showing on a country level that there's
 
06:51:53.000 --> 06:51:54.468 align:start position:0%
showing on a country level that there's
a

06:51:54.468 --> 06:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:51:56.750 --> 06:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
spike uh in
 
06:52:00.590 --> 06:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
mortality uh about 4 months after covid
 
06:52:06.150 --> 06:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine um in injection uh and also
 
06:52:10.070 --> 06:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
there were some data again it could be
 
06:52:12.750 --> 06:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
disputable but in New Zealand there was
 
06:52:15.190 --> 06:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
a whistleblower who released their
 
06:52:20.030 --> 06:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
Countrywide data so could you comment if
 
06:52:22.388 --> 06:52:22.398 align:start position:0%
if you know of it
 
06:52:26.468 --> 06:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
and uh how how reliable that data if we
 
06:52:29.310 --> 06:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
can on Country level
 
06:52:32.468 --> 06:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
um they identify the data but basic
 
06:52:35.590 --> 06:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
Bally follow every in person injected
 
06:52:39.270 --> 06:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
not injected and see if they were
 
06:52:42.990 --> 06:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
injected like some anaphylactic shock
 
06:52:45.468 --> 06:52:45.478 align:start position:0%
Could Happen quickly but some effects as
 
06:52:48.150 --> 06:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
you showed they could take weeks or even
 
06:52:52.510 --> 06:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
months to to kill a person so if we
 
06:52:55.310 --> 06:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
could see it uh on a state level or on a
 
06:52:58.830 --> 06:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
country level does it prove anything
 
06:52:58.840 --> 06:53:00.590 align:start position:0%
country level does it prove anything
yeah

06:53:00.590 --> 06:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:53:05.110 --> 06:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
um it I think it contributes to the data
 
06:53:07.590 --> 06:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
from the biggest whistleblower out there
 
06:53:10.468 --> 06:53:10.478 align:start position:0%
which is the who and our world in data
 
06:53:12.868 --> 06:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
because if you go to those sites just
 
06:53:15.350 --> 06:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
take a look at the covid number of
 
06:53:18.110 --> 06:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
deaths from covid in the countries that
 
06:53:20.388 --> 06:53:20.398 align:start position:0%
were highly vaccinated versus the ones
 
06:53:21.548 --> 06:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
that weren't look at the
 
06:53:24.670 --> 06:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations look at the cases I
 
06:53:28.350 --> 06:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
mean uh um there were studies that have
 
06:53:33.708 --> 06:53:33.718 align:start position:0%
been done on exactly that um you know
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
I've heard the argument that well you
 
06:53:37.190 --> 06:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
know uh developing countries don't have
 
06:53:40.830 --> 06:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
as good health tracking data that's not
 
06:53:44.788 --> 06:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
true they can tell you down to the
 
06:53:47.868 --> 06:53:47.878 align:start position:0%
0.00001% the daap vaccination rate in
 
06:53:50.430 --> 06:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
their country because unlike the United
 
06:53:52.868 --> 06:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
States they have centralized
 
06:53:55.708 --> 06:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
healthare they have a c the All healthc
 
06:53:57.468 --> 06:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
Care is provided by One Source it's a
 
06:53:59.310 --> 06:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
single Source Health Care System
 
06:54:01.468 --> 06:54:01.478 align:start position:0%
everybody in their country is all in one
 
06:54:04.830 --> 06:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
database actually our Health Care system
 
06:54:07.070 --> 06:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
is fractured the American data is
 
06:54:08.910 --> 06:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
probably the worst data in the world in
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
terms of tracking this stuff but look at
 
06:54:12.548 --> 06:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of these developing countries they
 
06:54:14.708 --> 06:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
have centralized they get money from
 
06:54:16.670 --> 06:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
from uh um International organizations
 
06:54:18.990 --> 06:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
they have pretty robust especially when
 
06:54:20.670 --> 06:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
it comes to actually vaccination
 
06:54:22.310 --> 06:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
tracking because there's a ton of money
 
06:54:25.310 --> 06:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
gets poured into doing that and so um
 
06:54:28.270 --> 06:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
you know to your to to your point New
 
06:54:31.548 --> 06:54:31.558 align:start position:0%
Zealand and these other places yes you
 
06:54:33.270 --> 06:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
do have these whistle blowers who put
 
06:54:36.510 --> 06:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
data out um and I think that data
 
06:54:38.628 --> 06:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
confirms what we already
 
06:54:42.270 --> 06:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
see Visa the death rates overall in
 
06:54:43.430 --> 06:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
these countries that are highly
 
06:54:47.388 --> 06:54:47.398 align:start position:0%
vaccinated versus countries that did not
 
06:54:50.190 --> 06:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
um uh that are not highly vaccinated and
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
you would expect to have the worst
 
06:54:54.670 --> 06:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
outcomes because they have less better
 
06:54:56.230 --> 06:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
they don't have as good nutrition they
 
06:54:58.150 --> 06:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
have uh they don't have good cute Health
 
06:55:00.590 --> 06:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
Care they they don't have you know
 
06:55:03.230 --> 06:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
ventilators they didn't have have all
 
06:55:06.150 --> 06:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
the medical acute care we have here the
 
06:55:08.548 --> 06:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
the the the standard of U um the
 
06:55:10.468 --> 06:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
nutritions that we have the sanitation
 
06:55:12.830 --> 06:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
but yet they had better outcomes I'm not
 
06:55:14.948 --> 06:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
saying that I'm not I'm not just saying
 
06:55:17.388 --> 06:55:17.398 align:start position:0%
just I'm not just saying I'm I'm just
 
06:55:18.910 --> 06:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
saying that from a statistical
 
06:55:20.468 --> 06:55:20.478 align:start position:0%
perspective that raises a lot of
 
06:55:22.830 --> 06:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
questions just like the data put forth
 
06:55:27.628 --> 06:55:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:30.350 --> 06:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
plowers representative Penza thank you
 
06:55:33.150 --> 06:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair just to kind of follow up on
 
06:55:35.350 --> 06:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
what the representative just asked you
 
06:55:37.788 --> 06:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you're familiar with in
 
06:55:41.948 --> 06:55:41.958 align:start position:0%
Israel specific because I believe I mean
 
06:55:46.948 --> 06:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
they were in an uptick of um of over 90%
 
06:55:52.110 --> 06:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
of um vaccine compliance and the um
 
06:55:54.948 --> 06:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
their prime minister bared broker to
 
06:55:57.868 --> 06:55:57.878 align:start position:0%
deal and they had an exclusive with
 
06:56:00.830 --> 06:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
fizer so and I don't know where their
 
06:56:04.430 --> 06:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
data is or not but isn't that like the
 
06:56:06.990 --> 06:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
because we had multiple we madna and
 
06:56:09.150 --> 06:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
fizer and then even J&amp;J early on and
 
06:56:11.628 --> 06:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
stuff so we had you know there was it's
 
06:56:15.628 --> 06:56:15.638 align:start position:0%
mixed but they had like a like a
 
06:56:20.990 --> 06:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
perfect um one you know one um one
 
06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so I don't know what their
 
06:56:26.750 --> 06:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
data looks like but that is um that's a
 
06:56:29.628 --> 06:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
wealth of information correct for yeah I
 
06:56:31.350 --> 06:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
mean the one they are one of the most
 
06:56:33.230 --> 06:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
highly vaccinated countries in the world
 
06:56:36.150 --> 06:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
and also have uh uh one of the highest
 
06:56:38.590 --> 06:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
case rates in the whole
 
06:56:41.150 --> 06:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
world and and like you said they were
 
06:56:42.310 --> 06:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
one of the first to vaccinate and
 
06:56:46.628 --> 06:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:49.110 --> 06:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
population represent po
 
06:56:52.468 --> 06:56:52.478 align:start position:0%
off thank you for taking another
 
06:56:55.910 --> 06:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
question so uh you mentioned that there
 
06:56:58.788 --> 06:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
are several different Technologies
 
06:57:01.468 --> 06:57:01.478 align:start position:0%
behind different vaccines and even
 
06:57:03.788 --> 06:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
different techn just for covid
 
06:57:03.798 --> 06:57:05.548 align:start position:0%
different techn just for covid
vaccines

06:57:05.548 --> 06:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
06:57:08.510 --> 06:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
so um as a state New Hampshire is
 
06:57:12.788 --> 06:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
looking to expand uh authority of our
 
06:57:15.628 --> 06:57:15.638 align:start position:0%
government and add new biological
 
06:57:18.590 --> 06:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
product for example uh to New Hampshire
 
06:57:24.070 --> 06:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association next week uh uh this
 
06:57:28.430 --> 06:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
body will probably approve adding RSV
 
06:57:31.708 --> 06:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine which is not a vaccine but more
 
06:57:31.718 --> 06:57:32.868 align:start position:0%
vaccine which is not a vaccine but more
like

06:57:32.868 --> 06:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:57:32.878 --> 06:57:34.388 align:start position:0%
like
monoclonal

06:57:34.388 --> 06:57:34.398 align:start position:0%
monoclonal
 
06:57:37.628 --> 06:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
antibodies so do you have
 
06:57:40.750 --> 06:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
any thoughts about like expanding
 
06:57:44.030 --> 06:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
definition of vaccine and uh also about
 
06:57:46.788 --> 06:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
this new technologies when we keep
 
06:57:50.948 --> 06:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
adding like so it looks like we change
 
06:57:54.708 --> 06:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
definition to add mRNA vaccine mRNA
 
06:57:57.670 --> 06:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
technology to definition to vaccine now
 
06:58:00.030 --> 06:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire will be adding RSV
 
06:58:02.788 --> 06:58:02.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh maybe
 
06:58:05.388 --> 06:58:05.398 align:start position:0%
maybe they wanted to change definition
 
06:58:07.910 --> 06:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
they won't change definition anyway what
 
06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
are your thoughts on new technologies so
 
06:58:12.910 --> 06:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
the so the RSV monoclonal antibodies
 
06:58:14.270 --> 06:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
which is you're right it's interesting
 
06:58:16.310 --> 06:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's on the CDC vaccine schedule even
 
06:58:20.350 --> 06:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
though it's a monoclonal antibod um it's
 
06:58:22.190 --> 06:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
the you know if you open the plen
 
06:58:24.670 --> 06:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine textbook the medical textbook uh
 
06:58:27.388 --> 06:58:27.398 align:start position:0%
they do consider monoc antibodies a form
 
06:58:29.830 --> 06:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
of immunization not vaccination but
 
06:58:31.310 --> 06:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
immunization because it does provide
 
06:58:33.868 --> 06:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
immunity for a certain period of time
 
06:58:36.788 --> 06:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
there is also they added an RSV vaccine
 
06:58:38.590 --> 06:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
for pregnant women to the schedule so
 
06:58:43.070 --> 06:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
they actually have both on there um I I
 
06:58:46.350 --> 06:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
I I would urge
 
06:58:51.388 --> 06:58:51.398 align:start position:0%
strongly um uh uh anybody considering uh
 
06:58:52.590 --> 06:58:52.600 align:start position:0%
pushing That
 
06:58:55.510 --> 06:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine I can't imagine mandating it in
 
06:59:00.350 --> 06:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
in in any place to just look at the uh
 
06:59:02.590 --> 06:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
the summaries of the pack of the uh
 
06:59:04.990 --> 06:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
clinical trials in that for those
 
06:59:10.110 --> 06:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
products um and look at the rates of uh
 
06:59:11.948 --> 06:59:11.958 align:start position:0%
issues and complications amongst the
 
06:59:13.830 --> 06:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant women that got it who didn't
 
06:59:15.708 --> 06:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
and amongst the babies that uh got the
 
06:59:18.868 --> 06:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
menetes and who didn't and I mean um it
 
06:59:21.590 --> 06:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
speaks for itself um I don't like to say
 
06:59:23.110 --> 06:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
what those because people you know like
 
06:59:25.230 --> 06:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
five days H if I say that it just sounds
 
06:59:27.150 --> 06:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous unless I show it I don't have
 
06:59:29.270 --> 06:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
the art we could pull it up but I'm I'm
 
06:59:31.590 --> 06:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
assuming we could do you that's you now
 
06:59:33.110 --> 06:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
all know were to do that on fda's
 
06:59:34.430 --> 06:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
website and you could pull that up and
 
06:59:36.510 --> 06:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
take a look at those on your question
 
06:59:38.830 --> 06:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
about what is a vaccine what is the
 
06:59:42.110 --> 06:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:45.310 --> 06:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine in my opinion uh you know a
 
06:59:47.150 --> 06:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine what what makes something a
 
06:59:51.350 --> 06:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine is is is really whether or not
 
06:59:56.670 --> 06:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
it falls within the uh framework of the
 
06:59:59.670 --> 06:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
um what what what are the traditional
 
07:00:02.628 --> 07:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
features of a vaccine and in my opinion
 
07:00:06.270 --> 07:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
those are one you uh you claim either
 
07:00:08.548 --> 07:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
truthfully or not it stops
 
07:00:11.628 --> 07:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
transmission true you give it immunity
 
07:00:11.638 --> 07:00:12.388 align:start position:0%
transmission true you give it immunity
to

07:00:12.388 --> 07:00:12.398 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:00:14.708 --> 07:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
liability three you say you need to get
 
07:00:16.910 --> 07:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
it to protect yourself to me that's
 
07:00:19.030 --> 07:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's what makes something a vacine
 
07:00:23.388 --> 07:00:23.398 align:start position:0%
because um it falls within the rubric of
 
07:00:26.430 --> 07:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
what's uh the what I consider to be the
 
07:00:28.510 --> 07:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
problem so to speak with these products
 
07:00:31.230 --> 07:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
which is the lack of Market Force is
 
07:00:32.788 --> 07:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
protecting them and the
 
07:00:35.750 --> 07:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
Regulatory one-sidedness and and covid
 
07:00:37.708 --> 07:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
vaccines whether they're J&amp;J whether
 
07:00:40.270 --> 07:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
they're Novac whether the mrnas fall
 
07:00:44.590 --> 07:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
into directly that rubric um if if they
 
07:00:47.948 --> 07:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
would have put the MRNA product and they
 
07:00:49.628 --> 07:00:49.638 align:start position:0%
said it's not a vaccine and they would
 
07:00:52.230 --> 07:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
have said no this is a gene therapy and
 
07:00:53.708 --> 07:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have given it immunity and
 
07:00:54.990 --> 07:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have mandated it and they
 
07:00:56.590 --> 07:00:56.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have given then yeah I think it
 
07:00:57.868 --> 07:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
would have been you wouldn't think of it
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
as a vaccine but that's not what they
 
07:01:02.548 --> 07:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
did and you know and you I can make an
 
07:01:04.150 --> 07:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
argument for why tennis vaccine
 
07:01:07.868 --> 07:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a vaccine why why why it's
 
07:01:09.350 --> 07:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's for something that's not even
 
07:01:11.430 --> 07:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
transmissible how how about protesta
 
07:01:12.868 --> 07:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine it's like the opposite of a
 
07:01:15.230 --> 07:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine it actually makes I mean you
 
07:01:18.150 --> 07:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
know it has the opposite effect right so
 
07:01:19.788 --> 07:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of these vaccines are only
 
07:01:21.388 --> 07:01:21.398 align:start position:0%
personal protection well does that mean
 
07:01:23.548 --> 07:01:23.558 align:start position:0%
they're not vaccines what makes them
 
07:01:25.310 --> 07:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
common it's the features I just said so
 
07:01:28.030 --> 07:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
to me as long as I gave them immunity
 
07:01:29.750 --> 07:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
liability and they create that
 
07:01:32.150 --> 07:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory structure that is what makes
 
07:01:34.628 --> 07:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
it a vaccine whether you like it or not
 
07:01:36.070 --> 07:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
whether you want to call it something
 
07:01:39.150 --> 07:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
else or not I mean that that is the
 
07:01:44.868 --> 07:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:44.878 --> 07:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
mind

07:01:46.910 --> 07:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
mind
 
07:01:50.030 --> 07:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
followup uh I also wanted to ask about
 
07:01:54.430 --> 07:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh insurances so we talked today about
 
07:02:00.430 --> 07:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
how CDC and FDA uh um pushes this
 
07:02:02.708 --> 07:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
message uh and uh
 
07:02:04.990 --> 07:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
certain doctors and we know that there
 
07:02:07.910 --> 07:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
are some federal funding that comes with
 
07:02:14.270 --> 07:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
it but um we had um some uh testimonies
 
07:02:18.110 --> 07:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
that uh insurance industry also involved
 
07:02:18.120 --> 07:02:19.030 align:start position:0%
that uh insurance industry also involved
in

07:02:19.030 --> 07:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:02:24.948 --> 07:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
promotion of certain shots and uh my
 
07:02:28.030 --> 07:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is ideally it's what you
 
07:02:30.270 --> 07:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
said like Market should regulate it so
 
07:02:32.910 --> 07:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
if they see a better health out come and
 
07:02:35.948 --> 07:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
less spending they should be promoting
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
it but in this situation it looks like
 
07:02:41.190 --> 07:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive so they should see that
 
07:02:43.468 --> 07:02:43.478 align:start position:0%
Health outcome in their statistics is
 
07:02:46.468 --> 07:02:46.478 align:start position:0%
getting worse but they still
 
07:02:51.910 --> 07:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
incentivize doctors to uh to keep High
 
07:02:56.270 --> 07:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
rates of keeping U keeping
 
07:03:00.708 --> 07:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh vaccination rates high so I wonder if
 
07:03:03.110 --> 07:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are some additional finding if if
 
07:03:05.788 --> 07:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
you are aware that comes to insurance
 
07:03:08.548 --> 07:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
companies to do that or if there are
 
07:03:12.310 --> 07:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
some disconnect that doesn't allow them
 
07:03:16.190 --> 07:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
to see like what product is helping
 
07:03:19.670 --> 07:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
population and what product is not yeah
 
07:03:22.070 --> 07:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
I mean if if um
 
07:03:25.230 --> 07:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
reducing injuries from vaccines would
 
07:03:27.788 --> 07:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
help in improve the profitability of
 
07:03:30.150 --> 07:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies then yeah I think
 
07:03:32.230 --> 07:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
they might have an interest
 
07:03:34.670 --> 07:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
in what you just said in in in in
 
07:03:37.230 --> 07:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
looking at that issue but it it uh it
 
07:03:39.430 --> 07:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't as far as I understand the
 
07:03:42.270 --> 07:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
insurance industry first of all the
 
07:03:45.430 --> 07:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
federal government um
 
07:03:48.270 --> 07:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh vaccine for Children's Program
 
07:03:50.430 --> 07:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
basically guarantees
 
07:03:53.030 --> 07:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
payment for anybody who can't pay for a
 
07:03:54.910 --> 07:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine so these insurance companies are
 
07:03:57.468 --> 07:03:57.478 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to get paid and they're
 
07:03:58.670 --> 07:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to get reimbursed with
 
07:04:01.030 --> 07:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
federal dollars there's also some State
 
07:04:03.948 --> 07:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
programs about 50% I think between
 
07:04:06.190 --> 07:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
federal and state programs of vaccines
 
07:04:09.270 --> 07:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
are paid for with public money something
 
07:04:11.628 --> 07:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
like that so the insurance company
 
07:04:13.350 --> 07:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's guaranteed payment right they
 
07:04:14.468 --> 07:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
know they're going to get paid they
 
07:04:18.590 --> 07:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about that period um
 
07:04:21.590 --> 07:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
separately um my understanding and and
 
07:04:22.948 --> 07:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
you really should talk to Insurance
 
07:04:24.388 --> 07:04:24.398 align:start position:0%
experts about this but you know they
 
07:04:26.388 --> 07:04:26.398 align:start position:0%
have depending on the state because
 
07:04:27.830 --> 07:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
insurance law is obviously State
 
07:04:29.510 --> 07:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
dependent it varies by States but you
 
07:04:32.310 --> 07:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
know they they they make a profit margin
 
07:04:34.670 --> 07:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
basically uh you know certain kind of
 
07:04:37.548 --> 07:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
often regulated profit margin so in some
 
07:04:40.990 --> 07:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
ways the more that you have to uh pay
 
07:04:44.590 --> 07:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
for insurance the more that Medical Care
 
07:04:46.708 --> 07:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
needs to be provided the greater the
 
07:04:48.548 --> 07:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
premiums and as long as the market will
 
07:04:51.150 --> 07:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
bear it it actually ends up resulting in
 
07:04:52.910 --> 07:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
a greater increase in the percentage
 
07:04:54.948 --> 07:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
that they can make but I'm I'm no
 
07:04:56.910 --> 07:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
insurance expert you know that's my
 
07:04:59.350 --> 07:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I I I've been told but you
 
07:05:01.070 --> 07:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
should verify that with somebody who
 
07:05:03.310 --> 07:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
actually let's looked at this directly
 
07:05:04.548 --> 07:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm giving you secondhand
 
07:05:06.350 --> 07:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
information that I that you shouldn't
 
07:05:10.788 --> 07:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:13.868 --> 07:05:13.878 align:start position:0%
point but yeah I'll add this
 
07:05:16.150 --> 07:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
too you said one other thing I forgot to
 
07:05:18.510 --> 07:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
address absolutely this that the
 
07:05:20.750 --> 07:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are sitting on the
 
07:05:25.110 --> 07:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh on data that could help elucidate the
 
07:05:26.868 --> 07:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
injuries caused by these products they
 
07:05:28.830 --> 07:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
are sitting on we talked about earlier
 
07:05:32.948 --> 07:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
the ICD9 and now 10 codes um and and so
 
07:05:32.958 --> 07:05:34.150 align:start position:0%
the ICD9 and now 10 codes um and and so
within

07:05:34.150 --> 07:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
within
 
07:05:37.468 --> 07:05:37.478 align:start position:0%
every for each person that they ensure
 
07:05:38.948 --> 07:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a captive pay
 
07:05:40.948 --> 07:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
environment meaning if the insurer is
 
07:05:42.750 --> 07:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
also providing the medical care like a
 
07:05:47.910 --> 07:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
Kaiser right then they have um
 
07:05:50.430 --> 07:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
presumably really good data for every
 
07:05:53.230 --> 07:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
person in their Network they can really
 
07:05:56.270 --> 07:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
do comparisons good comparisons between
 
07:05:57.910 --> 07:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
those who have gotten the product and
 
07:05:59.548 --> 07:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
those who haven't since seen the health
 
07:06:01.948 --> 07:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
outcomes but I'm not really sure that in
 
07:06:03.670 --> 07:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
the business of doing
 
07:06:08.548 --> 07:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
that um so we had an infectious disease
 
07:06:11.670 --> 07:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
doctor in here testifying before us and
 
07:06:13.670 --> 07:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
he made a statement and I don't know if
 
07:06:15.910 --> 07:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
the committee remembers but uh when we
 
07:06:19.548 --> 07:06:19.558 align:start position:0%
were talking about the covid vaccine Etc
 
07:06:21.548 --> 07:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
and he said within the next five years
 
07:06:24.350 --> 07:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
he see he believes the cancer rates will
 
07:06:24.360 --> 07:06:25.350 align:start position:0%
he see he believes the cancer rates will
rise

07:06:25.350 --> 07:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
rise
 
07:06:27.868 --> 07:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
exponentially um and based on some of
 
07:06:31.150 --> 07:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
the information you showed uh in your
 
07:06:35.468 --> 07:06:35.478 align:start position:0%
previous slide um I think that your data
 
07:06:37.948 --> 07:06:37.958 align:start position:0%
May support some of that well let's hope
 
07:06:42.388 --> 07:06:42.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:45.350 --> 07:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
so represent
 
07:06:48.590 --> 07:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
Penza just a uh thank you madam chair
 
07:06:49.670 --> 07:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
just a quick question about the
 
07:06:53.388 --> 07:06:53.398 align:start position:0%
insurance um piece that was brought that
 
07:06:56.910 --> 07:06:56.920 align:start position:0%
was brought up is there a um do you
 
07:07:02.310 --> 07:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a any pathway um for that
 
07:07:04.190 --> 07:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
getting that data because I I never
 
07:07:08.030 --> 07:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
really thought of that that would be um
 
07:07:09.670 --> 07:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
gosh that that would be everything that
 
07:07:11.830 --> 07:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
we would need to know because of course
 
07:07:14.150 --> 07:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
especially the largest insurers in the C
 
07:07:15.868 --> 07:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
in the country you know whether it be
 
07:07:18.350 --> 07:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
Blue Crush Blue Shield ETA whatever the
 
07:07:18.360 --> 07:07:19.708 align:start position:0%
Blue Crush Blue Shield ETA whatever the
largest

07:07:19.708 --> 07:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
largest
 
07:07:23.388 --> 07:07:23.398 align:start position:0%
are I mean um and you know this is
 
07:07:24.830 --> 07:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
something obviously you need to talk to
 
07:07:27.110 --> 07:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
ledge counsel about but I mean could you
 
07:07:29.548 --> 07:07:29.558 align:start position:0%
pass a law that says that they have to
 
07:07:33.350 --> 07:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
publicly disclose de identify
 
07:07:36.708 --> 07:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh copies of all their ICD9 10 n data of
 
07:07:40.750 --> 07:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:43.350 --> 07:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
residents I like
 
07:07:45.910 --> 07:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah just make it publicly
 
07:07:54.788 --> 07:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:58.628 --> 07:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
studies so uh so you know we were going
 
07:08:01.590 --> 07:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
through informed consent and uh um you
 
07:08:03.510 --> 07:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
know I said eight questions the seventh
 
07:08:06.310 --> 07:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
was maybe you have a religious objection
 
07:08:10.868 --> 07:08:10.878 align:start position:0%
um we did um you know the good news is
 
07:08:12.830 --> 07:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
that right now there's there were six
 
07:08:14.750 --> 07:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
states where there were only medical
 
07:08:17.110 --> 07:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions but now there's five because
 
07:08:19.548 --> 07:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
Mississippi um has a federal judge has
 
07:08:22.230 --> 07:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
ordered we in lawsuit that we uh we were
 
07:08:26.430 --> 07:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
grateful to be able to bring has uh uh
 
07:08:28.830 --> 07:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh ordered that Mississippi restore
 
07:08:31.750 --> 07:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
religious exemption in the same way that
 
07:08:33.548 --> 07:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
um you know if you can keep Walmart open
 
07:08:34.830 --> 07:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic you should let
 
07:08:36.788 --> 07:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
churches stay open if you can have a
 
07:08:38.788 --> 07:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
secular exemption to vaccines to attend
 
07:08:40.590 --> 07:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
school um then you should be able to
 
07:08:42.388 --> 07:08:42.398 align:start position:0%
have a religious one and the judge
 
07:08:43.868 --> 07:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
agreed with that that's the Tandon
 
07:08:45.468 --> 07:08:45.478 align:start position:0%
Fulton and so forth Supreme Court
 
07:08:47.948 --> 07:08:47.958 align:start position:0%
precedent Co has brought certainly some
 
07:08:49.510 --> 07:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
good precedents in that regard and we're
 
07:08:51.830 --> 07:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
thankful for that uh so you know
 
07:08:53.070 --> 07:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
Mississippi has affirmed that and we're
 
07:08:54.750 --> 07:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
bringing that same case in West Virginia
 
07:08:58.350 --> 07:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
right now um and and uh um we've got
 
07:09:01.590 --> 07:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
cases in in other states as well so our
 
07:09:04.548 --> 07:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
hope is to um you know restore the the
 
07:09:06.868 --> 07:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
the the right to informed consent um
 
07:09:09.350 --> 07:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
even if it's just on a religious basis
 
07:09:10.708 --> 07:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
at least everybody should have the
 
07:09:14.868 --> 07:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
ability to make that choice um you know
 
07:09:16.510 --> 07:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to adopt the what I
 
07:09:18.948 --> 07:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
would consider to be often the beliefs
 
07:09:20.548 --> 07:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
and they are beliefs no different than
 
07:09:21.990 --> 07:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
any religious beliefs that that you will
 
07:09:23.830 --> 07:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
often hear about these products you'll
 
07:09:25.590 --> 07:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
hear the slot I believe in
 
07:09:27.868 --> 07:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
vaccines they'll say vaccines are the
 
07:09:29.430 --> 07:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
only thing that can save us from the
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic I thought that was the kind of
 
07:09:34.590 --> 07:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
language usually reserved for uh uh you
 
07:09:37.830 --> 07:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
know for God and so forth the only
 
07:09:39.628 --> 07:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
person that can save us apparently it
 
07:09:41.670 --> 07:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
was only the vaccines and you heard that
 
07:09:43.670 --> 07:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
all the time some people found that to
 
07:09:47.030 --> 07:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
be even offense to their core beliefs
 
07:09:48.388 --> 07:09:48.398 align:start position:0%
again nobody should be coerced to
 
07:09:50.110 --> 07:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
abandon their beliefs for the beliefs of
 
07:09:52.190 --> 07:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
Health authorities and the last question
 
07:09:54.708 --> 07:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
is can your doctor exercise true
 
07:09:56.868 --> 07:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
independent medical judgment when it
 
07:09:58.708 --> 07:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
comes to these products and I think
 
07:10:00.708 --> 07:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot today about why that
 
07:10:03.030 --> 07:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
potentially May may not be the case and
 
07:10:05.230 --> 07:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
in particular when it comes to medical
 
07:10:07.110 --> 07:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions and this is a true problem
 
07:10:09.868 --> 07:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
nationally which that medical exemptions
 
07:10:12.388 --> 07:10:12.398 align:start position:0%
should be like all other medicine it's
 
07:10:14.590 --> 07:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
based on clinical judgment you let the
 
07:10:16.830 --> 07:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
doctor decide most of medicine involves
 
07:10:18.230 --> 07:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
clinical judgment you go into your
 
07:10:20.430 --> 07:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
doctor review your symptoms and he makes
 
07:10:22.270 --> 07:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
a judgment or she makes a judgment call
 
07:10:23.670 --> 07:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
what medicine prescrib you whether you
 
07:10:26.070 --> 07:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
should get a medicine not get a medicine
 
07:10:27.590 --> 07:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
medicine to be sure involves a lot of
 
07:10:29.110 --> 07:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
science but it also involves a lot of
 
07:10:31.670 --> 07:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
Art and that involves making a judgment
 
07:10:33.708 --> 07:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
call that we let doctors do every single
 
07:10:35.510 --> 07:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
day for virtually every single medical
 
07:10:37.468 --> 07:10:37.478 align:start position:0%
procedure that you get but when it comes
 
07:10:39.990 --> 07:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
to vaccines that's pretty much the only
 
07:10:42.110 --> 07:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
Arena that I'm aware of where we tell
 
07:10:44.590 --> 07:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
the doctor States literally tell the
 
07:10:46.230 --> 07:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
doctor no you don't get to exercise
 
07:10:48.110 --> 07:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
medical judgment if you want to Grant a
 
07:10:50.990 --> 07:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
medical exemption it must meet the cdc's
 
07:10:53.910 --> 07:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
contraindication for cost list a narrow
 
07:10:56.788 --> 07:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
policy based list of what is or is not a
 
07:10:58.548 --> 07:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
contraindication and precaution it
 
07:11:00.910 --> 07:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
should not be that way and I urge all
 
07:11:05.030 --> 07:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
states to address that issue so um you
 
07:11:06.788 --> 07:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
know wrapping it up what's in formed
 
07:11:10.070 --> 07:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
consent again you get informed then you
 
07:11:11.708 --> 07:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
decide what the consent and at the end
 
07:11:14.948 --> 07:11:14.958 align:start position:0%
of the day you should uh if the state
 
07:11:17.750 --> 07:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
should not uh compel above that and this
 
07:11:20.270 --> 07:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
is my last slide it's my own tweet how
 
07:11:22.430 --> 07:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
about that um it's my pin tweet because
 
07:11:24.070 --> 07:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's my favorite one and I'll read it to
 
07:11:25.990 --> 07:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
you it says mandates are the tool of
 
07:11:27.670 --> 07:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
bullies criminals and dictators if a
 
07:11:29.948 --> 07:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
patient refuses a medical product after
 
07:11:31.590 --> 07:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
being conveyed its benefits and risk
 
07:11:33.590 --> 07:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
then that is called informed consent
 
07:11:35.350 --> 07:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
they were informed and did not consent
 
07:11:36.830 --> 07:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
mandating over this subjection is
 
07:11:39.030 --> 07:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
immoral and a liberal and let me really
 
07:11:40.628 --> 07:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
drive this point home because I mean
 
07:11:42.948 --> 07:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
this and and I I I you know
 
07:11:45.548 --> 07:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
I I think of all the issues that we
 
07:11:47.430 --> 07:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
confront in society this this is
 
07:11:49.030 --> 07:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably one of the most important civil
 
07:11:50.830 --> 07:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
rights issue that we're going to face
 
07:11:52.910 --> 07:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
going into the next few decades okay
 
07:11:55.548 --> 07:11:55.558 align:start position:0%
because your body is the commodity of
 
07:11:58.070 --> 07:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical sales literally Your Body
 
07:11:59.708 --> 07:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
Is Right your body your children's
 
07:12:02.510 --> 07:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
bodies are and and throughout history
 
07:12:04.868 --> 07:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
you know to be sure freedoms we talked
 
07:12:06.350 --> 07:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
about this earlier they come with their
 
07:12:08.388 --> 07:12:08.398 align:start position:0%
own risk freedom of speech comes with
 
07:12:09.868 --> 07:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
risk freedom of assembly freedom of
 
07:12:11.990 --> 07:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
religion right they can be risky people
 
07:12:13.830 --> 07:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
can say things that are wrong you looked
 
07:12:15.350 --> 07:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
at the website earlier that gave wrong
 
07:12:17.990 --> 07:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
information yeah sure can lead people
 
07:12:20.868 --> 07:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
astray but throughout history when we
 
07:12:23.430 --> 07:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
look at what has caused the most harm in
 
07:12:26.350 --> 07:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
humanity in my in my opinion the
 
07:12:28.388 --> 07:12:28.398 align:start position:0%
greatest harm to humanity has always
 
07:12:29.948 --> 07:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
been governments that believe that they
 
07:12:31.868 --> 07:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
know better than you how to live your
 
07:12:33.910 --> 07:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
life and that it was a dictator it was a
 
07:12:35.910 --> 07:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
king it was a central Authority that was
 
07:12:39.150 --> 07:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
going to decide for you what you can or
 
07:12:41.030 --> 07:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
cannot do that has wrought more
 
07:12:43.150 --> 07:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
destruction and harm throughout history
 
07:12:45.270 --> 07:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
on on on on the on the world more than
 
07:12:47.548 --> 07:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
any pestilence or disease and and when
 
07:12:48.948 --> 07:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
you look back through the course of
 
07:12:51.110 --> 07:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
history and we and you know one of the
 
07:12:52.990 --> 07:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful things especially as the
 
07:12:54.030 --> 07:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
principles of this country have
 
07:12:55.670 --> 07:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
developed over the last 200 and
 
07:12:57.830 --> 07:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
something years is we've come to
 
07:12:59.150 --> 07:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
understand that principle here and I
 
07:13:01.430 --> 07:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
think up until recently we it was is a
 
07:13:03.270 --> 07:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
basic part of you know the ethos in this
 
07:13:04.788 --> 07:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
country which is that we protect the
 
07:13:07.070 --> 07:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
rights of even the most vile
 
07:13:09.628 --> 07:13:09.638 align:start position:0%
speech in order to protect the rights of
 
07:13:12.628 --> 07:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
everybody to have free speech right um
 
07:13:14.708 --> 07:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
we let the you know neo-nazis walk
 
07:13:17.590 --> 07:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
through sko Illinois Jewish Community
 
07:13:19.270 --> 07:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
because protecting their speech protect
 
07:13:21.190 --> 07:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
all of our speech is as reprehensible as
 
07:13:23.510 --> 07:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
we found that speech right as long as no
 
07:13:24.830 --> 07:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
violence is
 
07:13:28.948 --> 07:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
involved we protect it and and um you
 
07:13:31.150 --> 07:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
know how quickly that ethos was lost
 
07:13:33.788 --> 07:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
over the last few years how quickly we
 
07:13:36.270 --> 07:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
abandoned the basic principle for a
 
07:13:38.910 --> 07:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of safety um and and it was
 
07:13:40.750 --> 07:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
very scary for me personally to see
 
07:13:41.990 --> 07:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
happen it was very heartened when it
 
07:13:47.708 --> 07:13:47.718 align:start position:0%
went the other way as well but um um he
 
07:13:49.708 --> 07:13:49.718 align:start position:0%
dictators and and those throughout
 
07:13:52.388 --> 07:13:52.398 align:start position:0%
history the resort to mandates to
 
07:13:54.708 --> 07:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
censorship to bullies always happens
 
07:13:56.750 --> 07:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
when what when you can't conve convince
 
07:13:58.868 --> 07:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
on the merits you think dictators
 
07:14:00.628 --> 07:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
immediately just start beating you no
 
07:14:02.270 --> 07:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
they first tell you what to do it's only
 
07:14:05.110 --> 07:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
when you don't listen that they beat you
 
07:14:07.468 --> 07:14:07.478 align:start position:0%
they mandate they censor you put you in
 
07:14:09.628 --> 07:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
the goog or whatever throw you out of
 
07:14:11.590 --> 07:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
your job throw you out of school you
 
07:14:14.310 --> 07:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
know they they shun you that is what
 
07:14:17.468 --> 07:14:17.478 align:start position:0%
dictators that's what bullies do we in a
 
07:14:20.628 --> 07:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
free democracy old school mean liberal
 
07:14:22.830 --> 07:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
IDE ideas
 
07:14:26.230 --> 07:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
right versus being
 
07:14:27.990 --> 07:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
illiberal government should try to
 
07:14:30.110 --> 07:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
persuade on the merits that's what you
 
07:14:31.788 --> 07:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
should do Health
 
07:14:33.868 --> 07:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
authorities take this vaccine you should
 
07:14:35.670 --> 07:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
take it it's great it's safe effective
 
07:14:38.310 --> 07:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
here's the data but if they can't and
 
07:14:39.868 --> 07:14:39.878 align:start position:0%
you say no that should be the end of the
 
07:14:42.190 --> 07:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
story should be true for masks it should
 
07:14:44.310 --> 07:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
be true for everything because people
 
07:14:47.468 --> 07:14:47.478 align:start position:0%
are smart on a population level you know
 
07:14:49.830 --> 07:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
why you need to resort to mandates
 
07:14:50.990 --> 07:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
because when there's real questions
 
07:14:53.070 --> 07:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
about safety and efficacy that's why you
 
07:14:56.468 --> 07:14:56.478 align:start position:0%
need to resort to mandates because uh uh
 
07:14:58.110 --> 07:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
there's real issues if there were no
 
07:14:59.708 --> 07:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
issues you wouldn't need
 
07:15:03.868 --> 07:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
mandates so so um that's my um you know
 
07:15:06.590 --> 07:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's my my ideological Bend and my
 
07:15:09.948 --> 07:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
bias in terms of these products uh it is
 
07:15:14.750 --> 07:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know if we let if we let the
 
07:15:14.760 --> 07:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
that um you know if we let if we let the
pharmaceutical

07:15:17.430 --> 07:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
07:15:20.070 --> 07:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
industry continue the lobbying efforts I
 
07:15:21.750 --> 07:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
know they do on all 50 states to get rid
 
07:15:25.230 --> 07:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
of exemptions to get rid of uh uh uh um
 
07:15:28.388 --> 07:15:28.398 align:start position:0%
to vaccines let to add more vaccines to
 
07:15:31.628 --> 07:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
the schedule to first it was preschool
 
07:15:33.590 --> 07:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
then it was elementary school then it
 
07:15:35.948 --> 07:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
was high school then it was College then
 
07:15:37.510 --> 07:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
it was healthcare workers then it's
 
07:15:39.948 --> 07:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
Preschool teachers right then during the
 
07:15:42.350 --> 07:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
pandemic now was going into a
 
07:15:44.948 --> 07:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
store what if that system could have
 
07:15:47.590 --> 07:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
they if that stuck during Co and thank
 
07:15:50.628 --> 07:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
God it didn't there's no doubt that you
 
07:15:53.468 --> 07:15:53.478 align:start position:0%
would load more products onto it why not
 
07:15:54.948 --> 07:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
right think about it it's it's a
 
07:15:57.910 --> 07:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
mandated guaranteed Market liability
 
07:15:59.430 --> 07:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
free why wouldn't you add more products
 
07:16:01.190 --> 07:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
to it it would be silly from a business
 
07:16:05.070 --> 07:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
perspective not to and you know um and
 
07:16:06.990 --> 07:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
for all those out there who say well I
 
07:16:08.990 --> 07:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
love vaccines and I love masks and I
 
07:16:11.270 --> 07:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
love all those products great you should
 
07:16:14.190 --> 07:16:14.200 align:start position:0%
free to get them but if if everybody
 
07:16:17.468 --> 07:16:17.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't stand up and say the line is you
 
07:16:20.468 --> 07:16:20.478 align:start position:0%
can't mandate it the day will come when
 
07:16:22.110 --> 07:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a product that that person
 
07:16:24.468 --> 07:16:24.478 align:start position:0%
doesn't want and now they can't get a
 
07:16:26.990 --> 07:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
job or out of their home so what rights
 
07:16:29.310 --> 07:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
do they have left right so now they're
 
07:16:30.468 --> 07:16:30.478 align:start position:0%
home they can't get a job they can't go
 
07:16:32.270 --> 07:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
to school can't parti in Civil Society
 
07:16:33.590 --> 07:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
so they got a right to freedom of speech
 
07:16:35.230 --> 07:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
by themselves assembly by themselves
 
07:16:38.350 --> 07:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
religion to the wall that's why I really
 
07:16:40.788 --> 07:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
believe that this is such a critical
 
07:16:43.510 --> 07:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
civil rights issue this idea that the
 
07:16:45.190 --> 07:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
government can tell you what you must
 
07:16:47.070 --> 07:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
inject or put on your body to
 
07:16:48.628 --> 07:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
participate in Civil
 
07:16:50.670 --> 07:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
Society whatever
 
07:16:52.948 --> 07:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
dangers it might
 
07:16:55.510 --> 07:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
present not wearing a mask the greater
 
07:16:56.910 --> 07:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
danger is letting the government have
 
07:16:58.670 --> 07:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
that Authority because I don't think
 
07:17:01.030 --> 07:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
that it it will stop and if you're going
 
07:17:03.590 --> 07:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
to do it at least at least remove the
 
07:17:05.990 --> 07:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
liability protection it's incredible
 
07:17:08.350 --> 07:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
that the most uh the products that have
 
07:17:11.110 --> 07:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
the most uh uh Protections in term of
 
07:17:12.190 --> 07:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
able to see the pharmace companies are
 
07:17:14.430 --> 07:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
the ones that you would mandate um so in
 
07:17:17.230 --> 07:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
any event that's um um in terms of New
 
07:17:19.150 --> 07:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's approach to covid vaccine
 
07:17:20.990 --> 07:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
Which is far better than most States and
 
07:17:23.788 --> 07:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
to be commended for that for sure um
 
07:17:27.190 --> 07:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
that would be my uh what I would testify
 
07:17:29.948 --> 07:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
to in terms of thoughts going forward um
 
07:17:31.510 --> 07:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of reflecting back on what did
 
07:17:34.150 --> 07:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
happen during Co and in the future in
 
07:17:36.190 --> 07:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
terms of what what should be thought of
 
07:17:39.708 --> 07:17:39.718 align:start position:0%
as the primary uh issue to to to avoid
 
07:17:41.388 --> 07:17:41.398 align:start position:0%
which is
 
07:17:48.030 --> 07:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:50.590 --> 07:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
choose represent po
 
07:17:54.270 --> 07:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
off thank you so uh I I agree with your
 
07:17:57.310 --> 07:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
assessment on proper role of government
 
07:18:00.788 --> 07:18:00.798 align:start position:0%
and civil liberties but we hear from
 
07:18:05.150 --> 07:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
from the opposite side that um we need
 
07:18:05.160 --> 07:18:06.030 align:start position:0%
from the opposite side that um we need
to

07:18:06.030 --> 07:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:18:09.468 --> 07:18:09.478 align:start position:0%
consider benefit to society and if too
 
07:18:13.230 --> 07:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
many people experience symptoms uh and
 
07:18:17.190 --> 07:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
get sick uh it put too much pressure for
 
07:18:20.150 --> 07:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
example on medical
 
07:18:24.590 --> 07:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
industry and similarly uh one example is
 
07:18:29.430 --> 07:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh smoking and Indo smoking people used
 
07:18:34.350 --> 07:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
to smoke smoke ins in inside New
 
07:18:37.270 --> 07:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state house but now government
 
07:18:39.990 --> 07:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
stops it so you don't get secondhand
 
07:18:44.670 --> 07:18:44.680 align:start position:0%
smoking here so the same argument that
 
07:18:47.350 --> 07:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes um
 
07:18:50.310 --> 07:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
some government intervention and some
 
07:18:54.230 --> 07:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
mandate is needed to prevent pressure
 
07:18:57.548 --> 07:18:57.558 align:start position:0%
for example on medical industry oh I
 
07:18:59.230 --> 07:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate those two comments actually I
 
07:19:00.430 --> 07:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
think they're great points and let me
 
07:19:02.750 --> 07:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
address both of them in terms of the
 
07:19:04.990 --> 07:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
first one the idea that well we have to
 
07:19:07.190 --> 07:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden on the medical care
 
07:19:09.230 --> 07:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
system first of
 
07:19:12.270 --> 07:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
all if you accept that argument I want
 
07:19:15.590 --> 07:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
to remind you that the number one killer
 
07:19:18.150 --> 07:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
during the entire pandemic was not covid
 
07:19:20.948 --> 07:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
in America number one killer was C
 
07:19:23.350 --> 07:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
disease was heart disease that was the
 
07:19:26.270 --> 07:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
greatest burden on our medical system so
 
07:19:29.628 --> 07:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
is the argument that to in order to
 
07:19:31.590 --> 07:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden on the medical system
 
07:19:33.708 --> 07:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
we're now allowed to mandate
 
07:19:36.948 --> 07:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
stattin should we be allowed to mandate
 
07:19:38.868 --> 07:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
exercise should we be allowed to mandate
 
07:19:41.548 --> 07:19:41.558 align:start position:0%
folks from eating too much saturated fat
 
07:19:42.868 --> 07:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
I mean if you're going to argue that we
 
07:19:44.830 --> 07:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
could take away civil liberties in order
 
07:19:47.310 --> 07:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
to reduce the burden on the medical
 
07:19:47.320 --> 07:19:48.990 align:start position:0%
to reduce the burden on the medical
system

07:19:48.990 --> 07:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
07:19:53.910 --> 07:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
then I don't then then there's nothing
 
07:19:56.310 --> 07:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
that the government really can't mandate
 
07:19:59.430 --> 07:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
again I'll say it again absolutely you
 
07:20:01.070 --> 07:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
there might be some harm and giving
 
07:20:03.548 --> 07:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
people freedoms right may maybe it's
 
07:20:05.990 --> 07:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
true maybe it would have been a bit more
 
07:20:08.468 --> 07:20:08.478 align:start position:0%
of a burden um on the medical system if
 
07:20:11.350 --> 07:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
we let people choose the covid vaccine
 
07:20:13.270 --> 07:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
remember it doesn't mean you can't get
 
07:20:15.350 --> 07:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
it it just means for those that don't
 
07:20:17.830 --> 07:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
want it you can't coerce them that's
 
07:20:20.990 --> 07:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
what it means persuade them if it's so
 
07:20:24.310 --> 07:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
great if the product is so good then why
 
07:20:25.670 --> 07:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
can't you persuade people to take it do
 
07:20:28.110 --> 07:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
I need to persuade you to eat to drink
 
07:20:31.270 --> 07:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
water to go to sleep no why because
 
07:20:32.468 --> 07:20:32.478 align:start position:0%
there's really no question about safety
 
07:20:34.350 --> 07:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
and efficacy why don't you need to
 
07:20:37.350 --> 07:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
mandate me to you know to engage in
 
07:20:40.110 --> 07:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
basic functions and if the medical
 
07:20:42.190 --> 07:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
intervention is going to be one that
 
07:20:43.830 --> 07:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
really will have a cost benefit that's
 
07:20:46.110 --> 07:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
far better then wonderful persuade on
 
07:20:48.070 --> 07:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
the merits this idea that you have to
 
07:20:49.910 --> 07:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
crush civil liberties in order to
 
07:20:51.510 --> 07:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
protect the medical system is a very
 
07:20:53.468 --> 07:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
dangerous slippery slope and I don't
 
07:20:55.030 --> 07:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
think it holds up to scrutiny because
 
07:20:56.590 --> 07:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
what it does is it means that they can
 
07:20:59.868 --> 07:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
mandate anything second I do not view
 
07:21:01.590 --> 07:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting smoking the same as
 
07:21:04.070 --> 07:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
mandating a product that is that is
 
07:21:05.910 --> 07:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
saying you can't do something that's
 
07:21:08.868 --> 07:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
totally different you can't equate
 
07:21:10.948 --> 07:21:10.958 align:start position:0%
saying you can't smoke in the state
 
07:21:13.510 --> 07:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
house building with you must get an
 
07:21:17.430 --> 07:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
injection of this product into your body
 
07:21:19.628 --> 07:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
to come into the state house building or
 
07:21:22.788 --> 07:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
you must wear you must wear a mask on
 
07:21:24.350 --> 07:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
your face to come into the state house
 
07:21:27.910 --> 07:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
building they're not the same at all in
 
07:21:30.190 --> 07:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
my opion at all one does not require me
 
07:21:34.230 --> 07:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
to do anything sure it prohibits me from
 
07:21:35.830 --> 07:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
doing something in a certain environment
 
07:21:38.788 --> 07:21:38.798 align:start position:0%
but you can't you can't equate the
 
07:21:40.388 --> 07:21:40.398 align:start position:0%
infringement on civil individual rights
 
07:21:45.190 --> 07:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:48.628 --> 07:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
actions represent Penza I know it's
 
07:21:51.190 --> 07:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
getting so late thank you madam chair um
 
07:21:55.030 --> 07:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
I just I I had a couple questions just I
 
07:21:57.468 --> 07:21:57.478 align:start position:0%
I know you must be familiar and I'm on
 
07:22:01.468 --> 07:22:01.478 align:start position:0%
the CDC website right now um in regards
 
07:22:03.548 --> 07:22:03.558 align:start position:0%
with the
 
07:22:07.110 --> 07:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
covid-19 um vaccines
 
07:22:12.830 --> 07:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
so um so you have the 2023 2024 formula
 
07:22:16.430 --> 07:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
for ages 6 months to 11 years but that
 
07:22:18.948 --> 07:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
formula even though they it's weird
 
07:22:20.430 --> 07:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
because all the documents that go with
 
07:22:21.990 --> 07:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
it and I've been reading them since I've
 
07:22:26.350 --> 07:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
been here um are all say that they still
 
07:22:29.590 --> 07:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
have eua on it even though then they say
 
07:22:33.110 --> 07:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
authorized so not they're still using of
 
07:22:37.990 --> 07:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
course the eua formula so it's not
 
07:22:41.468 --> 07:22:41.478 align:start position:0%
approved correct for that group 6 months
 
07:22:44.548 --> 07:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
to 11 years yeah it depends uh yes so
 
07:22:48.070 --> 07:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
depending on the age and the product um
 
07:22:50.430 --> 07:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
and and whether you're talking about the
 
07:22:52.670 --> 07:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
initial version the B veent version the
 
07:22:56.990 --> 07:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
new updated version some are e eua
 
07:22:59.868 --> 07:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
authorized and then some are licensed
 
07:23:02.948 --> 07:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
and some are and some are now um being
 
07:23:06.628 --> 07:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh basically treated like a flu shot I'm
 
07:23:07.670 --> 07:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
sure you're aware of that where they're
 
07:23:11.510 --> 07:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to update it now annually um and
 
07:23:14.350 --> 07:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
um and release it I mean I I essentially
 
07:23:15.628 --> 07:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
if you look at the guidance we're going
 
07:23:17.510 --> 07:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
to have a new covid vaccine every year
 
07:23:18.590 --> 07:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
at this point and it's going to be
 
07:23:20.150 --> 07:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
treated like a flu shot and they're now
 
07:23:23.270 --> 07:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
developing a single dose flu plus covid
 
07:23:24.548 --> 07:23:24.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine that they're intending to give
 
07:23:28.030 --> 07:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
to everybody follow up um thank you
 
07:23:31.150 --> 07:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes I'm familiar with that
 
07:23:35.230 --> 07:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
um dual shot and so I just when we were
 
07:23:38.468 --> 07:23:38.478 align:start position:0%
going through some stuff here in um in
 
07:23:41.430 --> 07:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in regards with you know
 
07:23:44.350 --> 07:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
mandates that were um coming down really
 
07:23:46.750 --> 07:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
from you know what we consider Private
 
07:23:49.388 --> 07:23:49.398 align:start position:0%
Business even though you know hospitals
 
07:23:50.510 --> 07:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're open to the public
 
07:23:51.708 --> 07:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
they're taking in tons of government
 
07:23:53.150 --> 07:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
money you know I know that argument
 
07:23:54.868 --> 07:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
there's not really any such thing as a
 
07:23:58.270 --> 07:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
private business anymore but um one of
 
07:24:00.868 --> 07:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
the the largest hospital in the state
 
07:24:03.708 --> 07:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh sent out a memo to all of their
 
07:24:06.990 --> 07:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
employees because their um a lot of the
 
07:24:09.510 --> 07:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
arguments were were you know this is not
 
07:24:13.070 --> 07:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
a um it's eua so it is of course you
 
07:24:15.388 --> 07:24:15.398 align:start position:0%
know it's um hasn't been approved yet
 
07:24:18.548 --> 07:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
and the and the um the CEO of the
 
07:24:20.750 --> 07:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
hospital sent this out to the employees
 
07:24:23.468 --> 07:24:23.478 align:start position:0%
and it stated um hey you don't have to
 
07:24:26.308 --> 07:24:26.318 align:start position:0%
worry about it anymore this was when and
 
07:24:29.230 --> 07:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
I can't pronounce it comti or yeah I
 
07:24:30.948 --> 07:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
call it katti everybody pronounce it
 
07:24:35.308 --> 07:24:35.318 align:start position:0%
different okay Kady um had been
 
07:24:37.670 --> 07:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
approved but lo and
 
07:24:40.388 --> 07:24:40.398 align:start position:0%
behold that got approved but there
 
07:24:42.708 --> 07:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
weren't any of them and there weren't
 
07:24:45.070 --> 07:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
any of them that were going to be out
 
07:24:48.030 --> 07:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
and be ready to be injected in anybody's
 
07:24:50.270 --> 07:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
arms for
 
07:24:52.750 --> 07:24:52.760 align:start position:0%
months and that wasn't talked about at
 
07:24:55.230 --> 07:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
all so it was kind of like oh you don't
 
07:24:56.750 --> 07:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to worry about it anymore everybody
 
07:24:59.430 --> 07:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's concerned you know uh it it has
 
07:25:01.868 --> 07:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
been authorized go get it but when they
 
07:25:03.230 --> 07:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
were going to go get it to be able to
 
07:25:05.990 --> 07:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
keep their jobs they were actually still
 
07:25:08.548 --> 07:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
getting the same exact thing so you know
 
07:25:12.990 --> 07:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
I just that that I mean misinformation
 
07:25:15.230 --> 07:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
lies in a sense to encourage people to
 
07:25:17.548 --> 07:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
have that uptick was really for the
 
07:25:19.628 --> 07:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
medical for all these healthcare workers
 
07:25:22.948 --> 07:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
was huge did you see that type of things
 
07:25:25.190 --> 07:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
happening because you're in Arizona that
 
07:25:27.308 --> 07:25:27.318 align:start position:0%
happened a lot in New Hampshire
 
07:25:30.628 --> 07:25:30.638 align:start position:0%
especially in our in um in our Medical
 
07:25:32.548 --> 07:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
field yeah it happened across the entire
 
07:25:35.350 --> 07:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
country because the CMS mandate the
 
07:25:37.708 --> 07:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
federal CMS mandate on on healthcare
 
07:25:39.308 --> 07:25:39.318 align:start position:0%
workers was upheld by the US Supreme
 
07:25:40.868 --> 07:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
Court if you remember there were two
 
07:25:42.990 --> 07:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
cases that went up the oath one which we
 
07:25:46.910 --> 07:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
we also um uh we we filed it on behalf
 
07:25:48.468 --> 07:25:48.478 align:start position:0%
of a car dealership that had more than
 
07:25:49.670 --> 07:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
100 employees or all the other car
 
07:25:51.230 --> 07:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
dealers less than 100 employees we were
 
07:25:52.308 --> 07:25:52.318 align:start position:0%
one of the cases up in the Supreme Court
 
07:25:54.030 --> 07:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
on the oath but I didn't and then there
 
07:25:55.388 --> 07:25:55.398 align:start position:0%
was the CMS case which we weren't
 
07:25:58.070 --> 07:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
involved with and then the CMS case the
 
07:25:59.788 --> 07:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court upheld that mandate on
 
07:26:02.510 --> 07:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
Healthcare workers um you know when you
 
07:26:04.308 --> 07:26:04.318 align:start position:0%
think about what I was saying earlier
 
07:26:06.230 --> 07:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
about religious beliefs with regards to
 
07:26:09.070 --> 07:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
these products here is the medical
 
07:26:11.868 --> 07:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
profession for a product they
 
07:26:14.750 --> 07:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
knew did not stop transmission
 
07:26:17.270 --> 07:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
nonetheless and was saying we can't
 
07:26:18.788 --> 07:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
overburden the Health Care system was
 
07:26:21.150 --> 07:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
willing to throw out doctors nurses and
 
07:26:23.150 --> 07:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Professionals over a
 
07:26:25.350 --> 07:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
product that was at best personal
 
07:26:28.990 --> 07:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
protection I mean uh you know it
 
07:26:30.990 --> 07:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
requires a leap of faith to do do that
 
07:26:32.948 --> 07:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
because they don't that makes no logical
 
07:26:35.590 --> 07:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
sense it's not logical you know it only
 
07:26:37.830 --> 07:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense if you're making emotional
 
07:26:40.308 --> 07:26:40.318 align:start position:0%
belief based decisions that don't
 
07:26:44.110 --> 07:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
comport with you know just reason logic
 
07:26:47.350 --> 07:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
or evidence so yes I did we did see that
 
07:26:51.590 --> 07:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
all over the country now the um the CMS
 
07:26:55.868 --> 07:26:55.878 align:start position:0%
mandate did not anull the potential to
 
07:26:59.190 --> 07:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
get a title 7 religious exemption under
 
07:27:02.150 --> 07:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
federal law so title 7 requires
 
07:27:03.750 --> 07:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
employers nationally to give
 
07:27:05.948 --> 07:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
accommodations for religious beliefs in
 
07:27:07.590 --> 07:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
different states and different employers
 
07:27:10.308 --> 07:27:10.318 align:start position:0%
were more or less accommodating during
 
07:27:13.230 --> 07:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic our you know our firm
 
07:27:15.628 --> 07:27:15.638 align:start position:0%
helped thousand hundreds thousands I
 
07:27:17.308 --> 07:27:17.318 align:start position:0%
don't know the exact with thousands
 
07:27:18.230 --> 07:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
overall I don't know how many of our
 
07:27:21.510 --> 07:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
healthare workers get exemptions to the
 
07:27:23.788 --> 07:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine mandates on title seven
 
07:27:25.830 --> 07:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
grounds on religious objection grounds
 
07:27:28.350 --> 07:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
often because of uh interaction with the
 
07:27:31.308 --> 07:27:31.318 align:start position:0%
boorder of fetal cells uh despite the
 
07:27:33.670 --> 07:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
Washington post's claim from December of
 
07:27:38.070 --> 07:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh of a number of years ago so um so
 
07:27:40.590 --> 07:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that we did see that and and and I
 
07:27:43.628 --> 07:27:43.638 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you that a potential
 
07:27:47.388 --> 07:27:47.398 align:start position:0%
solution could be that if you wanted to
 
07:27:49.468 --> 07:27:49.478 align:start position:0%
um you know if if there were a New
 
07:27:53.308 --> 07:27:53.318 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that said that upon the
 
07:27:55.708 --> 07:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
receipt of a religious an exemption for
 
07:27:58.510 --> 07:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
religious accommodation it cannot be
 
07:28:01.708 --> 07:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
questioned that you that just must be
 
07:28:04.750 --> 07:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
accepted um then that would create the
 
07:28:06.708 --> 07:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
exceptions in that scenario for those
 
07:28:09.270 --> 07:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
medical healthcare workers um actually
 
07:28:12.670 --> 07:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
in Arizona a bill went all the way um
 
07:28:14.868 --> 07:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
went through on that and I believe it
 
07:28:16.708 --> 07:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
ended up getting unfortunately vetoed by
 
07:28:19.708 --> 07:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
the governor but it did pass to to to
 
07:28:22.708 --> 07:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
create what I just said to protect those
 
07:28:25.150 --> 07:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers who uh wanted to make
 
07:28:25.160 --> 07:28:28.708 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers who uh wanted to make
evidence-based

07:28:28.708 --> 07:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:31.708 --> 07:28:31.718 align:start position:0%
decisions repres
 
07:28:35.350 --> 07:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
leus are you familiar with any cases and
 
07:28:38.750 --> 07:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
do any people have standing who actually
 
07:28:41.628 --> 07:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
tried to get medical exemptions and were
 
07:28:44.350 --> 07:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
denied when they could show that they
 
07:28:48.590 --> 07:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
were actually verifiable I I mean um
 
07:28:51.910 --> 07:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions such as for the
 
07:28:55.788 --> 07:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
aborted fetal cells Etc oh yeah oh we
 
07:28:58.030 --> 07:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
have lots of cases so obviously our case
 
07:29:00.590 --> 07:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
against the Air Force and the army uh we
 
07:29:02.628 --> 07:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
didn't do the Navy or or the uh the
 
07:29:03.990 --> 07:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
Marines we did the air force of the army
 
07:29:06.190 --> 07:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
we got injunctions in both those cases
 
07:29:08.190 --> 07:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
for individuals in both branches the
 
07:29:10.948 --> 07:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
military who for on religious grounds do
 
07:29:13.590 --> 07:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
not want a vaccine we represent uh we
 
07:29:14.948 --> 07:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
also have an employment practice at the
 
07:29:17.070 --> 07:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
firm um and our employment practice is
 
07:29:19.468 --> 07:29:19.478 align:start position:0%
heavily focused on representing
 
07:29:21.070 --> 07:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been fired for
 
07:29:22.990 --> 07:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
refusing a covid-19 vaccine on religious
 
07:29:24.510 --> 07:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
grounds actually that's almost all our
 
07:29:26.308 --> 07:29:26.318 align:start position:0%
cases we have numerous class actions
 
07:29:27.510 --> 07:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
against employers around the country
 
07:29:30.628 --> 07:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
they're all title seven cases so um um
 
07:29:35.190 --> 07:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
we have lots of those um and uh uh and
 
07:29:36.350 --> 07:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
obviously we brought the case in
 
07:29:38.468 --> 07:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
Mississippi to restore Rel exemption so
 
07:29:40.830 --> 07:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of work in that area I mean
 
07:29:42.270 --> 07:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
listen the First Freedom under the
 
07:29:43.670 --> 07:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the in the Bill of
 
07:29:45.150 --> 07:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
Rights in the First Amendment and the
 
07:29:47.350 --> 07:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
First Freedom in the first amendment is
 
07:29:49.270 --> 07:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
the freedom of religion right I mean
 
07:29:50.590 --> 07:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
that is what this country is founded on
 
07:29:52.110 --> 07:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
was the idea that you can come here you
 
07:29:53.308 --> 07:29:53.318 align:start position:0%
can live out your convictions and you
 
07:29:55.590 --> 07:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
know back back when that uh amendment
 
07:29:57.750 --> 07:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
was written you know religion was
 
07:29:59.070 --> 07:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
something far broader I think the most
 
07:30:00.990 --> 07:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
Americans think of it today people think
 
07:30:03.350 --> 07:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
of religion today as like Sunday um but
 
07:30:06.868 --> 07:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
really back then it was your it was um
 
07:30:08.468 --> 07:30:08.478 align:start position:0%
it was how you lived your life right it
 
07:30:11.350 --> 07:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
was you be able to come to this country
 
07:30:14.030 --> 07:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
and be able to live your convictions
 
07:30:16.070 --> 07:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
right and and and that's not just going
 
07:30:18.388 --> 07:30:18.398 align:start position:0%
to church on Sunday that's being able to
 
07:30:21.750 --> 07:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
live my convictions and as a free person
 
07:30:23.948 --> 07:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
not have the government crush them and
 
07:30:26.030 --> 07:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
so you know when if I'm you know
 
07:30:27.430 --> 07:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
somebody should be able to say look you
 
07:30:30.030 --> 07:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
guys are treating this product like it's
 
07:30:32.190 --> 07:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
you know like it's a a deity I mean you
 
07:30:34.070 --> 07:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
know if I'm going to
 
07:30:36.590 --> 07:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
attribute properties to something that
 
07:30:39.388 --> 07:30:39.398 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have you know I can say well
 
07:30:40.510 --> 07:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
look at this this product stops
 
07:30:43.788 --> 07:30:43.798 align:start position:0%
transmission when uh it doesn't I mean
 
07:30:45.788 --> 07:30:45.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that's idol worship but
 
07:30:48.788 --> 07:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that I'm saying that you know
 
07:30:50.230 --> 07:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's akin
 
07:30:52.350 --> 07:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
to taking something that's just an
 
07:30:54.830 --> 07:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
inanimate object and giving it
 
07:30:56.590 --> 07:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
properties it doesn't have and saying
 
07:30:57.910 --> 07:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing that will save us
 
07:31:00.868 --> 07:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
some people say ah
 
07:31:03.830 --> 07:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's not where my convictions lie I
 
07:31:05.990 --> 07:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe in something else and she should
 
07:31:07.788 --> 07:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
be able to do that without you know
 
07:31:10.830 --> 07:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
penalty or per and and
 
07:31:14.990 --> 07:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
Punishment followup so people I know
 
07:31:16.548 --> 07:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
there are people in the state I know
 
07:31:19.830 --> 07:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
there are people in other states who
 
07:31:19.840 --> 07:31:21.670 align:start position:0%
there are people in other states who
were

07:31:21.670 --> 07:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
were
 
07:31:25.350 --> 07:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
fired o and had asked for religious
 
07:31:29.190 --> 07:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
exemption what should they do okay so um
 
07:31:31.030 --> 07:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh without giving legal advice to
 
07:31:34.230 --> 07:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
anybody individually okay just speaking
 
07:31:36.990 --> 07:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
generally um if you have if somebody has
 
07:31:38.990 --> 07:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
for example um sought a religious
 
07:31:41.230 --> 07:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
exemption they have a limited period of
 
07:31:44.430 --> 07:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
time to file with the EEOC which is the
 
07:31:46.510 --> 07:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
or the state equivalent of the EOC and
 
07:31:49.708 --> 07:31:49.718 align:start position:0%
whatever state they're in a claim for
 
07:31:51.910 --> 07:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
for religious discrimination if they
 
07:31:54.110 --> 07:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
don't do that Unfortunately they could
 
07:31:57.070 --> 07:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
be bored from then bring a claim the EOC
 
07:31:58.468 --> 07:31:58.478 align:start position:0%
or the state equivalent typically has
 
07:32:00.230 --> 07:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
six months then investigate they will
 
07:32:02.670 --> 07:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
then issue a decision on whether they
 
07:32:04.230 --> 07:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
believe there has or has not been
 
07:32:06.628 --> 07:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination um at that point um the
 
07:32:08.990 --> 07:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know there's often a potential
 
07:32:11.308 --> 07:32:11.318 align:start position:0%
discussion with the employer and uh the
 
07:32:13.270 --> 07:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
council for the employee and if they
 
07:32:15.308 --> 07:32:15.318 align:start position:0%
can't resolve it the employee gets a
 
07:32:17.548 --> 07:32:17.558 align:start position:0%
right to sue letter and uh a case is
 
07:32:19.270 --> 07:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
brought in federal court and like I
 
07:32:21.510 --> 07:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have cases like that around
 
07:32:23.388 --> 07:32:23.398 align:start position:0%
the country uh we even have it against
 
07:32:25.750 --> 07:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies who fired
 
07:32:28.030 --> 07:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
employees for refusing roage exemptions
 
07:32:31.030 --> 07:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
are some interesting cases so absolutely
 
07:32:33.150 --> 07:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
I mean employees should be well aware
 
07:32:36.190 --> 07:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
that title 7 protects their right to
 
07:32:38.670 --> 07:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
have a religious uh to to to live their
 
07:32:40.670 --> 07:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
faith to live their beliefs and if they
 
07:32:42.750 --> 07:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
have a religious objection to
 
07:32:46.510 --> 07:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
vaccination title 7 um requires their
 
07:32:48.548 --> 07:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
employer to provide them a reasonable
 
07:32:50.708 --> 07:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
accommodation which was thankfully
 
07:32:52.190 --> 07:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
recently clarified of the US Supreme
 
07:32:55.070 --> 07:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
Court to be you know um they really have
 
07:32:57.548 --> 07:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
to try and accommodate those individuals
 
07:32:59.430 --> 07:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
I mean some of the folks that got fired
 
07:33:01.750 --> 07:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
are so ridiculous that we represent like
 
07:33:03.830 --> 07:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
they work from home they work from home
 
07:33:04.670 --> 07:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
and they're fire because they wouldn't
 
07:33:06.388 --> 07:33:06.398 align:start position:0%
get covid
 
07:33:08.468 --> 07:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
vaccine I mean you want to talk about
 
07:33:10.670 --> 07:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs wow that's that
 
07:33:12.628 --> 07:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
requires an amazing level of belief
 
07:33:14.070 --> 07:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
ideology you want to I don't know what
 
07:33:15.670 --> 07:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
you want to call it it's unfortunately
 
07:33:17.110 --> 07:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
these products can't just be treated as
 
07:33:18.990 --> 07:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
products that's what they are I can
 
07:33:20.510 --> 07:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
assure you they were not given to Moses
 
07:33:23.308 --> 07:33:23.318 align:start position:0%
at sin they are just products and you
 
07:33:26.110 --> 07:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
know and unfortunately they for I think
 
07:33:28.788 --> 07:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
for some folks um they have taken the
 
07:33:28.798 --> 07:33:30.510 align:start position:0%
for some folks um they have taken the
place

07:33:30.510 --> 07:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
07:33:32.948 --> 07:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
of uh Something to Believe In You know
 
07:33:35.548 --> 07:33:35.558 align:start position:0%
they maybe don't have a lot of uh uh
 
07:33:38.270 --> 07:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
things that and so you know they they
 
07:33:40.030 --> 07:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
really they believe in these products in
 
07:33:42.270 --> 07:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
a way that people have religion in other
 
07:33:45.150 --> 07:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
areas of life um and I I see it all the
 
07:33:47.830 --> 07:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
time um people get very upset and worked
 
07:33:49.548 --> 07:33:49.558 align:start position:0%
up when they talk about these products
 
07:33:51.468 --> 07:33:51.478 align:start position:0%
very quickly even though they're just
 
07:33:53.670 --> 07:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
products I i' love to see people get
 
07:33:56.510 --> 07:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
that excited about uh you know uh uh you
 
07:33:58.708 --> 07:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
know uh some other products anyway
 
07:34:02.990 --> 07:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:06.788 --> 07:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions I would
 
07:34:09.708 --> 07:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
truly like to thank you uh for being
 
07:34:14.750 --> 07:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
here today um I have learned so much
 
07:34:18.030 --> 07:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
um about vaccines and clinical
 
07:34:21.308 --> 07:34:21.318 align:start position:0%
trials um and you it's been a wealth of
 
07:34:22.948 --> 07:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
information and I think it will go a
 
07:34:26.628 --> 07:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
long way in assisting us with our report
 
07:34:31.070 --> 07:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
um for the state um so
 
07:34:33.468 --> 07:34:33.478 align:start position:0%

mean it's so important really I mean U
 
07:34:40.910 --> 07:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh what happened during the pandemic
 
07:34:42.150 --> 07:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
could have easily just been forgotten
 
07:34:43.788 --> 07:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
and everybody could have just moved on
 
07:34:45.270 --> 07:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
but you're not doing that you're looking
 
07:34:46.750 --> 07:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
back because if we don't learn from
 
07:34:48.468 --> 07:34:48.478 align:start position:0%
history as we all know we're bound to
 
07:34:50.150 --> 07:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
