education if somebody
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
speaks from the witness table on a bill
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
that means when they return to their
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
seat if they're on this committee they
 
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
are not uh allowed to ask questions of
 
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh others who testify but there is a
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
workaround which I explained the other
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
day and that is when I was on Health and
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
Human Services I was sitting next to Dr
 
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.550 align:start position:0%
Human Services I was sitting next to Dr
Jerry

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
Jerry
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
kerk and he introduced the bill and he
 
00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
was just sitting there dying to ask
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
questions so he handed me a note saying
 
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
ask this
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
question and all would have gone
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
smoothly but I did say Dr kerk and of
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
course a sentence in his handwriting
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
degenerated and I looked to him and said
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
Jerry what's that word and that kind of
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
gave it all away but generally speaking
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's the rule
 
00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
here so please introduce your bill to us
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm here to
 
00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm here to
testify

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
on uh House Bill 486 and I am the prime
 
00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor a constituent brought her issue
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
with real trouble she was having being
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
granted grandparents
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
visitation uh to me and asked me to look
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
at RSA
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
461a colon 13 as I started to Res search
 
00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
and speak with other grandparents and
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
people from organizations who help
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
grandparents I realized that there were
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
some changes to current law that really
 
00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
needed to be made I tread very lightly
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
because of my respect for parents rights
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
and didn't want to encroach on those
 
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
rights when I was trying to think of
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
language that would help grandparents I
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
was relieved and very thankful that two
 
00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 align:start position:0%
very active and influential parents
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
rights supporters signed in in support
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
of the bill so I believe I have
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
successfully accomplished that um what
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
did I do I added separate living
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
arrangements to circumstances to
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
supplement the circumstance of divorce
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
as we know divorces can take years and
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's not in the best interest of the
 
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.240 align:start position:0%
child to wait years to continue a
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
positive relationship with their
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
grandparents this could interfere with
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
the frequency of contact consideration
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
also depending on the interpretation of
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
divorce in this instance is it fair to
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
determine that grandparents should be
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
disqualified because they haven't seen
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
their grandchildren during the course of
 
00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:38.919 align:start position:0%
long divorce proceedings how do judge
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
judges determine what the definition of
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
divorce is in this case is it after the
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
final decree is it during the course of
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
the divorce it seems like there really
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
isn't one answer and it's open to a lot
 
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.350 align:start position:0%
isn't one answer and it's open to a lot
of

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation we've also seen a lot of
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
grandparents in New Hampshire raising
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
grandchild children as we know we see
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
them a lot here um in our committee and
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
I've seen estimates up to 12,000
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
grandparents currently who are raising
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
grandchildren in their homes and as we
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately a large contributing
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
factor to this huge population of
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
grandparents raising grandkids is due to
 
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
per parental drug abuse many
 
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
grandparents have temporary guardianship
 
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
for several months six or more at a time
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
and while the goal is often
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
reunification and we hope reunification
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
with the parent or parents is permanent
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
and successful the reality is that
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
recovery can be a bumpy road
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
grandparents can be going back and forth
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
from parents to grandparents as their
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
parents are battling their addictions
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining a positive relationship with
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
grandparents is crucial to the
 
00:09:46.829 --> 00:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
well-being of the child in situations
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
like this this is why I've added the
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
language in lines 15 16 and 17 this
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
language is in current legislation in
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
other states and it seems to be working
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
I found an AR and a help guide for
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
grandparents entitled help for
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
grandparents and Kinship Caregivers
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%

attachment and bonding long title sorry
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to read you a portion of
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
that article it does a great job
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
explaining why this is important and to
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
justify adding the lines I'm talking
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
about young children need to develop at
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
least one relationship with one primary
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%

sensitive and responsive to them and
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
remain constant early in their life this
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
person is their secure base children who
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
experienced a parents substance use
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
disorder may have felt abandonment due
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
to their parents absence or lack of
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
attentiveness to their needs and

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
their grandparent or k kin caregiver
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
develop an attachment to them the total
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
loss of that attachment person can cause
 
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
anxiety and grief in the child that's
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
why it's critically important that the
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
unification planning for the child must
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
include mechanisms to continue at least
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
one relationship with one the bond with
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
the grandparents or kidship Giver while
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
at the same time strengthening the
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
parental bond this shouldn't be a them
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
versus US type of
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
situation that's about it and I hope
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
I've communicated the need for these
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
changes enough for you to support the
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill and I would be happy to take
 
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
questions any questions representative
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
for presenting this bill and um for
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question what how did you come
 
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
on the time frame of uh the six months
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I researched
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh all of the law all the grandparent
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
visitation laws and that's in Statute in
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
other states including Arkansas exactly
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
how it's written and I had not found uh
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
there be any problem with that in those
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:12.519 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I'm
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
curious about um the stipulation that
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
the child has to have lived with the
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
grandparent for the grandparent to have
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
um visitation rights does does the
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
language change make that requirement or
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
can it still be a situation like I'm
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about a friend of mine who who
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
goes to her daughter's house every day
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
gets the children ready for school takes
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
them to school and then watches them
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
after school should something happen she
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
would probably want to continue to have
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
a relationship with those kids would
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
that still be something that a judge
 
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
that still be something that a judge
could

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
order or does because she doesn't
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
actually physically live with them does
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
the language change change that thank
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
you for your question um it doesn't
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
change um at all um it's just in
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%

against good- loving grandparents like
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
myself who seek visitations with good

where there is a genuine risk of abuse
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
and neglect in the house most
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
grandparents seek visitations as a way

of providing a Lifeline to the

grandchildren in case of adverse
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the children needing

to be reunited with their
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%

he granted me visitations no names no

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
hearings in which my daughter would not
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
comply and August 2024 we were scheduled
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
for a contempt hearing for
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
non-compliance of his visitation orders
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
and as I walked into the courtroom I was
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
ambushed with a new judge who i' had
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
never seen before and who I believe was
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
not familiar with our case history and
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
my daughter's attorney presented me with
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
a motion to dismiss that I had never
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
seen till that moment I was not given 10
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
days notice or any time to appeal my
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
contempt hearing now became into a

with two incarcerations in which I was

the primary caretaker of my
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and many dcyf
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
Assessments in
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
2019 when my daughter separated from her
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
husband my daughter and my
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
granddaughters came to live with me for
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
a year and a
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
half and during that time my daughter
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
became incarcerated for child
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
endangerment and I became the primary
 
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
caretaker of my two youngest
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
granddaughters who were only 1 and 2
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
years old at this time my daughter lost
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
custody of her eldest daughter to her
 
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
father but she would come and spend
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
almost every weekend with me and her
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
sisters my daughter to this day still
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
does not have custody to her eldest
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
daughter who's 12 years old
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
now after my daughter was released from
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
prison she moved into an apartment
 
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
upstairs from me with my two youngest
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
granddaughters so I would be close by to
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
help with the girls and be a constant
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
support for her well two years ago my
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
daughter suffered a second overdose on
 
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
heroin laced with fenol while my three
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
grandchildren were present in the home
 
00:19:33.789 --> 00:19:33.799 align:start position:0%
sleeping and as a result DCF placed the
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
girls in my
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
custody after providing nine months of
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
care during which the girls showed
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
remarkable improvements in their health
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
they were happy they were thriving and I
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
supported the reunification of my
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
daughter with her children
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
again immediately following this
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
reunification my daughter who was still
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
separated from her husband now restricts
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
all contact between myself and my
 
00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:00.909 align:start position:0%
all contact between myself and my
granddaughters

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
this judge based on his interpretation
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
of section one of the RSA stated because
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
I was restricted prior to the absence of
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
the nuclear family as in section one of
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
this RSA that I had no standing no
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
grounds for grandparent
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
visitations and he had no power to Grant
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
or enforce any visitations or writes to
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
me as a grandmother and he dismissed my
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
case and again that was his
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
interpretation after 18 months of
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
litigation even though I had two granted
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
visitations at two separate hearings
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
with the last being a final order with a
 
00:20:41.559 --> 00:20:42.750 align:start position:0%
with the last being a final order with a
visitation

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
visitation
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
schedule my daughter refused to
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
comply and was held in contempt but
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
there was never any consequences there
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
was no penalties no repercussions for
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliant and being in
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
contempt because my daughter was
 
00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
separated not divorced at the time that
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
she restricted me upon
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
reunification I have no recourse to ever
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
see my grandchildren again who I loved
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
and I nurtured their entire young
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
lives she is now divorced but I still
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
have no rights to petition the court for
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
visitations how is that fair to the
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
children who love their grandmother this
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
not only hurts me but it hurts my girls
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
emotionally being ripped away from me
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
they loving
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
Mimi they spent so many years with me
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the isolation and alienation it's
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
not fair to them it's not feir to me
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
family for the last 12 years I was
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
called Mimi and I no longer hear those
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
voices anymore nobody calls me Mimi any
 
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.310 align:start position:0%
voices anymore nobody calls me Mimi any
go

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
more and I'm grieving the loss of living
 
00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799 align:start position:0%
grandchildren that are just in the next
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
me in August
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
2024 7 months after reunification with
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
their mother I became aware that my
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
youngest 5-year-old granddaughter was
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
severely burned using the microwave
 
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
preparing her own mail while my daughter
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
bed this caused me great concern and
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
worry for my granddaughter's safety and
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
well-being I strongly support this bill
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
with recommended changes so that all
 
00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
grandparents have the right to
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
visitations and relationships with their
 
00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:29.070 align:start position:0%
visitations and relationships with their
grandchildren

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
and I urges committee to do the right
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
thing and pass this
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
bill other grandparents are suffering
 
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
bill other grandparents are suffering
like

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
myself and we just want to be a Lifeline
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
to our
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and in and unfortunately
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
when your child is involved with drugs
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
and alcohol they don't want the children
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
to be involved with the grandparents
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
because they're in fear they're in fear
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
the children will unknowingly say
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
something to the grandparent that could
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
get the into some trouble so it's fear
 
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
to isolate everybody so nobody has
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
access to what's going on in that home
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
and one of the pictures I showed you
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
that I passed out I went to go that was
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
a visitation I was supposed to go get my
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
granddaughters they didn't come out but
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
all the windows were boarded up with
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
cardboard boxes and sheets so my poor
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
grandchildren can't even see outside in
 
00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:23.029 align:start position:0%
grandchildren can't even see outside in
the

00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
daylight they can't see outside and I
 
00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't see in and two years she's had
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
time to brainwash them all against me
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
beloving grandmother I sacrificed so
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
many so many years and so much of my
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
time in energy on these beautiful little
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
girls to be ripped away from
 
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
me will you take questions from us yes
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely um you suggest some changes
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill we will vote on this bill at
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
some point and we could possibly make
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
changes do you have the suggested
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
changes WR out for us I don't at this
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
time but it was that current line that I
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
was restricted prior to the absence of
 
00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:09.799 align:start position:0%
the nuclear family because she
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
restricted me while she was separated
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
okay for any reason and he said the
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
court has no power to grant me
 
00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:18.919 align:start position:0%
visitations what you just said would be
 
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
very helpful if you wrote that out for
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
us okay uh absent that we grant you that
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
changes could be made but we will not
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
know how to make those Chang
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
we will vote the bill as we have it but
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you have specifics please get them to
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
us as soon as you can and then when we
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
go to discuss it in committee um it is
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
possible that an amendment could be
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
crafted thank you thank you uh

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
changes so
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here and
 
00:24:59.230 --> 00:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
sharing your very painful story um I
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
just wondered because I want to wrap my
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
head around the the legal side of this
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
did you appeal that decision because
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
with the first judge coming in then the
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
second was there any kind of app pellet
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
situation with that the first judge
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
granted I had two hearings temporary and
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
final at both hearings he granted me
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
visitations so I wasn't expecting it to
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
be a contempt here and we was I mean I
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't expecting it to be a a hearing to
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
dismiss my case it was supposed to be
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
for contempt and the case got
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
dismissed so no I did not appeal it
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
because I you didn't appeal the second
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
decision I didn't because the way he
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
said it in the law the law interprets it
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
he interpreted it that I have no rights
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
he had no power to grant me visitation
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
because the way the law was written I
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
was restricted prior to the absence of
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
the nuclear family and even though they
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
he had moved on in another relationship
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
and wasn't living in the house he
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
considered them a nuclear family
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
sure were you represented by council at
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
this hearing I was proos okay but the
 
00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
opposite was of councel yes with councel
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%

love dearly yes and I cannot imagine
 
00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:24.039 align:start position:0%
being alienated from them so I hear your
 
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
testimony and I feel your pain and I
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%

questions and I had one other thing to
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
lot of testimonies I lobbied this bill

in my heart and it means so much to me
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%

story he has gone through the exact same
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
thing as I have if you could read that
 
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
one specific testimony it might bring a
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
little more insight into the language in
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%

marriage our son was arrested he has PTS

been able to see his children since that
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
time but he would like us to be able to
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
see them we have continued to support
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
our daughter-in-law and grandchildren
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
emotionally spending any time we can
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
with them in early November we had all
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
three gr girls over for as sleepover and
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
everything was great we were supposed to
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
have them for our family Thanksgiving
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
that morning our daughter-in-law texted
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
and informed us that the girls were not
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
comfortable with us and that she would
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
not force them to see us she ignored our
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
request to have them for Christmas which
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
we previously told were told would be
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
fine we have gone to our granddaughter's
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
basketball games and the girls will now
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
not look at us or speak to
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
us our granddaughters are being
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
alienated from us and from our entire
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
family we have a very close-nit loving
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
family we have never said a word to them
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
against their mother and have only have
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
their best interest at heart we are
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
trying to obtain visitation with them to
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
repair the damage that has been done to
 
00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.190 align:start position:0%
repair the damage that has been done to
our

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
relationship however as the law is
 
00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
written now we have little hope of that
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
happening until their divorce is
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
finalized which could take a couple of
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
contentious outside of their parents my
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
husband and I have been the most
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
consistent and supportive presence in
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
our grandchildren's lives we're the only
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
ones who were ever allowed to Babys H
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
them or spend time with them her family
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
was not even involved in
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
that we ask that you and that you enact
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 486 to amend the criteria
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
for grandparent visitation so that we
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
can work at repairing that relationship
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and any questions
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you so much

thank you I have no more pink cards on
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
this so I
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
will conclude our hearing on House Bill
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
486 and we will uh put this one aside
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
for a week or two awaiting any further
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
information before we go to vote on
 
00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
it with that I open the hearing on House
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 320 an act relative to enforcement
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
of marital property settlements and
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
representative marel from our committee
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and at some point you owe me a pink card
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
um okay I'm sorry Mr chairman your
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
credit is good okay thank you I'll get
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%

00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
um thank you for allowing me to speak
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
beh I'm sorry thank you for allowing me
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
to speak on behalf of this bill um what
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
320 does is basically a couple of things
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
first um it plugs a hole in the current
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
law two things I'm passing around one is
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
um a copy of RSA
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
4816a which is the statutory factors
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
that a court that courts consider when
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
it makes property settlements and and um
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
what is missing is
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
basically House Bill 320 and I'll
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
explain why there is
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
no there is no statutory requirement
 
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
that any Court enforce any of its orders
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
that it makes once a decree has become
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
final now there's a would you say that
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
again because that is wow please yeah it
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
is wow and it's very unfortunate there
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge there is no statutory
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
requirement that a court enforce a final
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
decree when it becomes
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
final um I haven't seen it and I the on
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
the basis for this bill was a profoundly
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
disturbing experience that I have had in
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
a court in this in this state uh where a
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
court simply refused to enforce its
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
decree resulting in basically a um
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
resulting in um a uh a significant
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
deprivation of property and
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the Corum does not allow
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
me to go into the specifics of the case
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
publicly um I can tell you that the I
 
00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:09.879 align:start position:0%
can tell you that the decision to
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
enforce the decree uh was in part based
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
on activity which rose in which in black
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
and white terms Rose to the level of
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
perjury and was provable I can also tell
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
you it involved intentional conversion
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
of assets uh and the court when
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
presented with this evidence simply
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
declined to enforce its decree now
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between enforcement
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
and contempt and it's important that you
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
know the difference between the two
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
contempt is basically a vile is in in
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's basically a willful
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
or intentional violation of a court
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
order okay enforcement doesn't
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily involve
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
contempt uh contempt historically is
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
discretionary upon a court
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh so a court can find you in contempt
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
or not find you in contempt uh depending
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
on the circumstances and it's largely
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
discretionary and that's historical
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
since contempts have been in existence
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
when you look at HB when you look at 320
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
the elements that a court can consider
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
in whether or not to um whether or not
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
to enforce a decree are basically well
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
settled so I'm going to ask I'm
 
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
respectfully direct the committee's
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
attention to uh paragraph 7 uh line S
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry where in other words once a
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
decree becomes final uh that means no
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
more appeals are allowed or an appeal is
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
taken place or post trial or
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
postdecision motions have been resolved
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
there is basically nothing else to go on
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of further activity and that's
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
basically finality of judgment so when
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
you look at what would be invalid would
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
be whether a decree was either entered
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
into either by agreement of the parties
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
or by after a final hearing by a court
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
would be fraud deceit duress
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
impossibility okay misrepresentation
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
Mutual mistake undue influence or
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
subsequent illegality and that would be
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
shown by a preponderance of the evidence
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
now fraud duress deceit
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation Mutual mistake and
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
undo influence are well settled are well
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
settled reasons uh to set aside a
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
property decree in the state of New
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh you can go back case law
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
all the way back and you'll see that uh
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
basically if you want to look it up one
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
key case on that is De palatino from
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
1995 which recites in its case you know
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
historic precedent for setting aside a
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
decree based on that um I chose to add
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
some contract information because that
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
can become a contract so when you look
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
at the word impossibility in other words
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
if somehow it was entered into and
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent enforcement became impossible
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay or subsequent illegality those
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
might be reasons to not enforce a decree
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
to its terms uh an example of that for
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
example might be let's say
 
00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
hypothetically uh one of the agre one of
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
the agreed upon things was to um
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
transfer 10 cases of an imported Russian
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
vodka to be delivered two years down the
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
road and the thing becomes final well
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the United States
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
decides to ban the importation of
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
Russian vodka and all of a sudden
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
compliance is impossible okay or also
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
illegal if it becomes a criminal
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
activity to import Russian vodka so
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
those might be two defenses the rest of
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
it is when you look at it is basically
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
contract law okay which is a big part of
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
what goes on in agreements and decrees
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
which is the court shell fashion
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
remedies that place the parties in the
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
position as if the decree had been fully
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
performed according to its terms now uh
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
then this is important um and the reason
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
why is because if for some reason there
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be an adjustment courts can
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
fashion remedies that will put the
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
parties basically in the same position
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
um and can be done now the worst part of
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
this is is that you really do not have a
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
viable appeal going up to the New
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court if a court if a
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
court below simply declines to enforce
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
an order and that is
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
frightening um the other aspect of why
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
this thing is written the way it is is
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
because I think as we have seen on this
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
committee people need to learn how to
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
plead their cases Approximately 80%
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
of the people who go into court at least
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the family division one side of that
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
case is probably a self-represented
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
individual so in other words with this
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
clear and unambiguous language people
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
learn how to plead their cases
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
effectively so they know okay well
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
what's happened in this case why am I
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
here to enforce why am I here seeking a
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
contempt and what would the possible
 
00:39:24.309 --> 00:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
defenses that a court could accept would
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
be so you can argue your case
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
effectively and please it effectively
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
and that teaches and that basically
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
improves the administration of law the
 
00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
second aspect of it is is that courts
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
need to be on notice that their ability
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to enforce a decree okay is
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
is there uh so a court can simply look
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
at this and realize that it has to
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
Fashion remedies and uh that basically
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
put the parties in the position that
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
they were in if um
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh as if the as if the decree had been
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
fully performed and the nice part about
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
this language is is that it allows
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
parties whether this is a decree by
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
agreement or whether it is the result of
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
a the result of a contested matter that
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
they can argue the case effectively um
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so without this
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
statute I am afraid that since this has
 
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
happened at least once and in this
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
particular court uh that I can refer to
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
it's probably happened to other people
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so I don't I know I'm speaking for
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
at least one party and I think I'm
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
probably speaking for a lot of other
 
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
people who may have faced this problem
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
but have not been able to figure out how
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with it and uh without this
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
statute this kind of behavior can
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
continue you know one of the things that
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
in more controversial subjects
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
there's one way that courts look at it
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
and it's called Uh this is capable of
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
repetition yet evading review and uh
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's an often repeated thing in Prior
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court cases and this is
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
clearly capable of repetition and
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
evading review I'll be happy to take any
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions anyone has I'll start with a
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
couple as I'm prepping for
 
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.670 align:start position:0%
couple as I'm prepping for
elets

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
elets
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
okay the uh vodka example you used of
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
impossibility is that Force majour um no
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
actually it's not for well it could be
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
considered for yeah it could be
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
considered Force majure but you either
 
00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
have either you have subsequent
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
illegality of subject matter or
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
impossibility so it could be if the
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
importation was banned it might be
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
impossible to do it however if it also
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
became criminalized to possess Russian
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
vodka then it would be illegality of
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
subject matter and forc maure is not
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
second question when you say the uh you
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
prefer the word enforcement to contempt
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
because if I'm not mistaken is
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
contempt uh one has to prove intent and
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
that is very difficult to imp to prove
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
but enforcement is more discretionary
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
and it's on preponderance of evidence do
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
I have that correct um they are flip
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
sides of the same coin okay so for
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
example in New Hampshire there are are
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
lots of different definitions of
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
contempt but concisely put the consensus
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is contempt is usually
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
basically a willful act uh it's usually
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
an intentional refusal to comply with a
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
court order or a uh usually it's a
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
refusal to comply with a court order
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
okay and there's usually a willfulness
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
component to it uh previously we talked
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
about uh outlining the the elements of
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
contempt in New Hampshire in this
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
committee and uh the definition should
 
00:42:59.790 --> 00:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
be broadened but it's going to be
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
discretionary on the judge and I have
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
seen judges import case law okay from
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions in finding somebody
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
to be a contempt
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
okay that's true that's how much
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
discretion is in it um and this needs to
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
be done for predictability I'm sorry if
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm talking beyond your point um all
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
right having passed the practice elat
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
for family law I'm working on contracts
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
next any other
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
Grossman thank you chairman Pearson um
 
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
what I guess in like layman's terms sure
 
00:43:48.109 --> 00:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
how would this give the judge power now
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
they would be able to
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
enforce um if you can describe now what
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
would happen Okay so for example right
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
now a judge can simply pick up a
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
potential contempt or or similarly a
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
motion to enforce and bear in mind
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement doesn't necessarily have to
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
have the willfulness of a contempt and
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's the difference I want to clarify
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay um in some jurisdictions I'll muddy
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
the waters just a little in some
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions okay a negligent failure
 
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
to comply with an order is contemptuous
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
conduct okay but in New Hampshire we
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
favor the willfulness okay or the
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement can be whatever okay just
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
never got around to it so you're not
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
looking for a contempt you're looking to
 
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
looking for a contempt you're looking to
enforce

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
um so this would tell a judge okay this
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
is the elements now whatever is going on
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
here with the conditions precedent not
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
being in the way no duress No undo
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
influence uh no particular change of uh
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances blah blah blah blah blah
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
blah blah okay then the judge is going
 
00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
to have to look and say okay how do I
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
enforce a remedy okay how do I even
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
create a remedy which is what basically
 
00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
Equitable jurisdiction is all about that
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
puts the party in their positions as
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
they should be informed now let's carry
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
that this way for example let's assume
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
for the sake of discussion here that
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
somebody is awarded stock rights in the
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
context of the divorce and let's assume
 
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
that there is um and let's assume for
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
example that the stock rights are being
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
cashed in by the other party let's
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
further assume that that party Cashes in
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
the stock rights and due to subject due
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
to withholding on this on the stock
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
units says okay I'm giving you half of
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
what you're entitled
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
to and you say well I'm entitled to the
 
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
full amount that the court ordered me
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
and he says no it's withheld and but in
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
the meanwhile there is a remedy to be
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
done because what you can do if you're
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
in that situation is you can fill out
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
the appropriate tax forms okay which let
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
you deduct from your income the value of
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
the money that you
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
took okay now if you bring this to a
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
Court's attention why would a court
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
refuse to enforce it and actually pay
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
the party the money that they're owed
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
Court says not going to do
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
reviewable okay other
 
00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
sure thank you uh Mr chair and I wish
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
you luck on the
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
elets we rehearse this in um so I'm
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
trying I assume you're talking there's
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
two kinds of contempt in New Hampshire
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
criminal contempt and civil contempt
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
correct and you're talking about civil
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
contempt correct and in many
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and I've only dealt with
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
criminal contempt not personally
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
but um in many jurisdictions with civil
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
either incarcerate someone for failure
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
until they cure the contempt correct um
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
or to find them for each day each week
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
each month they don't cure the contempt
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
is that the case in New Hampshire uh yes
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh basically we do have civil contempt
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
and criminal contempt occasionally the
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
lines blur uh but generally speaking in
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
a civil contempt the contner holds the
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
key to the uh jailhouse door okay which
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
means that is when you purge yourself of
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
contempt uh by performing an act or
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
doing whatever you're supposed to do
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to let you out of jail and
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's assuming the contempt is so
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
egregious that the Court's going to put
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
the case on for a show cause hearing in
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is typically what
 
00:47:44.589 --> 00:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
happens as part of due process before
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
they decide to make an incarceration
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
decision criminal contempt for example
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be more like what happened to
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
Steve Bannon okay where he simply
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
refused to comply with the subpoena and
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
show up okay okay there's other examples
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
of criminal contempt which I did an
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
article on this for the New Hampshire
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
bar news um last year uh which predicate
 
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
it which preceded that bill and I'm
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
happy to provide it with you to give you
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
the definition if you need it followup
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
follow followup so in terms of enforcing
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the final property settlement why
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
isn't it effective for the judge to say
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
for every week you don't perform that
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
which you're required to do on the
 
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
property settlement I'm going to find
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
you $1,000 or $5,000 you know set an
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
amount like that isn't that a pretty
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
effective enforcement mechanism as it
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
currently exists it would be but it's
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
entirely discretionary on the court on
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
the part of a judge because remember the
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
power for contempt is entirely
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
discretionary what this does is that
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
this makes an important distinction you
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't have to be found in contempt under
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
this statute a proposed statute if
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
becomes law all you need to do is be
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
able to look to enforce a decree so you
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
can plead a contempt and the court can
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
find one of two things it can find that
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
a you are in contempt in the altern and
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
enforce it or the court can find there
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
was no willfulness here or it didn't
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
meet the elements that the court would
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
find relevant for contempt and simply
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
enforce the
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
decree and last followup yeah followup
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
um so really this comes down to at least
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the contempt context uh comes down to
 
00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.109 align:start position:0%
in the contempt context uh comes down to
um

00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
well let me take that back and rephrase
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
the question why not just have why not
 
00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
just take contempt out of it and just
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
have uh uh upon motion or petition by a
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
party for enforcement why do we need to
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
even have the words cont because they
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
are two because they are flip sides of
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
the same coin and so a court can either
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
find you in contempt the court has the
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
op so it gives two ways to plead a case
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
number one is is that if you don't think
 
00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's in contempt the person pleading the
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
plaint if or the petitioner in this case
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
can if doesn't think it's in doesn't
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
think it's a contempt or doesn't think
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
the Court's going to find them in
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
contempt they can plead to inforce okay
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
and the court has the and so that's why
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
it because there are two different
 
00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
causes of action within the law you can
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
seek to enforce your decree which isn't
 
00:50:17.549 --> 00:50:17.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily contempt or you can actually
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
file a contempt and say that this is not
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
only enforceable but it is also
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
contemptuous conduct on the part of the
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you and thank
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee and by the way if you look in
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
your handout you'll see the statute
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
where it fits and you'll also see what a
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
petition for contempt looks like okay
 
00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:52.549 align:start position:0%
petition for contempt looks like okay
and

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:01.230 --> 00:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have a five minute
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
recess in which case Republicans stay in
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
the room and Democrats follow the
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%

00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%

questions to be internal to the

committee or to the prime sponsor which
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
is effectively the same
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
thing would you wish to ask for the
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
questions of the Prime sponsor or would
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%

following up on your phone call HB 213
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
has been determined to have no fiscal
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
impact based on responses from the
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and
 
01:02:37.559 --> 01:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and

DHHS indicated that any Associated costs
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
could be absorbed within their existing
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
budget so does that take care of the

too concerned about harm
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
coming um to children so I will be
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
voting no on the UT to pass motion how
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
would you see harm coming to children
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
I would see PE
 
01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
people being afraid to report abuse or
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.870 align:start position:0%
 
malicious

01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
malicious
 
01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay anyone
 
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
else representative Petrino thank you Mr
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
chairman the way I read the uh bill it
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
seems that individuals who want to make
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
it anonymous uh call can still do so so
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
if they have malicious intent well they
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
can just remain anonymous however uh on
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
the other end of the phone uh the
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
individual will hear that potentially
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
there could be civil or criminal
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
penalties for any kind of faults and
 
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
that may be chilling to some and they
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
may be hesitant to move forward and that
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
right there I think would potentially
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
Put Some Children at Risk and even if uh
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking one child uh that's one
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
many representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um just as I did last uh
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
session I have some pretty strong
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
feelings about this bill and I also
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
understand the psychology of the people
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
that are going to think twice about this
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
the conscientious people that are going
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
to worry about is this malicious is am I
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
doing the right things are not the ones
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
that we would need to worry about anyone
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
anyway people that have malicious intent
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to do this anyway because
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
they don't care they're already doing
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
something that's illegal police reports
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
and stuff that's already illegal to file
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
a police report um I also want
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
to caution that we had testimony that
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
the previous uh DCF um what is it called
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
chair whatever so which was Joe ripsom
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
sat in here and said that he was okay
 
01:09:47.709 --> 01:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
with this he did not he actually sat in
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
here and said please don't pass this the
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
last time we had this bill let them
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
decide and decipher they would rather
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
get all the calls and not try to
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
prohibit calls from coming in we're
 
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
missing so many already let's let them
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
do their job that they're trained to do
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
and decipher these calls without you
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
know letting the public know that they
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
could be in trouble because even the
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
people that are not doing a maliciously
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
because of a good conscience and people
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
that have the best intentions they will
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
they will think that twice they will go
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
ah I don't know and that will make it
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
even more so I know because I've had to
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
I've had to make calls before um I know
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
that representative uh Vice chair D
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
Simon has also talked about her having
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
to make calls we're the ones that second
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
guess this bills like that make those
 
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
people second guess it more thank
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
chairman um so for me it really comes
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
down to because I've worked in a state
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
that has this law um but we have the
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate who the
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
legislature created to review how child
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
um welfare is happening in New Hampshire
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
and advise us to the potential impacts
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
of bills and how we can make things
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
better for kids and when the office of
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
the child advocate says that they're in
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to a bill I take that very
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
seriously um because they are our first
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
you know they are our
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
um well o I would say OverWatch right
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
they're the people who are um making
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
sure that there's oversight and so for
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
me um if the oversight agent says this
 
01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea um then I tend to
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
fall on the this is probably not a good
 
01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.390 align:start position:0%
fall on the this is probably not a good
idea

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh I I had a long conversation with
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
the uh the office of the child advocate
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
on a bill that was pending concerning
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
child neglect in house criminal justice
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and and this piece of this
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
that bill didn't relate to this but um
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh we got into the conversation about
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing and um she was very
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
persuasive to me that let's
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
not try and criminalize too much when it
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
relates to uh child neglect uh let's uh
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
let the parts of the system that is DCF
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
handle that kind of issue rather than
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
criminalizing it and it was pretty
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
me representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sensitive to um what people
 
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
have been talking about and I thought a
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
lot about this um I supported it last
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
time and I've done more research this
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
time um there are F false reporting
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
penalties in Most
 
01:12:57.550 --> 01:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
states and some states have
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
um laws that include fines and some
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
states have laws regarding this um that
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
include prison time we have red States
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
and blue States alike who have um
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
laws um that uh penalize individuals who
 
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.910 align:start position:0%
laws um that uh penalize individuals who
falsely

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
falsely
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
report California
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Michigan York Texas New
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
York um and we heard during testimony
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
that should New Hampshire create a law
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh penalizing false reporting that
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
people would be less inclined and and
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
afraid to report actual cases of abuse
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
which are concerns here in this room too
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
but there was no data that was provided
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
to those uh test from those testifying
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
to support that
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
statement um and there there was no
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
findings um that that occurred in other
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
states so that is why I am in support of
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
you since these comments seem to go very
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
much to the heart of the bill you know
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
some things you can amend all you want
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
but that's usually on the edges it seems
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
to me that all an amendment would do
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be to take this thing away the
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
choice really seems to me to be up or
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
down uh anybody
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
else representative D Simon thank you Mr
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
chairman with all due respect to
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
everybody who's spoken on both sides of
 
01:14:35.159 --> 01:14:36.350 align:start position:0%
everybody who's spoken on both sides of
this

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
issue uh I have called and reported and
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
yes I did think about the ramifications
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
if I was found to be um just considered
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
a troublemaker but it did not deter me I
 
01:14:54.629 --> 01:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
felt strong enough about the fact that a
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
child could be being
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
abused uh I was ready to accept any
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
consequences because I was on calling on
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
child so
 
01:15:11.709 --> 01:15:11.719 align:start position:0%
I just feel that since there is no data
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
to prove that it decreases the amount of
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate callers on the issue uh I can
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
still support the Bill thank
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman so U I
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
know all of our towns have those uh
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
Facebook pages where residents can kind
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
of chime in and uh so in Milford uh
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're no different and just recently
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
somebody had posted and I thought it was
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
an interesting post it said I heard a
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
little girl
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
screaming and I'm not sure what to do
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's any of my
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
business and I was just flawed when I
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
read that but 117 people at the time
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
chimed in and overwhelmingly people were
 
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
saying you have to make a call call the
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
police if you're worried you can be
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
anonymous and this one particular issue
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
was uncertain as to what to do and I
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
thought that was incredibly strange so
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is this there are some
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
people out there who are fearful to make
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
the call and if they know that maybe you
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
know inadvertently accidentally they say
 
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.590 align:start position:0%
know inadvertently accidentally they say
something

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
and there could be criminal civil
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
penalties they may be hesitant and that
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
one hesitancy could put a child at risk
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you I monitor the fire and
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
police channel for my home city in
 
01:16:45.629 --> 01:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a city of 40,000 people
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
and all day I'm hearing police go to a
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
certain place because a complaint has
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
been called in I I don't see that uh we
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
lack for it um I do know from talking to
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
police officers in my hometown that
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are people who do call in
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
anonymously and make false reports their
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
voices start to get
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
recognized and eventually action is
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
taken but it is not on the basis of one
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
citizen saying that child is running
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
around without a coat on what's the
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
matter with the mother and then the cops
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
come and discover oh it's Billy yeah he
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
he does that on the school playground
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
too it's not the mother it's Billy and
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
oh Mom was looking out the window and
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
then the process of coming
 
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
out where they move is if it is a very
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
clearly false report from a person who
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
regularly makes false reports at that
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
point they make an action they tell me
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
they do not take an action on
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
um a a sincere call fire departments get
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
sent out because somebody saw Steam and
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was Smoke there's no penalty
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
there it was an honest mistake and the
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
police would make this same
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
determination it is when it is clearly
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
malicious and repeatedly by the same
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
person whose voice is now familiar that
 
01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
action is taken I don't see that this
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
would um harm a child I think that if a
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
child is screaming and one person says I
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
can't call that in somebody else
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
probably just has or is about to I also
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
hear when police are dispatched to a
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
certain place the phrase receiving
 
01:18:36.159 --> 01:18:37.629 align:start position:0%
certain place the phrase receiving
multiple

01:18:37.629 --> 01:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
calls so um I do sympathize for the
 
01:18:44.629 --> 01:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
concerns of those speaking against the
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill but I'm going to vote for it
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
because I uh I think the potential harm
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
to people who are constantly complained
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
against overrides the theoretical
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
possibility one innocent child may be
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
harmed by
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
non-reporting I don't think those are
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
anyway equivalents anybody else want to
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
weigh in yes representative love thank
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh because we're making
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
a crime of false reporting uh wouldn't
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
that crime have to be proven um you know
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
just to just to add a little more to
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
what you just said um you know we have
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
to prove any any crime that and
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody is constantly doing it if
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
there's a a divorce going on and you
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
know they've got uh three family members
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
doing it uh you know you can you can put
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
that all together and uh and make a case
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
but if it's a mistake you know like like
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned a screaming kid I'm
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
sure the police or DCF would rather go
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
out and find out nothing's wrong then go
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
out and find out that uh this kid has
 
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
been abused and um I I just think we're
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're reaching here uh if we're
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
going to if we're going to vote against
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
this this I think this is a good bill
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
and to say
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
report was intentionally a false report
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
intentionality is a fairly High bar to
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
prove MH so those people who make an
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
honest mistake do not remotely rise to
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
the level of
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
intentionality and in particular when
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions say there's got to be
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
several of these intentional false
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
reports I think that is quite a high bar
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
counselor yes thank you Mr chairman yes
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
you're correct uh malice is basically
 
01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
the intent to injure and so since you
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
have to show the intent uh a good faith
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
error you you're not going to be able to
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
prove that Beyond A Reasonable Doubt in
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
court and I doubt law enforcement will
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
bring an action on that basis um you
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
know once again this is a matter of
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
intent and that malice standard is very
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
bar yes representative please just just
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh just for
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
clarification uh the individual who's
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
making the phone call I'm wondering if
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're aware of
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
that well if you're well basically
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be from the intent
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to be from the surrounding
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances okay and so for
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
example I think the chairman correctly
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
points out repeated instances if they're
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
targeted at the same person uh things
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh ma like I said malice is a really
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
high bar to prove criminally okay uh
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
this is not don't confuse it with strict
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
liability uh there are very few strict
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
liability almost no strict liability
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
crimes in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
save statutory rape okay uh so that
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
would be a high bar and not only that we
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
don't even have to deal with a re able
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
presumption here uh so I I think you're
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
safe if you vote this and um I I think
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
it won't probably deter somebody who was
 
01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
held bent on malice but it probably
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
would provide relief for somebody who
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
was the victim of M uh of repeated false
 
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
this representative rice thank you Mr
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
chairman so I'd like to point out though
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
that on page two of the bill line five
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
you have the ability it's already in law
 
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
to bring a civil action against someone
 
01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
from maliciously
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
law yes but this makes it this
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
criminalizes it that's a different
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
standard and civil liability is
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence in most
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
out follow up it's the criminality that
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
I worry about those that that that is
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
going to prevent people from calling
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
malici people who want to do malicious
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
reporting can still do it
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
anonymously and you have no way to find
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
out their information because they're
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
not giving
 
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
it it's my concern is the people that
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to prevent from calling
 
01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
I guess with all due respect if I may
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
respond Mr chairman I think that's going
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
to really depend on the level of the
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
sophistication of the actors uh you know
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
I think police when you call the police
 
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
I think the phone number comes up unless
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
you've got a block on it or whatever but
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
I think the chairman correctly points
 
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
out that when they get numerous multiple
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh calls uh they're able to figure out
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
what's going
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
on I doubt somebody making an honest
 
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
mistake would use a burner phone to make
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
this call
 
01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.070 align:start position:0%
this call
correct

01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.189 align:start position:0%
correct
representative

01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:23:59.199 --> 01:24:00.870 align:start position:0%
representative
sure

01:24:00.870 --> 01:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
um being a law professor I always trying
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
to could you stand a little closer to
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
your mic or could you put your mic a
 
01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
little closer to your mouth being a law
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
professor I always resort to research in
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
the absence of knowledge um uh RSA
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
6414 already criminalizes as a
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor of false report to law
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I'm I'm just not sure we
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
need putting aside all the other
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
arguments that have been made on both
 
01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
sides I'm just not sure we need this
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
6414 do you have it handy up on your
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
screen to read to us because I don't
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
want to walk to the back of the room and
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
look it up thank you uh I can read it if
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay a person is guilty of a misdemeanor
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
if he one knowingly gives or causes to
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
be given false information to a law
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer with the purpose of
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
inducing such officer to believe that
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
another has committed an offense or two
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
knowingly gives or causes to be given
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
information to any law enforcement
 
01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
officer concerning the commission of an
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
offense or the danger from an explosive
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
or other dangerous substance knowing
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the offense or danger did not occur
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
or existing or exists or knowing that he
 
01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
has no information related relating to
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
the offense or
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
charge the offense or danger what
 
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
strikes me about this is particularly
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
the second second paragraph has a
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
knowingly mental state rather than a
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
purposely mental state or a malicious
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
mental state which is which is easier to
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
prove you just have to know that you are
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
reporting something falsely um so I I
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
think there is not perfect overlap
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
between this and and what's proposed but
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
I think there's enough overlap that it
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
concerns me that uh this bill concerns
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
me in that way so it would be your
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
testimony that or your um observation
 
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.390 align:start position:0%
testimony that or your um observation
that

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
6414 pretty much covers what this bill
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
is trying to do it covers much of what
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do I it's again
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a perfect overlap but it's
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
significant overlap all right to give
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
you a um a leading
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
question then
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
6414 would cover much of the intent of
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
without the possible harm that people
 
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
have spoken to in your opinion that was
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
a leading
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
question yeah which I didn't understand
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
good but in other words I'll I'll answer
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
anyway if you want of
 
01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
anyway if you want of
course

01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
um now rephrase your question please
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
asud existing law
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
covers most of what the bill
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
wants to do yes but existing law doesn't
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
have the little negative that people
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
bill corre as a deterrent of some people
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
calling I think dysfunctions as a enough
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
of a deterrent that we don't need to
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
have a whole separate statute I I tend
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
not to be a big fan of plugging little
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
holes as opposed to plugging big holes
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a plugging a little
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
hole given the existence of
 
01:27:30.910 --> 01:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
6414 okay representative
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman um the
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative's discussion concerning
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh was it
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
64 one one uh
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
that the only thing that concerns me
 
01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:49.390 align:start position:0%
that the only thing that concerns me
about

01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
um relating the two is that that 641
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
specifies to
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
police in a court of
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
is suing another person for falsely
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
reporting to DHHS or DCF it could be
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
argued that 641 only specifies police
 
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
and does not include dcy Alpha DH h s
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
and it could deter the court from uh
 
01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
making a determination in that
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
case does that make sense to anybody
 
01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.590 align:start position:0%
case does that make sense to anybody
else

01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:28:40.350 --> 01:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
yes yeah representative marel yes I
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate um fellow council's comments
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
the difference here that I see I Echo
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
what uh Vice chair says about reports
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
not other than other than law
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement but without this what you do
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
is you're able uh
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
I think you're able to raise Reasonable
 
01:28:58.990 --> 01:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
Doubt about your actions um if you're
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to have conflicting
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
statutes on point uh so in other words
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
assume for the sake of argument that uh
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
law enforcement brings an action based
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
on 641 okay and says false reports I've
 
01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
had those cases um now all of a sudden
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's asserts that they are immune
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
from Criminal prosecution because no I
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
was dealing with child abuse and uh this
 
01:29:27.950 --> 01:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
is a false report but that's but what
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
you're doing is you you have two
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
problems first of all I'd be making an
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
over breath argument particularly where
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
I have conflicting statutes one which
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
IMU immunizes me okay uh because I I'm
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
making absent this statute I'm making a
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
report about what I suspect to be child
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
abuse whatever my true motives are I'm
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to conceal from the police but all
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
of a sudden when confronted with a
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss uh I'm going to I'm
 
01:29:58.830 --> 01:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to say that I don't
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
think you would be able to bring prove
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
your case Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to assert liability
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
immunity from liability for a report I
 
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
made to law enforcement also DCF so if
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
I'm calling DCF and not law enforcement
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
the statute's going to be if it goes out
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
the other way I think you're looking at
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
a constitutional issue about over breath
 
01:30:24.189 --> 01:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
and uh criminalizing whatever the
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
conduct would be that's how I'm looking
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
at it so I think you got I I think you
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
have I I I think it I would agree with
 
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
the chairman I think
 
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
it does no harm I think it probably
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
helps rather than hurts and it probably
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
so that's just my view having her a
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
defense Council
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
prosecutor well that makes me nervous um
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
I in a sense with all due respect I
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
think you make my point conflicting
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
statutes create more of a mess than one
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
statute well then that would be uh that
 
01:30:59.910 --> 01:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be the point of criminalizing it
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
under both statutes so in other words I
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
have a client who comes in and says help
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
I've been charged with uh making a false
 
01:31:11.109 --> 01:31:11.119 align:start position:0%
report to a police uh RSA 641 whatever
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm going to say who did you
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
call you called the police why a
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
suspected child abuse okay and you're on
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
a motion to dismiss uh my client is is
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
is subject to uh is subject to immunity
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
for making a good faith for making a
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
report case can't be proven Beyond A
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt number one number two
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
is it uh the historic purpose of
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice is my right to raise a
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable doubt about my client's guilt
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
and I think a Court's going to have to
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
come down on that and I'm going to get a
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think I'll get a dismissal on that
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
basis respectfully
 
01:31:45.719 --> 01:31:49.070 align:start position:0%
basis respectfully
put

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
wow and Aaron krian said if I was a
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%

01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
chair uh not related to the elsat
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh I I I if I need to leave by 10 of
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
12 um I don't know if you're going to
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
exec anything more but I don't want to
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
no um that you need to leave by 10 to 10
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
to 12 we've got 10 minutes more or 20
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
minutes more of your company but done
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
for the morning we're not going to exact
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
anything else looking at the pain
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
Expressions on most people's face when I
 
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
talk I uh I'm not sure not sure they
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
want 10 more minutes the second question
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
is the second question is I can be back
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%

bills this afternoon we'll see I mean if
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
there ones we don't if we are pretty
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
much of consensus do we do we have
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
anything more we likely uh we've got 350
 
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.750 align:start position:0%
anything more we likely uh we've got 350
and

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%

uh thank you and if we're going to exec
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
and uh it's going to be that close I
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
doubt if the bill is going to be that
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
close we would execute because if it's
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
that close at least one group if not
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
both groups want to do some more
 
01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
thinking and arm twisting and whatnot
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%

shall Report with a positive
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation any bill or resolution
 
03:00:18.590 --> 03:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
which would if enacted be of violation
 
03:00:20.670 --> 03:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
of any article of the Constitution of
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or of the United States of
 
03:00:25.750 --> 03:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
America or Grant broad rule making
 
03:00:28.910 --> 03:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
authority to an agency or Department the
 
03:00:30.870 --> 03:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
vice chairman or another member of each
 
03:00:33.229 --> 03:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
committee shall review all pending
 
03:00:37.030 --> 03:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and shall advise the members
 
03:00:39.469 --> 03:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
of all legislation before the committee
 
03:00:41.150 --> 03:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
which should be reviewed in terms of
 
03:00:47.150 --> 03:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
this role her review statement to me is
 
03:00:49.550 --> 03:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
advice it is not a
 
03:00:53.190 --> 03:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
ruling and when I forwarded that to
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
everyone it is advice the chair can make
 
03:00:59.830 --> 03:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of rulings this is not one of them
 
03:01:03.229 --> 03:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
I do not rule on the
 
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionality the presumption is
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
that any bill that comes before us is
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional If the vice chair or the
 
03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:14.110 align:start position:0%
constitutional If the vice chair or the
chair

03:01:14.110 --> 03:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
say don't think so that is a personal
 
03:01:20.349 --> 03:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
opinion not a
 
03:01:24.150 --> 03:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
ruling when we come to exec the bill if
 
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
you don't think the bill is
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional then you should vote in
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
the negative if you do not think it's a
 
03:01:32.950 --> 03:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
problem you can vote either way
 
03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
whichever you
 
03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
wish where this is challenged
 
03:01:40.349 --> 03:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
initially will be the speaker's office
 
03:01:42.269 --> 03:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
and we will talk with the speaker if we
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
have some
 
03:01:46.990 --> 03:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
concerns after that the people who rule
 
03:01:50.349 --> 03:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
on the constit tionality of something is
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
the courts not here so therefore the
 
03:01:58.190 --> 03:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
chair will not entertain anybody saying
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
well you've got to stop this because
 
03:02:04.389 --> 03:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's in unconstitutional I cannot make a
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
ruling that way I can go forward and if
 
03:02:10.469 --> 03:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
I happen to agree with you I'll vote no
 
03:02:12.590 --> 03:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
did I miss
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
anything no Mr chairman I don't think
 
03:02:18.229 --> 03:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
you you have but I will tell you that
 
03:02:23.150 --> 03:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman has made sure that uh
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
he has more than once asked me to make
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
sure that any legislation that comes
 
03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
before us is in my opinion
 
03:02:36.349 --> 03:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh I have yet to find a
 
03:02:38.309 --> 03:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that has come
 
03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
across our desks that I have an opinion
 
03:02:44.229 --> 03:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
that it could be deemed
 
03:02:46.269 --> 03:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but I just wanted to
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate we as let legislators in this
 
03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
room and take an oath to uphold the
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
United States
 
03:02:56.790 --> 03:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution the state of New
 
03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:58.750 align:start position:0%
Constitution the state of New
Hampshire's

03:02:58.750 --> 03:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution those two constitutions we
 
03:03:05.830 --> 03:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
follow the next thing we follow are
 
03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:07.830 align:start position:0%
follow the next thing we follow are
house

03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
rules and then after that comes the laws
 
03:03:13.790 --> 03:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
that we make and the laws that we amend
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
and the laws that we
 
03:03:19.030 --> 03:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
change that's how we are to run our
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
legislative lives and that to the best
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
of their ability and we work together as
 
03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:25.349 align:start position:0%
of their ability and we work together as
a

03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
team reasonable people however can have
 
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion as to whether a
 
03:03:33.710 --> 03:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill is constitutional or not so I
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
reiterate she does not make a ruling I
 
03:03:40.710 --> 03:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
do not make a ruling I will continue
 
03:03:43.110 --> 03:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
with any bill that has been given to me
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
I will not stop I am not allowed to stop
 
03:03:49.870 --> 03:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
when we exec a bill that is when the
 
03:03:52.269 --> 03:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
question of constitutionality can be
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
raised by
 
03:03:57.269 --> 03:03:57.279 align:start position:0%
individuals and an individual believing
 
03:04:00.670 --> 03:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
it is unconstitutional should vote no
 
03:04:02.429 --> 03:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
others may vote however they like the
 
03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill or don't like the bill after that
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
it is out of the committee's control so
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
I would please ask people who come to
 
03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
testify uh you may State your
 
03:04:17.150 --> 03:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
opinion however your opinion is more
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
likely to be believed if you can point
 
03:04:24.750 --> 03:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to where that question in
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
either Constitution is raised if you
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
make a broad statement saying it's
 
03:04:31.710 --> 03:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional you will convince no
 
03:04:34.349 --> 03:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
one but if you can point to a certain
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
line item then it is up to each one of
 
03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
us to decide have you proven your case
 
03:04:43.309 --> 03:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
you say this line in the Constitution
 
03:04:45.950 --> 03:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
and this bill are at odds it will be up
 
03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
to each individual to decide
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's true or not so there it
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
is and everybody up and down the line
 
03:04:57.429 --> 03:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
apologizes for any confusions I will
 
03:05:00.510 --> 03:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
have to leave partway through uh about
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
120ish because I am introducing two of
 
03:05:06.030 --> 03:05:06.040 align:start position:0%

hearings be video and audio recorded and
 
03:05:29.790 --> 03:05:29.800 align:start position:0%

post thank you chairman Pearson and
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
members of the child and family law
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:05:45.790 --> 03:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
representative kitlyn cab and I am here
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill for the prime
 
03:05:51.190 --> 03:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor onor Lisa post who could not be
 
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
here when this bill was initially
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
introduced the purpose of the bill was
 
03:05:59.389 --> 03:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
to provide transparency into the family
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
court proceedings and to have audio and
 
03:06:03.510 --> 03:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
video recordings of the
 
03:06:05.309 --> 03:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
non-confidential proceedings in the
 
03:06:05.319 --> 03:06:06.790 align:start position:0%
non-confidential proceedings in the
Family

03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
Family
 
03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
Division however after it was
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
implemented I worked with rep post to
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
talk with the court about it and there
 
03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
were really quite a few concerns with it
 
03:06:21.309 --> 03:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
and so we'd like to work with the court
 
03:06:24.670 --> 03:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
to potentially amend this into a pilot
 
03:06:26.910 --> 03:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
program instead and I want to give some
 
03:06:30.150 --> 03:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
specifics on what those concerns were so
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
for example there might be private bench
 
03:06:35.710 --> 03:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
conversations and there is no staff in
 
03:06:36.910 --> 03:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
many of the courtrooms that are
 
03:06:40.269 --> 03:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
available to mute the
 
03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
microphones and we wouldn't want those
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
private convos to be
 
03:06:46.990 --> 03:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
recorded and also you may have prosay
 
03:06:49.229 --> 03:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
parties in the family cases that may
 
03:06:51.030 --> 03:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
reveal some of their child's private
 
03:06:52.830 --> 03:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
confidential medical information that we
 
03:06:55.389 --> 03:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be
 
03:06:58.269 --> 03:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
included and with 32 Court locations
 
03:06:59.870 --> 03:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
they're just there aren't staff in each
 
03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:02.120 align:start position:0%
of those courtrooms so the purpose of
 
03:07:04.750 --> 03:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
the pilot program would be to see how
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
often these are requested how hard is
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
how difficult is it for this to happen
 
03:07:12.229 --> 03:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
test out the equipment that that might
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
be used for it to see is this it does
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
this equipment work
 
03:07:18.590 --> 03:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
well they would like lik have to do some
 
03:07:20.790 --> 03:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
sort of potential redactions as these
 
03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
are requested if there were to be
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
confidential information revealed within
 
03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:29.550 align:start position:0%
confidential information revealed within
them

03:07:29.550 --> 03:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:32.870 --> 03:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
so uh we're still kind of trying to work
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
through what might work so if possible
 
03:07:37.990 --> 03:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to request if we could if you
 
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
guys could not exec the bill yet to give
 
03:07:42.790 --> 03:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit of time to try and work
 
03:07:45.309 --> 03:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
together with the court to see if
 
03:07:46.750 --> 03:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's a potential pilot we might be
 
03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
able to write
 
03:07:51.150 --> 03:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
recommend because this is an early Bill
 
03:07:52.670 --> 03:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh we've got to get it out the door here
 
03:07:56.590 --> 03:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
on March 6th so for your scheduling
 
03:07:56.600 --> 03:07:58.590 align:start position:0%
on March 6th so for your scheduling
purposes

03:07:58.590 --> 03:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
um we would probably execute on the 6th
 
03:08:03.150 --> 03:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
the previous week is New Hampshire
 
03:08:04.990 --> 03:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
school vacation week and we're pretty
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
well booked up for the next couple of
 
03:08:08.590 --> 03:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
weeks anyway so if you can get it here
 
03:08:11.229 --> 03:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
by March 6 we'll take a look at it thank
 
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I've already heard some
 
03:08:23.150 --> 03:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions on this
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:30.359 --> 03:08:32.349 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:08:32.349 --> 03:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:08:35.070 --> 03:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
okay chair recognizes representative
 
03:08:35.080 --> 03:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
okay chair recognizes representative
Erica

03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you Mr chairman for the
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Erica Leon I represent
 
03:08:49.469 --> 03:08:49.479 align:start position:0%
the town of as well as a couple of the
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
members of this committee so I'm glad to
 
03:08:53.790 --> 03:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
be in front of all of you
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
today I am a co-sponsor of this bill
 
03:08:58.670 --> 03:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
because right now there's not a lot of
 
03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
confidence that everything that happens
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom actually makes it to
 
03:09:05.309 --> 03:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
the record um I had a family contact me
 
03:09:07.510 --> 03:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
stating that their parole officer had
 
03:09:08.750 --> 03:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
testified that they had actually come
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
and visited a child right after they had
 
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
supposedly assaulted the child the
 
03:09:15.870 --> 03:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
parole officer came in spoke in the
 
03:09:18.389 --> 03:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
courtroom and that never actually make
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
made it into the record um there's been
 
03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
a number of times where what we hear
 
03:09:27.670 --> 03:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
from people isn't the same as the record
 
03:09:29.710 --> 03:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
and we need to have a way to determine
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
what is true and what is not right now
 
03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're stuck in a lot of um he said she
 
03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
said I know that that's something that
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
this committee deals with a lot but I
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
think it's absolutely critical that
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
we're able to that there is able to be a
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
record made of the proceedings
 
03:09:50.030 --> 03:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's not subject to the same human
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
error that minutes can be subject to
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about families and
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people's children
 
03:09:57.950 --> 03:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about potentially having
 
03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
exculpatory evidence that is heard and
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
stated in the courtroom but is not
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
entered into the record leaving children
 
03:10:07.870 --> 03:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
separated from their parents when there
 
03:10:10.269 --> 03:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
really is no good reason for that to
 
03:10:12.269 --> 03:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
happen because somebody has come in and
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
said no I saw that child after that
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
incident and there's somebody that this
 
03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
state in this court the state and the
 
03:10:21.150 --> 03:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
Court's trust because they are a parole
 
03:10:25.269 --> 03:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
officer so I'm interested to see what
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative kutab has done with this
 
03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill as a co-sponsor I hadn't heard
 
03:10:31.349 --> 03:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
anything yet about this um what I do
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
want to do is make sure that we have the
 
03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
information and we can stop we can stop
 
03:10:37.200 --> 03:10:38.670 align:start position:0%
information and we can stop we can stop
this

03:10:38.670 --> 03:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
um we can stop trying to have to resolve
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
these disputes When people's children
 
03:10:45.150 --> 03:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
are taken from them without as much
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
information as those families want to
 
03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
make available to us because if they
 
03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
choose to have this information recorded
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
they're already willing to have it known
 
03:10:55.389 --> 03:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
that some the state's trying to take
 
03:10:57.150 --> 03:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
their children from them they're already
 
03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
ready to have it known all of the awful
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
things that will be said in those
 
03:11:03.070 --> 03:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
hearings and they think that it's
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
important enough to be able to do that
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
publicly so that they can make sure that
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
Justice is served and I think that we
 
03:11:15.710 --> 03:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
owe them the ability to make sure that
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
what is said in court is recorded in
 
03:11:20.030 --> 03:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
court and that children aren't separated
 
03:11:22.710 --> 03:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
from families unnecessarily and also
 
03:11:24.269 --> 03:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
that families aren't kept with parents
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
who are causing harm either this goes
 
03:11:29.550 --> 03:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
both ways we need to make sure that we
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
are prioritizing the children both in
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
their safety and in their security of
 
03:11:35.630 --> 03:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
staying with loving families so with
 
03:11:37.710 --> 03:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to take any
 
03:11:39.950 --> 03:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:11:42.389 --> 03:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
rice thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:11:44.750 --> 03:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question nowhere in here do I
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
see a time limit as to how long the
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is supposed to hold on to
 
03:11:50.150 --> 03:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
recordings and what and then determining
 
03:11:56.950 --> 03:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
how long they have to hold on to these
 
03:11:59.070 --> 03:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
do they have the storage capacity to
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
keep these and how much more is that
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to cost us well thank you for
 
03:12:05.389 --> 03:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
those questions they're very good points
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
and since it looks like there's an
 
03:12:08.349 --> 03:12:08.359 align:start position:0%
already amendment in the works that
 
03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
would be good to make sure that we
 
03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
include in this as well however it moves
 
03:12:13.070 --> 03:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
forward and I appreciate you raising
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
those concerns because those are
 
03:12:18.830 --> 03:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
important thank you representative patri
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:12:21.790 --> 03:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious as to the rationale
 
03:12:26.830 --> 03:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
behind the live broadcasting of the
 
03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings um thank you for that
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
question um we also have the issue where
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
if somebody's able to watch then they're
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
able to see what's going on
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
um it's always a challenge to figure out
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
how to do this but if a family wants to
 
03:12:41.469 --> 03:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
say this is what's happening to me I
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
want to have eyes on what is happening
 
03:12:45.229 --> 03:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
in court that's why you would have a
 
03:12:47.309 --> 03:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
live broadcast as you know here we have
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
do have a time delay so there I'm sure
 
03:12:51.870 --> 03:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
that I would expect that this would be
 
03:12:54.550 --> 03:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
subject to administrative rules um
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that DCF I guess this isn't DCF
 
03:12:59.190 --> 03:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
but I actually couldn't even find the
 
03:13:01.550 --> 03:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
DCF administrative rules which is
 
03:13:03.790 --> 03:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
troubling um but this would be subject
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
to administrative rules and by doing
 
03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to have
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
something like perhaps there's an
 
03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
emergency pause button just like
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
security has here if something goes
 
03:13:14.590 --> 03:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
wrong with the recording that there may
 
03:13:16.590 --> 03:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
be some times when they say well we need
 
03:13:19.269 --> 03:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
to stop this this ride right here um and
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
I would be amimal to that idea of being
 
03:13:22.670 --> 03:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
able to pause something if something
 
03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
truly potentially harmful is happening
 
03:13:31.630 --> 03:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.750 --> 03:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
along representative rice thank you Mr
 
03:13:36.550 --> 03:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for taking my
 
03:13:36.560 --> 03:13:38.389 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you again for taking my
question

03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
so these hearings have a lot of
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
confidential information a lot of times
 
03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
they have to do with children and I'm
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
just concerned that live broadcasts or
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
information to the public out there
 
03:13:54.269 --> 03:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
could cause a child irreparable harm
 
03:13:59.030 --> 03:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
especially by classmates or um you know
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
their peers that sees this going on and
 
03:14:05.389 --> 03:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
then they're getting backlash how would
 
03:14:07.469 --> 03:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
we prevent that from happening well
 
03:14:08.910 --> 03:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I wish we
 
03:14:10.910 --> 03:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
weren't in a position where we needed to
 
03:14:13.229 --> 03:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
have this right now we also have the
 
03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm of having children
 
03:14:17.070 --> 03:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
taken from their parents when there's
 
03:14:19.349 --> 03:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
fatory evidence presented in court
 
03:14:21.630 --> 03:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
saying that the allegations cannot in
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
fact be true yet that child is still
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
separated from their parents and from
 
03:14:27.150 --> 03:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
their family and from their support
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
system and sometimes even from their
 
03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
schools um I wish we weren't at the
 
03:14:32.389 --> 03:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
situation where we're looking at live
 
03:14:34.790 --> 03:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
streaming these court cases but families
 
03:14:36.429 --> 03:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
are being failed on both sides of the
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
coin both um when children are harmed
 
03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
and when children are taken needlessly
 
03:14:44.590 --> 03:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
because that causes harm too um it's not
 
03:14:46.429 --> 03:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
a perfect solution but neither is taking
 
03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
a child when when they should not be
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
taken from their
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
home representative
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
Coran thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:14:58.550 --> 03:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
you for being here um I hear you saying
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
that this will be an optin type of
 
03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
situation and not necessarily recording
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
case um thank you for the question as I
 
03:15:11.279 --> 03:15:11.830 align:start position:0%
case um thank you for the question as I
was

03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:13.830 align:start position:0%
was
[Music]

03:15:13.830 --> 03:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
looking that was my understanding as we
 
03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
were working through the langage of the
 
03:15:19.870 --> 03:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
bill that this would be on request of
 
03:15:21.790 --> 03:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
the families because if this isn't on
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
request of any of the parties involved
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
then that would be a huge violation of
 
03:15:28.110 --> 03:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
privacy however allowing a family to opt
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
into that is what my intention was in
 
03:15:32.550 --> 03:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsoring the bill and that was
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
language that I had reviewed um it's
 
03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
possible that it's possible that I had
 
03:15:38.830 --> 03:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
read the intentions more than what the
 
03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
language was but I in no way intend for
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
anything to be made public unless
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
somebody is standing there and saying I
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
I want this to be broadcast because I
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
people I want people to know the truth
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:15:55.870 --> 03:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
process when I look at lines uh 12 and
 
03:15:59.550 --> 03:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
13 of the bill um The Family Division
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
shall broadcast live if requested to do
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
so by the
 
03:16:08.510 --> 03:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or defendant or named
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative that sounds like one
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
party can request it and it will be so
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see that this means if one
 
03:16:20.429 --> 03:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
party objects it shall not be
 
03:16:23.229 --> 03:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for finding that section
 
03:16:24.750 --> 03:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
and then if you look below that it says
 
03:16:26.269 --> 03:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
the presiding judge shall Grant the
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
request unless the opposing party show
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
or representative shows by a
 
03:16:31.990 --> 03:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence that the
 
03:16:33.830 --> 03:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
broadcast is more likely than not to
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
cause specific specific irreparable harm
 
03:16:38.710 --> 03:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
to a party or witness and upon that
 
03:16:40.030 --> 03:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
showing then they wouldn't show those
 
03:16:42.229 --> 03:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
parts that would cause harm um and that
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
the judge will state the basis for that
 
03:16:46.110 --> 03:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
but that person has to prove
 
03:16:48.950 --> 03:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
preponderance of
 
03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
evidence is what I'm reading um I think
 
03:16:54.229 --> 03:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
that it's important to have some sort of
 
03:16:56.030 --> 03:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
guard rails because if you were able to
 
03:16:57.630 --> 03:16:57.640 align:start position:0%
say I think that somebody might might
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
bully this kid if they find out that
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
their family is in family court and
 
03:17:03.790 --> 03:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
right now you have a family that's
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
trying to stay together because of
 
03:17:07.269 --> 03:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
potentially false allegations and they
 
03:17:09.710 --> 03:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
have somebody in order to um dispute
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
that with uh very clear evidence
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
especially somebody that it would be
 
03:17:17.070 --> 03:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
normally respected by the court that the
 
03:17:18.790 --> 03:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
other side shouldn't be able to silence
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
that just because they don't want that
 
03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
part heard we are in the situation where
 
03:17:24.590 --> 03:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
very well-intentioned people are trying
 
03:17:26.910 --> 03:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
to do the best they can for families and
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
families are trying to also keep
 
03:17:31.229 --> 03:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
themselves Inta intact there will always
 
03:17:33.229 --> 03:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
be emotions there will always be
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
personal feelings that that come into
 
03:17:37.269 --> 03:17:37.279 align:start position:0%
play as much as people try and stay
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
neutral and unbiased and um because most
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
of the people involved in these family
 
03:17:45.229 --> 03:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
courts and in this really really truly
 
03:17:47.550 --> 03:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
want the best for these children
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
um they may sometimes not see things the
 
03:17:51.750 --> 03:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
same way as another person would or
 
03:17:53.750 --> 03:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
another party would so having the judge
 
03:17:56.830 --> 03:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
specifically say why something won't be
 
03:17:58.670 --> 03:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
broadcast will give us much clearer
 
03:18:01.349 --> 03:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines around that and have that
 
03:18:04.229 --> 03:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
transparency representative D
 
03:18:06.510 --> 03:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and thank you
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
again for coming here today uh you this
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill talks about uh recording and
 
03:18:16.830 --> 03:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
broadcasting the proceedings to whom
 
03:18:20.189 --> 03:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
will these proceedings be
 
03:18:23.189 --> 03:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
broadcast on lines 19 and 20 the link to
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
the live broadcast shall be available to
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
the public through the clerk's office at
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
the location where the proceeding takes
 
03:18:31.910 --> 03:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
place followup thank you will you take a
 
03:18:34.110 --> 03:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
followup yes thank you for taking a
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
followup in that particular case um that
 
03:18:39.229 --> 03:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to be broadcast to all of
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
those people um if a person who is to be
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
cross-examined by uh one or the the
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
other attorney and that person says I
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
don't want my testimony broadcast what
 
03:18:56.349 --> 03:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
happens then um well thank you for that
 
03:18:58.750 --> 03:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
question the point is we're trying to
 
03:19:00.750 --> 03:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that children are only removed
 
03:19:03.150 --> 03:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
from the families for good reason um
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at this if they're
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
if they're already testifying then
 
03:19:07.189 --> 03:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's already known that they are
 
03:19:09.389 --> 03:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
testifying the question is why would
 
03:19:11.590 --> 03:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
they why would you not want to have your
 
03:19:14.670 --> 03:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
testimony shared if you are truly
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
speaking on the best interest of the
 
03:19:18.269 --> 03:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
children and best interest of the child
 
03:19:21.550 --> 03:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
because we understand that it we
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
understand that there's judgment calls
 
03:19:25.269 --> 03:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
that come into play but transparency
 
03:19:26.830 --> 03:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
around this is very important and that
 
03:19:28.269 --> 03:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
helps for other people to understand
 
03:19:30.389 --> 03:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
where that line is and understand what
 
03:19:31.990 --> 03:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
is and isn't
 
03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:38.229 --> 03:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so understanding
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
the sensitive nature of Family Court
 
03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings also understanding the fact
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
that sometimes people who are complicit
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
in abusive behaviors don't understand
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
that what the judicial branch has is a
 
03:19:56.309 --> 03:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
very specific thing that's very case
 
03:19:59.670 --> 03:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
specific and I worry about the there is
 
03:20:02.670 --> 03:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
a question I worry about the two
 
03:20:04.349 --> 03:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
branches here we are the legislative and
 
03:20:07.150 --> 03:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
they're the judicial and they are in the
 
03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
trenches covering each one of these
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
cases has it been thought to bring this
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
to to the judicial branch to maybe do
 
03:20:15.070 --> 03:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
what other states do and have it's kind
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
of like a when you're a student teacher
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
or something they have somebody sit in
 
03:20:20.910 --> 03:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
and observe the judges to see what's
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
going on and it's a surprise so it's
 
03:20:24.429 --> 03:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
kind of like an audit they don't know
 
03:20:26.670 --> 03:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
but that actually examines what each
 
03:20:28.070 --> 03:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
judge is doing to help with that
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight versus the
 
03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislature trying to get involved in
 
03:20:33.790 --> 03:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and telling them how
 
03:20:36.990 --> 03:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
to mitigate very sensitive situations
 
03:20:39.229 --> 03:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you for that idea that is
 
03:20:41.469 --> 03:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
also another interesting approach I do
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
have to say that just because you want
 
03:20:44.389 --> 03:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
to have something happen in public
 
03:20:45.389 --> 03:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it's always
 
03:20:48.070 --> 03:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable um TSA when I've had to be
 
03:20:50.309 --> 03:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
searched and even um in areas that I
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't go into another
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
location even if it might expose a
 
03:20:55.510 --> 03:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more of me than I would like
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
I would rather have that done in public
 
03:21:00.389 --> 03:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
just because sometimes it feels better
 
03:21:02.269 --> 03:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there are other eyes
 
03:21:04.510 --> 03:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
observing what's happening we're all
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
working the best that we can in order to
 
03:21:09.229 --> 03:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
do to implement the laws and and pass
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
the laws that are most protective of
 
03:21:13.710 --> 03:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
everybody who's involved however we also
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that that that bance
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
That Power Balance as well is not
 
03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
leading to a point where families are
 
03:21:23.070 --> 03:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
being are losing their children when
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't and also that if when
 
03:21:27.309 --> 03:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
people are able to see those power
 
03:21:29.429 --> 03:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
balances when somebody is enabling
 
03:21:31.229 --> 03:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
enabling this sort of abuse I think that
 
03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
people try understanding that you know M
 
03:21:35.469 --> 03:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
Mrs Jones actually was doing the wrong
 
03:21:38.590 --> 03:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
thing Mrs Jones was having it so that
 
03:21:40.990 --> 03:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
her child was being subjected to harm
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
and by Mrs Jones not standing up to that
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
that is truly harm while in somebody may
 
03:21:48.870 --> 03:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
not intend to make themselves an example
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
of what not to do that's what happens
 
03:21:52.670 --> 03:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
when you choose to have something done
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
publicly and when people are able to see
 
03:21:57.070 --> 03:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
it it's a lot easier to say no that's
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
not you may think that this was wrong
 
03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
but in fact what you're doing is
 
03:22:03.630 --> 03:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
something that is not acceptable to
 
03:22:05.550 --> 03:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire it's not a
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable way of raising your children
 
03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we all see as
 
03:22:11.070 --> 03:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
abuse and once you get to the point
 
03:22:12.590 --> 03:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
where that can be broadcast and that can
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
be shared then you get past the question
 
03:22:17.550 --> 03:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
of well do I trust this person do I
 
03:22:19.710 --> 03:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
trust what they're saying because so
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
much of this dispute comes down to who
 
03:22:21.720 --> 03:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
much of this dispute comes down to who
we

03:22:22.710 --> 03:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
trust followup representative Greg thank
 
03:22:27.389 --> 03:22:27.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman would you believe that
 
03:22:30.750 --> 03:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
I've sat in on many many court cases um
 
03:22:33.030 --> 03:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
and watched the high the high level of
 
03:22:35.950 --> 03:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
emotion and watch people say things or
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
do things that they wouldn't normally do
 
03:22:39.150 --> 03:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
in public that had that been broadcasted
 
03:22:41.150 --> 03:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
they would probably struggle to then
 
03:22:44.990 --> 03:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
find a job or anything else
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
after well that was would you believe
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
right um that was a what you believe yes
 
03:22:52.110 --> 03:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
but I also do know that there's people
 
03:22:53.870 --> 03:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
who massively struggle with having their
 
03:22:55.790 --> 03:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
children taken when there's not a good
 
03:22:57.830 --> 03:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
reason for it and you and I sat through
 
03:23:01.150 --> 03:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
sat in the subcommittee on uh DCF and we
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
did hear very emotional testimony um
 
03:23:06.030 --> 03:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
some that I I also saw was getting into
 
03:23:08.670 --> 03:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
that emotional area but the question is
 
03:23:11.950 --> 03:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
if people want to have views into what
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
is happening and why their child is
 
03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
being removed I think that that is
 
03:23:15.560 --> 03:23:18.030 align:start position:0%
being removed I think that that is
reasonable

03:23:18.030 --> 03:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:23:21.150 --> 03:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Raymond uh
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Madam chair uh Vice
 
03:23:24.670 --> 03:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you for taking my
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
question um my question is about the
 
03:23:29.790 --> 03:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
rights of the child um to privacy I'm
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
thinking about the hundreds of cases in
 
03:23:34.630 --> 03:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
the family court that I've sat in where
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic records where medical
 
03:23:39.990 --> 03:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
records and where evidence of things
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
like sexual abuse um have been discussed
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom and my question is who
 
03:23:50.189 --> 03:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
gets to decide where the child's right
 
03:23:53.710 --> 03:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
to privacy is um and if the parents
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
disagree on whether or not they think
 
03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea for their minor child's
 
03:24:01.469 --> 03:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
information to go out who where's the
 
03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
protection for like the best interest
 
03:24:05.590 --> 03:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
part of this this bill because I'm
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
seeing preponderance of the evidence
 
03:24:09.150 --> 03:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
that it would hurt them but where's the
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
best interest that is usually guides
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
most of our stuff well thank you for the
 
03:24:16.710 --> 03:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
question um I I would support giving a
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
veto of that child of saying that I
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't want any of this broadcast but if
 
03:24:23.229 --> 03:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
the child is sitting there saying why am
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
I not able to see my dad why was why was
 
03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
I removed from the home why is this
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
happening because my dad hasn't done
 
03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
anything to hurt me and they don't
 
03:24:34.510 --> 03:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
understand why it's happened that that
 
03:24:37.030 --> 03:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
child should be able to say no I may
 
03:24:39.070 --> 03:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
only be seven but I know that my dad
 
03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything wrong and I want this
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
to be broadcast to make sure I can get
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
back with him know if you give it to a
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
veto power of the child then we get into
 
03:24:50.189 --> 03:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
a situation where at least in some of
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
these some of these cases uh we can be
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
in a situation where we're not
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
separating these families honestly I
 
03:24:58.429 --> 03:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
think that I I think that I think that
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
that might make sense because I do agree
 
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
that you don't want to have your dirty
 
03:25:04.510 --> 03:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
laundry tossed out in public unless
 
03:25:06.349 --> 03:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
there is a very very strong reason to do
 
03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
so but I do I have spoken with people
 
03:25:12.389 --> 03:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
where it does seem very clear that there
 
03:25:14.830 --> 03:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
was a violation and if there was if they
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
had been able to have a recording and
 
03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
and have that information I think that
 
03:25:20.469 --> 03:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
everybody would see how clear it was or
 
03:25:21.750 --> 03:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
I would know that the wool's been pulled
 
03:25:24.670 --> 03:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
over my eyes but either way somebody who
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that public we would
 
03:25:28.910 --> 03:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
understand what was happening thank you
 
03:25:30.389 --> 03:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh representative rice and then
 
03:25:32.429 --> 03:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you madam
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking another
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
question so in section four of the bill
 
03:25:39.469 --> 03:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
it states copies of video and audio
 
03:25:41.429 --> 03:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
recording shall be made available by the
 
03:25:45.550 --> 03:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
clerk's office blah blah blah um so
 
03:25:49.990 --> 03:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
anybody just go in and grab the video of
 
03:25:53.189 --> 03:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
the private and personal hearing that
 
03:25:55.710 --> 03:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
was just held that may not have anything
 
03:25:58.950 --> 03:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
to do with the the family cuz there's no
 
03:26:00.910 --> 03:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
limitations here uh thank you for
 
03:26:02.269 --> 03:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
bringing that up that would be a good
 
03:26:04.269 --> 03:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
limitation to add so I appreciate you
 
03:26:06.110 --> 03:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
helping make it better thank
 
03:26:08.710 --> 03:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you madam Vice chair and
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:26:15.349 --> 03:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
question are there other states who are
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh where this is um in practice um thank
 
03:26:20.550 --> 03:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
you for the question I don't know and
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%

03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for coming here today
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
um so divorce proceedings family court
 
03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
contentious in situations where the two
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
parties don't
 
03:26:46.990 --> 03:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
agree what would occur
 
03:26:48.750 --> 03:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
um if you look at this it says that if
 
03:26:50.750 --> 03:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
one party asked to have that then the
 
03:26:52.030 --> 03:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
judge would need to say that there's a
 
03:26:52.040 --> 03:26:55.469 align:start position:0%
judge would need to say that there's a
reparable

03:26:55.469 --> 03:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
harm they would need to prove right so
 
03:27:01.229 --> 03:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
it would be another they would first
 
03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
need to prove it and then the judge
 
03:27:06.550 --> 03:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
would order it thank you yes I I can
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
read that that's what's in here and I do
 
03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
know that there is an amendment that is
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
coming so since there is an idea of an
 
03:27:13.710 --> 03:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
amendment assuming that it's it sounds
 
03:27:15.429 --> 03:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
that it that the amendment was supported
 
03:27:16.910 --> 03:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
by the prime sponsor
 
03:27:18.750 --> 03:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
so if the prime SP sponsor has an
 
03:27:21.590 --> 03:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendment um then I think that it's
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
helpful to highlight some of the issues
 
03:27:25.750 --> 03:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
and challenges with this language so
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
that she can incorporate this into her
 
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment but um and I thank you for
 
03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:33.150 align:start position:0%
Amendment but um and I thank you for
highlighting

03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
highlighting
 
03:27:37.389 --> 03:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
that look forward to the amendment
 
03:27:40.349 --> 03:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
thanks representative love thank you
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
question uh you me mentioned that the
 
03:27:46.469 --> 03:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
probation officer had gone to court and
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
testified and somehow that testimony
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
came up missing um would you and you
 
03:27:53.189 --> 03:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of opposition to the
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
the privacy of of people here uh would
 
03:27:58.670 --> 03:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
the the sponsors be amendable to uh
 
03:28:01.309 --> 03:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
amending this to just uh it it shall be
 
03:28:03.150 --> 03:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
recorded and those recordings are
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
available to the the
 
03:28:08.030 --> 03:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
parties um thank you that is an
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
interesting idea where then if that is
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
available and it can be referenced um
 
03:28:14.429 --> 03:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
that that that may be one way to address
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
03:28:26.349 --> 03:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
marel thank you for taking my call um
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
question sorry uh nobody's perfect
 
03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
um out of curiosity um you're aware that
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
audio recordings are made of these
 
03:28:41.269 --> 03:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
proceedings as they go correct I'm
 
03:28:43.590 --> 03:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
correct I am aware that we did pass that
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
um the part of the question I think I am
 
03:28:48.030 --> 03:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
aware that we have passed that my
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
um that there's also been issues with
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
the audio recording seeming like they've
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
been cut off from time to time I've
 
03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
heard that before I I I'm more giving
 
03:29:01.990 --> 03:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
that general information of it because
 
03:29:03.710 --> 03:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's if you have a video recording it's
 
03:29:06.229 --> 03:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
a lot easier to see the Stutter Step if
 
03:29:08.229 --> 03:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
the video goes out as opposed to an
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
audio recording going out okay follow-up
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
question followup thank you um because
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
you can order uh in my experience also
 
03:29:20.070 --> 03:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
ordering them for appeals is is that
 
03:29:21.630 --> 03:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
when you contact in New Hampshire you
 
03:29:24.429 --> 03:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
contact escribers and you can order an
 
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
audio uh recording of it and you can
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
also uh also get a written transcript of
 
03:29:33.150 --> 03:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
the proceedings um I guess what I'm
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand if there's going to be a
 
03:29:38.510 --> 03:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
break in the audio there'll be a break
 
03:29:40.590 --> 03:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the transcript as well
 
03:29:42.910 --> 03:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there uh correct and that is
 
03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually one of the issues that having a
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
video recording where you you can see if
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
suddenly it goes from me speaking here
 
03:29:51.229 --> 03:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
and then it starts again with me sitting
 
03:29:53.790 --> 03:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
in the other chair next to it it's clear
 
03:29:56.750 --> 03:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
that is not a continuous recording in an
 
03:29:58.630 --> 03:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
audio recording that's not the case I'm
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
talking thank you that actually I I was
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
about to say that I'm talking about when
 
03:30:12.590 --> 03:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's technical problems and nobody is
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
intended to cut off when nobody is
 
03:30:18.030 --> 03:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
intended to cut off the recording but it
 
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
happens from time to time because we're
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
all human and worse we use computers and
 
03:30:25.309 --> 03:30:25.319 align:start position:0%
those they don't always like us so
 
03:30:27.189 --> 03:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's unavoidable reasons
 
03:30:29.550 --> 03:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
why there is a break in the continuity
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't mean that somebody's
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
doing something wrong it just means that
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
continuity okay thank you representative
 
03:30:41.070 --> 03:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
rice thank you madam shair thank you
 
03:30:43.830 --> 03:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
again so my next question is going to be
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
what prevents someone from getting these
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
recordings with the children in the
 
03:30:50.030 --> 03:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
thing and then they're posted to social
 
03:30:52.349 --> 03:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
media and all that is there going to be
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
limitations as to what they can do with
 
03:30:54.319 --> 03:30:55.189 align:start position:0%
limitations as to what they can do with
these

03:30:55.189 --> 03:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:30:56.990 --> 03:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
recordings well thank you for the
 
03:30:59.070 --> 03:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
question I think that that is a very
 
03:31:00.189 --> 03:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
to it's a matter of putting the
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
guardrails around that so nobody was
 
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to even speak about their case
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
in dcyf until recently because there was
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
a gag order on on some of what was
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
happening um so we do have some of those
 
03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
issues around that transparency and I
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
know we're all working together to
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
better better improve the lives of both
 
03:31:21.070 --> 03:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
Children and Families but then there are
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
some hurdles along the way I don't think
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
that this should be shared maliciously
 
03:31:28.030 --> 03:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
on social media but I also think that if
 
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
you have video that your parole officer
 
03:31:32.070 --> 03:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
saw your child 5 minutes after you
 
03:31:34.030 --> 03:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
supposedly punched them in the face and
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
the parole officer says no I visited
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
them and they were fine and they were
 
03:31:40.469 --> 03:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
watching a movie at the time and nothing
 
03:31:42.630 --> 03:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
was wrong and if you still have your
 
03:31:46.269 --> 03:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
trial taken based on testimony that's
 
03:31:48.670 --> 03:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's put against um that that has a
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
parole officer testifying on your behalf
 
03:31:52.510 --> 03:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
at a certain point shouldn't you be
 
03:31:55.189 --> 03:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to share that on social media um
 
03:31:56.710 --> 03:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
I would hope that we aren't having
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
things like that happening I'm I'm kind
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
of hoping for the recordings so that I
 
03:32:02.189 --> 03:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
can know if somebody is selling me a
 
03:32:04.630 --> 03:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
bill of goods but if this is actually
 
03:32:07.269 --> 03:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
happening that's a huge problem it's a
 
03:32:09.189 --> 03:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
huge silent problem and it's something
 
03:32:10.510 --> 03:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
that we can address through greater
 
03:32:12.429 --> 03:32:12.439 align:start position:0%
transparency and I appreciate all the
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
work you've done trying to keep Kids
 
03:32:18.469 --> 03:32:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.389 --> 03:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%

I have prepared written testimony I

apologize that I did have some issues
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
with the copy machine so there's blank
 
03:33:25.070 --> 03:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
pages interspersed throughout whereas I
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
was trying to double space a double page
 
03:33:30.469 --> 03:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
so I completely muffed it up and so
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
forgive me for that um but um you'll see
 
03:33:35.189 --> 03:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
that there are really three main reasons
 
03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
why we would oppose this um one we
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
believe it will harm children um who are
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
already negatively impacted when parents
 
03:33:45.550 --> 03:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
are separating and I'll point out that
 
03:33:46.990 --> 03:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
um we just heard a lot of testimony
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
about dcyf proceedings when I read this
 
03:33:51.870 --> 03:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
um hadn't even occurred to me that that
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
was an intentioned was to um broadcast
 
03:33:57.870 --> 03:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
live confidential DCF abuse and neglect
 
03:34:00.389 --> 03:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
or parent ter termination of parental
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
rights from parental rights cases which
 
03:34:06.870 --> 03:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
are already confidential cases under
 
03:34:09.550 --> 03:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
statute and this specifically excludes
 
03:34:13.950 --> 03:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
confidential cases from being um
 
03:34:17.389 --> 03:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
broadcast um if this work enacted so it
 
03:34:21.710 --> 03:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
it would not even uh fix the situation
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
that we just heard about because those
 
03:34:27.309 --> 03:34:27.319 align:start position:0%
would be excluded entirely so I read
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
this to apply to divorce parenting and
 
03:34:32.590 --> 03:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
protection order cases in the Family
 
03:34:36.349 --> 03:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
Court um and when I see that I do see
 
03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
that one party could decide to request
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
to have it live streamed there's no
 
03:34:44.910 --> 03:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
guard rails whatsoever on that um and
 
03:34:46.189 --> 03:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:34:48.269 --> 03:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
limitation that's placed on that where
 
03:34:49.950 --> 03:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
by a preponderance of the evidence the
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
other party who doesn't want it live
 
03:34:54.110 --> 03:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
streamed um would have to demonstrate
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm to them or a witness um
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
and then the court would need to decide
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
which portion of the case would not be
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
broadcast so this would be broadcast
 
03:35:08.110 --> 03:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
live streamed anybody could download
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
that broadcast there's no it's going to
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
be there really forever right it's out
 
03:35:16.269 --> 03:35:16.279 align:start position:0%
there on the internet there's no
 
03:35:20.469 --> 03:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
hauling it back um I also think even if
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
the court W didn't Grant the request to
 
03:35:25.229 --> 03:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
live stream when we have the video
 
03:35:27.510 --> 03:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
recordings it just makes it that much
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
more easy for someone to go request that
 
03:35:33.229 --> 03:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
video recording and then take pieces of
 
03:35:36.950 --> 03:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
that videotape and post selective cuts
 
03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
um on Tik Tok or uh Facebook or
 
03:35:42.990 --> 03:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
Instagram or you name it whatever you
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
know uh YouTube um social media that you
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
can think of and it's gone it's there
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's out there um I do think that that
 
03:35:56.349 --> 03:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
is a major concern especially for kids
 
03:36:00.990 --> 03:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh because they they are already by the
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
policy of the family court um trying the
 
03:36:06.510 --> 03:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
court is trying to set a stage when
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
parents are separating to protect
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
children the first thing that families
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
do is go to a first appearance and you
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
probably all know about this um but this
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
is the opportunity where the parents
 
03:36:20.189 --> 03:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
come hear from the judge about how to
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
behave in the best interest of their
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
children to try to work towards
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
co-parenting every single parent has to
 
03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
go to a child impact seminar that
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
seminar is um uh I think it's like 3
 
03:36:34.469 --> 03:36:34.479 align:start position:0%
hours that they sit and they learn all
 
03:36:37.670 --> 03:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
about how to be um thinking about their
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
children's best interests as they
 
03:36:43.429 --> 03:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
separate to try to calm things down um
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
children should be protected from what
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
happens in the courtroom children will
 
03:36:49.870 --> 03:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
not be protected from what happens in
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
the courtroom if this bill passes um one
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
minute and then the last thing is I
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
think that for domestic violence
 
03:37:02.070 --> 03:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
survivors this will be a barrier to
 
03:37:04.030 --> 03:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to file protection orders
 
03:37:06.429 --> 03:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
because they will be concerned that this
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
could be live streamed this will be a
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
threat that could be held over their
 
03:37:13.469 --> 03:37:13.479 align:start position:0%
head to not go seek the help that they
 
03:37:17.950 --> 03:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
need um there's several ways that a an
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
abuser could coer a victim If This Were
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
enacted so I just want to reiterate that
 
03:37:25.870 --> 03:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
we're asking this to be itl I can't
 
03:37:27.349 --> 03:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
believe that the court would want to
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
Pilot this honestly I don't think that's
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we would support
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
either thank you thank you Miss Krueger
 
03:37:34.840 --> 03:37:38.670 align:start position:0%
either thank you thank you Miss Krueger
any

03:37:38.670 --> 03:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.990 --> 03:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you I'll call forward uh
 
03:37:58.269 --> 03:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon good afternoon
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and members of the committee

uh I have three exhibits that are being
passed

03:38:10.590 --> 03:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
around uh the
 
03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
first uh is an email from from
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
escribers uh regarding the preparation
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
of a court
 
03:38:23.070 --> 03:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
transcript uh where they're going to
 
03:38:25.590 --> 03:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
deliberately leave out uh judicial
 
03:38:27.990 --> 03:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct and escribers tells the
 
03:38:30.429 --> 03:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
judicial branch quote of course we are
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
not going to transcribe that however the
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
ordering party has also ordered the
 
03:38:41.229 --> 03:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
audio uh second is an email from uh
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
former chief administrative Circuit
 
03:38:47.030 --> 03:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
Court Judge David King uh indicating
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
he's fully aware of that and
 
03:38:53.309 --> 03:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
third is
 
03:39:00.269 --> 03:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
the uh August 26 2022 partial deposition
 
03:39:03.309 --> 03:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
of Judge David King uh where he's under
 
03:39:08.750 --> 03:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
oath and uh being asked uh about the
 
03:39:12.670 --> 03:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
transcript and uh these are all widely
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
available online for anyone watching
 
03:39:17.349 --> 03:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
just uh go to judg king.com or Google
 
03:39:20.349 --> 03:39:20.359 align:start position:0%
judg King uh
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
deposition uh so uh with that said as to
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
the need for the
 
03:39:30.990 --> 03:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh I would sort of repeat most of
 
03:39:34.030 --> 03:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
what rep Lon said uh but you already
 
03:39:37.550 --> 03:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
heard it from her so I don't have to uh
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
so let me drill down on the specific
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
need here and some of Eternal
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
Mars sir how do I your your name forgive
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
me Markel
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
comments uh on the accuracy of the
 
03:39:54.840 --> 03:39:56.630 align:start position:0%
comments uh on the accuracy of the
record

03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
record
 
03:40:03.830 --> 03:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
um what's very problematic here is when
 
03:40:07.389 --> 03:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.399 --> 03:40:09.429 align:start position:0%
 
simply

03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
simply
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
creating an inaccurate record
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
deliberately to cover up judicial
 
03:40:16.110 --> 03:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
misconduct deliberately
 
03:40:20.830 --> 03:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
and if you look at uh page 26 uh this
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
transcript is redacted uh the deposition
 
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
is redacted I've been unable to get the
 
03:40:29.309 --> 03:40:29.319 align:start position:0%
whole thing um if you look at what's
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be page 26 lines 12 to 16 uh
 
03:40:35.950 --> 03:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
you'll note Five Points number one judge
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
king was under oath during the
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
deposition number two it appears that
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
judge king knowingly lied by stating
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
that he informed the judicial conduct
 
03:40:46.510 --> 03:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
committee about his findings regarding
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
the transcript when in fact he did no
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
such thing uh point three uh it appears
 
03:40:55.630 --> 03:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
he intentionally did not disclose his
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
findings to the judicial conduct
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee fully aware that his
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
deposition statement was false uh number
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
four you have about one minute yes very
 
03:41:08.070 --> 03:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
material thank you cost signant delays
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
lasting several years which necessitated
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court's orders
 
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
for multiple revisions of the initially
 
03:41:19.229 --> 03:41:19.239 align:start position:0%
falsified transcript and uh point five
 
03:41:20.910 --> 03:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh he made this false statement in a
 
03:41:22.710 --> 03:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
legal context where he wasn't under an
 
03:41:25.349 --> 03:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
obligation to tell the truth and so
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
that's just uh
 
03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:30.590 align:start position:0%
that's just uh
to

03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
to

of a domestic violence
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
victim uh because the perpetrator uh

standard channels that exist today to do
 
03:42:05.229 --> 03:42:05.239 align:start position:0%

03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
highly irregular that was last on uh
 
03:42:08.120 --> 03:42:09.349 align:start position:0%

gay you may proceed thank you madam
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
chair this is not one of those fun bills
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
where everybody says oh thank goodness
 
03:43:56.710 --> 03:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
we finally have this I've been meaning
 
03:44:00.149 --> 03:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
to do it I have submitted this bill in
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
another form twice because we found out
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
that if there's a breakdown in
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
communication deliberately between
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
people who are in family court and
 
03:44:17.790 --> 03:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
supposedly it is for protection privacy
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
protection but that means that people
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
don't get to know each other's troubles
 
03:44:25.710 --> 03:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
that are happening in court and it
 
03:44:27.990 --> 03:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
became apparent to me as a rep when I
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
was appealed to by victims of bad
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
practices in court when they would look
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
forward to getting their excuse me their
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
recordings that they paid for all all
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
transcript you can buy the recordings
 
03:44:46.510 --> 03:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
and they're very affordable like $35
 
03:44:48.510 --> 03:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
paying for a transcript you're talking
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
into thousands so lots of people are
 
03:44:53.070 --> 03:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
priced right out of the market they
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
can't and they're not legally permitted
 
03:44:56.590 --> 03:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
to make their own
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
transcripts which I think is very
 
03:45:03.630 --> 03:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
unfair um so one of the problems is they
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
would look forward to getting their
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
their their recordings because the judge
 
03:45:11.630 --> 03:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
said something that they absolutely
 
03:45:15.229 --> 03:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
should not have said and then they find
 
03:45:17.710 --> 03:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
out it's been
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
deleted so if one person said that to me
 
03:45:23.269 --> 03:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be a little suspicious no
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
several people have told me that so
 
03:45:27.790 --> 03:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a friendly
 
03:45:31.070 --> 03:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
discussion on policy to change Family
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
Court plenty of people who are employed
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
by the court do not like the changes so
 
03:45:40.149 --> 03:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
we are in a hostile environment to come
 
03:45:42.269 --> 03:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
in and say we need some changes here to
 
03:45:46.830 --> 03:45:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:46.840 --> 03:45:48.429 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:45:48.429 --> 03:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:51.910 --> 03:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
historically recordings are edited and
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
as the man who just testified he has
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
written proof an email from transcribers
 
03:46:03.070 --> 03:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
where they say very openly well we clean
 
03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
up I'm using my own terms we clean up
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
what the judge says if they think it's
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
not worthy of a judge they'll make it
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
nicer so we finally had a person who
 
03:46:20.189 --> 03:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
could watch the judge so they had the
 
03:46:23.550 --> 03:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
transcribers cleaning up the language we
 
03:46:27.790 --> 03:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
also have a person who was watching that
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
just happened the judge wasn't behind a
 
03:46:33.710 --> 03:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
solid a solid uh you know you could see
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
their feet she could see him turning it
 
03:46:40.469 --> 03:46:40.479 align:start position:0%
off and on and that would explain why
 
03:46:43.070 --> 03:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
there were Clicks in the recording when
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
he was saying something like you're not
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to like this or something else
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
that wasn't really polite he turned the
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
recording off this has to stop and if
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
people can make their own recordings I
 
03:47:01.469 --> 03:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
don't for me I don't have to have it uh
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
paid paid played out to the world I just
 
03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
want people to have the right to make
 
03:47:06.479 --> 03:47:07.309 align:start position:0%
want people to have the right to make
the

03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:10.590 --> 03:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
recordings and then they can still buy
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the recording that's still the official
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
but if their recording does match the
 
03:47:18.349 --> 03:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
official recording I think we'll see a
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
change in the behavior of the people
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
processing the recordings because there
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
should be P punishment or lose the
 
03:47:27.750 --> 03:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
contract if you're going to do
 
03:47:30.670 --> 03:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
that so I think if a crime against a
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
child 30 seconds if a crime against a
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
child is being
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
discussed Family Court probably isn't
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
the right place it probably should be in
 
03:47:42.950 --> 03:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
criminal court so I think for to protect
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
the child the truth has to come out and
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
the recording is a necessary part of the
 
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
truth coming
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
out thank you thank you any questions
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:59.070 --> 03:47:59.080 align:start position:0%

03:48:30.910 --> 03:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time Mr robat you've
 
03:48:33.309 --> 03:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
asked for 3 to five minutes how about if

the risk of misunderstandings and
 
03:49:38.070 --> 03:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations for litigants it
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
creates an official and transparent
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
record that is crucial in the event of
 
03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
an appeal ensuring fairness in the
 
03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
judicial process for court officials
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
recordings provide an efficient way to
 
03:49:52.550 --> 03:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
review and pro proceedings without the
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
need for extensive transcripts
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
ultimately reducing costs this method
 
03:49:59.469 --> 03:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
also promotes accountability consistency
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
and Family Court decisions audio video
 
03:50:03.830 --> 03:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
recordings protect all parties to the
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
case it protects the courts and the
 
03:50:08.750 --> 03:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
litigants um and I just want to point
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
out there was questions about other
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
states doing this Nevada are audio video
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
recorded in every County
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
and um you fill out a form you request
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the thing the recording on a CD or a
 
03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
memory stick so they also are recorded
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
in Kentucky so I don't know you may want
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
to somebody look into that and see or
 
03:50:32.149 --> 03:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to email me some
 
03:50:34.910 --> 03:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
information on it so I'm happy to take
 
03:50:39.309 --> 03:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880 align:start position:0%

card it's from Aon KGAN who has made

questions does anybody have any
 
03:51:27.070 --> 03:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:29.269 --> 03:51:29.279 align:start position:0%
KGAN sorry just introducing myself for
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
the folks at home general counsel for
 
03:51:32.590 --> 03:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
the court system I was just going to ask
 
03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
you to do that thank you for introducing
 
03:51:39.630 --> 03:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative McMahon
 
03:51:44.149 --> 03:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question do we need this
 
03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
bill as a member of the judicial branch
 
03:51:51.510 --> 03:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
I would always defer to the legislature
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
on whether to uh pursue a bill or not I
 
03:51:58.349 --> 03:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
would not want to advise you um I do
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
understand and I think you hear it there
 
03:52:02.189 --> 03:52:02.199 align:start position:0%
are different interests there's
 
03:52:03.750 --> 03:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
transparency and then there's privacy
 
03:52:05.429 --> 03:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
and those can come into pretty direct
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
conflict and those are those are very
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to balance so I don't envy you
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
uh the job that you have um there are
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
some options people have now uh they can
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
request to record or they can uh seek a
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
copy of the video surveillance the
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
security video surveillance which does
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
not have audio but it is a a form of
 
03:52:26.429 --> 03:52:26.439 align:start position:0%
video um I understand the purpose of
 
03:52:28.429 --> 03:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
this to be to to try to create more
 
03:52:30.189 --> 03:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
transparency as the court system we want
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
people to have confidence in the work
 
03:52:34.510 --> 03:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
that the courts do um but we also want
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
people to feel safe and secure in Family
 
03:52:38.590 --> 03:52:38.600 align:start position:0%
Division and feel that they can discuss
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
some matters that are very very intimate
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and often very private uh that's a
 
03:52:44.550 --> 03:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
challenging balance I appreciate the
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
conversation that I've had with um some
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor of this legislation to
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
make some changes including potentially
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
not being live potentially being
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
recorded rather than live so that things
 
03:52:56.110 --> 03:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
could be redacted if they needed to be
 
03:52:59.830 --> 03:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
um starting with one courthouse uh as a
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
as a scaling measure to see how it were
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
to go um and I think also considering
 
03:53:06.189 --> 03:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
more judicial discretion was something
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
that the the sponsors were thinking of
 
03:53:09.309 --> 03:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
as well to to deal with individual
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances so it's it's been a very
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
good dialogue but I would I would not
 
03:53:14.670 --> 03:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
want to comment on whether the legisl
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
determination should be whether to move
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
forward with the bill or not one one
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:26.590 --> 03:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
you relative to the Genesis of why the
 
03:53:29.429 --> 03:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
bill is here can you comment on are
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
Judges selectively revising the records
 
03:53:34.750 --> 03:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
after the fact I have no information
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that I do know that there is
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
an instance where a judge under their
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
breath said an exploitive and the
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
describers did not know whether to
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
transcribe an exploitive or or not the
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
person was fired um as a result of that
 
03:53:50.229 --> 03:53:50.239 align:start position:0%
incident thank you very much thank you
 
03:53:50.239 --> 03:53:51.389 align:start position:0%
incident thank you very much thank you
madam

03:53:51.389 --> 03:53:51.399 align:start position:0%
madam
 
03:53:56.110 --> 03:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh representative Greg
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:53:59.429 --> 03:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
being here taking my question so I just
 
03:54:02.389 --> 03:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if is there any kind of a
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
judicial review or anything if a judge
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
Cuts an entire section out or is there
 
03:54:10.189 --> 03:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
any um a check and balance on that kind
 
03:54:13.309 --> 03:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
of stuff it it's a great question in um
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
in our Superior Courts if you've
 
03:54:15.790 --> 03:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
traveled to them you may know that there
 
03:54:17.590 --> 03:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
are Court monitors who are listening the
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
entire time and they're very careful and
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're checking the records our circuit
 
03:54:23.189 --> 03:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
courts are just not staffed that way um
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
typically it is just the judge and a
 
03:54:26.710 --> 03:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
court security officer in the courtroom
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
and the court security officer in
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
addition to scanning for potential
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
security issues flicks on the record
 
03:54:33.189 --> 03:54:33.199 align:start position:0%
when they see the judge come back to the
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
bench and flicks it off as the judge is
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
leaving I don't think it's impossible
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
that someone's made an error I don't
 
03:54:39.149 --> 03:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
have a reason to think it's something
 
03:54:40.630 --> 03:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
other than an error but typically when
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
the judge is not present the record is
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
not on and people in the courtroom are
 
03:54:44.910 --> 03:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
speaking freely without being worried
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
recorded representative
 
03:54:56.710 --> 03:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
love thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you know in
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
talking to constituents of mine uh the
 
03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
the family courts are the the confidence
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
in is at an all-time low uh we need
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
transparency would the would the
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
judicial system be uh adverse to to
 
03:55:14.309 --> 03:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
doing like I asked um repres
 
03:55:16.590 --> 03:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon to to to streamline
 
03:55:19.309 --> 03:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
this to uh to just the people can get
 
03:55:21.950 --> 03:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
the the litigants can get copies of the
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
of the proceedings so if they have to go
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
on and and you know uh go to Superior
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
Court or whatever you uh they'll have it
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
at a at a reasonable cost you heard U
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
representative gay uh talk about
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
thousands for for um transcripts um you
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
know we've got to do better than that
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
especially with so many people are doing
 
03:55:41.630 --> 03:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
prosay and that's that's because they're
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
broke you're completely right that most
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
people who appear in the Family Court
 
03:55:47.309 --> 03:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
appear without a lawyer and that this is
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
a very intimidating process and often
 
03:55:50.590 --> 03:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
this is the worst thing that will ever
 
03:55:52.550 --> 03:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
happen to them they're getting divorced
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're the subject of an abuse and
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
neglect case they have to seek a civil
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
protective order this is maybe the worst
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
day of their lives um and they're coming
 
03:56:02.189 --> 03:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
without a lawyer to a court system
 
03:56:05.030 --> 03:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's a very intimidating process um
 
03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
completely want people to have
 
03:56:09.630 --> 03:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
confidence so we want to be partners in
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
in the measures that legislators are
 
03:56:15.790 --> 03:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
taking to increase that confidence um
 
03:56:18.269 --> 03:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
people can record if that may be an
 
03:56:19.830 --> 03:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
option for
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
them I think I would just need more
 
03:56:24.070 --> 03:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
legislative guidance on whether This
 
03:56:26.429 --> 03:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
subsumes Confidential hearings and how
 
03:56:28.590 --> 03:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
that would be protected or whether this
 
03:56:30.830 --> 03:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
is only not confidential proceedings
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
whether the court is allowed to order
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
that they not disseminate it or whether
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
they can't order that because the
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has made a determination
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
that it is a it is something that can be
 
03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
distributed so I think that there are
 
03:56:42.389 --> 03:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
things we can do to instill more
 
03:56:43.830 --> 03:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
confidence but I would still expect that
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
the record is turned off when the court
 
03:56:47.870 --> 03:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
is not sitting so it may be that you
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
experience some of these same concerns
 
03:56:51.070 --> 03:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
that folks have that the record is off
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
for a period of time um what I might
 
03:56:54.670 --> 03:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
suggest to someone if they are worried
 
03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
about that is to get the security video
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
and see that it'll run through because
 
03:57:01.429 --> 03:57:01.439 align:start position:0%
it has no audio and they'll be able to
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
see the full run through period which is
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
now followup yes ma'am um what would a a
 
03:57:15.630 --> 03:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
recording without any a do for anybody
 
03:57:16.990 --> 03:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
it would show you if you match it with
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
the audio which you can also order you
 
03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
can see what what periods of time are
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
not recorded So when that the judge is
 
03:57:24.750 --> 03:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
Off the Bench that there's not a witness
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
speaking and I know that that's labor
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
intensive but there there's at least
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
some potential check there um but your
 
03:57:32.309 --> 03:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
point about transcripts and the costs I
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
mean you're right they can be expensive
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh this being New Hampshire uh we
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
completely outsourced the transcript
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
process to a private company which does
 
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
them at order as people order them they
 
03:57:44.910 --> 03:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
pay for them it is not a service we do
 
03:57:46.349 --> 03:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
in house so it's not a situation where
 
03:57:47.710 --> 03:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
we have the transcript and we're not
 
03:57:49.510 --> 03:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
giving it to someone we don't have it
 
03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's a private company that's making it
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
it any further
 
03:58:01.750 --> 03:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
day with that I will close the hearing
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
um on House Bill 350 FN
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
and I will open the hearing on House
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%

03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
time and ask all those here to testify
 
03:58:31.469 --> 03:58:31.479 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 335 to uh
 
03:58:35.670 --> 03:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
forgive the uh lateness of opening this
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
hearing and the first person I'm going
 
03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
to call is the only pink card that I
 
03:58:42.910 --> 03:58:42.920 align:start position:0%

representative kein cab and I am
 
03:59:05.229 --> 03:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
introducing House Bill 335 on behalf of
 
03:59:07.870 --> 03:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor Lisa post who could
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
not be here
 
03:59:12.349 --> 03:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
today I have just passed around an
 
03:59:12.359 --> 03:59:15.070 align:start position:0%
today I have just passed around an
amendment

03:59:15.070 --> 03:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
from rep post which all of the
 
03:59:24.469 --> 03:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.590 --> 03:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
amendment the biggest thing that this
 
03:59:29.429 --> 03:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
amendment is seeking to change we have
 
03:59:32.309 --> 03:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
to speak on the bill not the amendment
 
03:59:34.149 --> 03:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just I'm going to reference the
 
03:59:36.830 --> 03:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
main bill as I as I talk it's one word
 
03:59:40.510 --> 03:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
change just so that we no so I'm sorry
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
ma'am no so um the
 
03:59:46.510 --> 03:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
when the main bill was written the
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
intent was that the
 
03:59:48.920 --> 03:59:51.710 align:start position:0%
intent was that the
court

03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
May um order a risk assessment within 14
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
days in certain
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances when um
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
worrying that there may be some sort of
 
04:00:10.349 --> 04:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
a family conflict or that the child may
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
be showing signs of abuse or rejecting
 
04:00:15.070 --> 04:00:15.080 align:start position:0%
that parent that they may be able to
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
order it unfortunately what had
 
04:00:18.830 --> 04:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
originally come out said shell and so
 
04:00:21.269 --> 04:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment changes it to May so when
 
04:00:21.279 --> 04:00:23.790 align:start position:0%
this amendment changes it to May so when
you're

04:00:23.790 --> 04:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:00:29.149 --> 04:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
looking on the original bill it is um on
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
line 8 that word shell is being changed
 
04:00:34.229 --> 04:00:34.239 align:start position:0%
to May by the
 
04:00:36.670 --> 04:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
amendment I do think that it's really
 
04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
important that
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
we're able to give this tool to the
 
04:00:43.389 --> 04:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
court it's enabling legislation it's not
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
requiring anything this is if the judge
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
feels like this is a necessary thing to
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
do that they're able to do this and I'm
 
04:00:54.110 --> 04:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions on this
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your testimony any
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:01:02.110 --> 04:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
representative um representative Raymond
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
and this will be on the bill only okay
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I think my thank you m uh M
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
chairwoman I think my question applies
 
04:01:12.670 --> 04:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh just fine for that so thank you for
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
about who will be doing these
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
assessments um is there an anticipated
 
04:01:24.670 --> 04:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
like court appointed pool of people to
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
the assessments um is it the can's
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
assessment that dcyf uses or is it up to
 
04:01:33.550 --> 04:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
the participants to identify their own
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
therapist and then have this assessment
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
done oh and is there a standard
 
04:01:41.790 --> 04:01:41.800 align:start position:0%
assessment that exists that would be
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
given or is it completely up to
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
individual providers that was a bunch of
 
04:01:46.399 --> 04:01:48.349 align:start position:0%
individual providers that was a bunch of
questions

04:01:48.349 --> 04:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for the questions
 
04:01:51.950 --> 04:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond so the bill is
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
specifying that it does have to be a
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
clinical psychologist who is
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
credentialed in this specific area um
 
04:02:01.950 --> 04:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
and so it would it would be somebody
 
04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
that would have to be credentialed in
 
04:02:06.030 --> 04:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
this in this specific area it wouldn't
 
04:02:09.550 --> 04:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.429 --> 04:02:12.439 align:start position:0%
court uh employee so to speak it would
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
it would be a it would be a private
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
provider um
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we're leaving it open to the judge
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
rather he rather they want to recommend
 
04:02:25.429 --> 04:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
a certain provider or the parties
 
04:02:27.389 --> 04:02:27.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps want to agree on a provider on
 
04:02:31.990 --> 04:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
their own um again this is a a May type
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
thing so I think it's really important
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
that we leave that leeway up because
 
04:02:39.030 --> 04:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps there is already a provider
 
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the family that the
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
child is really comfortable with and
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
would prefer to use rather than a
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
stranger that may be suggested that the
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
child doesn't know particularly if
 
04:02:52.149 --> 04:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
there's already some ongoing trauma of
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
some sort we wouldn't want to kind of
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
ret traumatize the child by having to go
 
04:03:00.229 --> 04:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
and talk to somebody different follow up
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
thank you followup uh thank you um so is
 
04:03:06.030 --> 04:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
there a definition for what is
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
assessment yes so that would be
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
starting at line
 
04:03:16.920 --> 04:03:20.590 align:start position:0%
starting at line
21

04:03:20.590 --> 04:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:24.389 --> 04:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all set well I'm just
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
wondering where the definition came
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
from like is this a is this a common
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
thing that's in like follow is that your
 
04:03:35.070 --> 04:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
followup yes that's my followup to
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
clarify the followup it is my
 
04:03:38.590 --> 04:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
understanding from the sponsor that this
 
04:03:41.070 --> 04:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
language she worked with a psychologist

borne by the
 
04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%

um uh
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh I have a daughter who's a clinical
 
04:04:50.269 --> 04:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
psychologist uh and I'm I'm aware
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
how uh how
 
04:04:55.950 --> 04:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
many how many different kinds of
 
04:04:58.590 --> 04:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
Specialties there are for clinical
 
04:05:02.309 --> 04:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
psychologist uh my concern is in a state
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire where there's not
 
04:05:08.830 --> 04:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
even as many clinical psychologists as
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
there are in Rhode Island where my
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
daughter works that we're creating in
 
04:05:17.910 --> 04:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
the mind of a court the possib the the
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
re the reality that boy I can have a
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
clinical psychologist help me make this
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
decision when in fact it's not the case
 
04:05:27.510 --> 04:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
do you know if the prime sponsor has any
 
04:05:29.790 --> 04:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
sense of whether there are there is a
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
large enough pool to make this
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
practical thank you for the question
 
04:05:35.590 --> 04:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative sure it is my
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that there while there are
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
not an overabundance of these providers
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are several of these providers
 
04:05:44.030 --> 04:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
within the state in different different
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
geographical areas of the state followup
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
just followup um what if one of the
 
04:05:54.630 --> 04:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
parties can't afford a clinical
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
psychologist what happens then thank you
 
04:05:59.469 --> 04:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
for the question so this is a this is a
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
May type of a thing so if the judge
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
deems that hey the parties can't afford
 
04:06:08.110 --> 04:06:08.120 align:start position:0%
it then in that case he wouldn't be
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
ordering it this is not I don't think
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're in a financial position right now
 
04:06:16.149 --> 04:06:16.159 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to bear the cost
 
04:06:16.159 --> 04:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to bear the cost
of

04:06:17.990 --> 04:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:06:18.000 --> 04:06:19.950 align:start position:0%
of
such

04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
such
 
04:06:22.990 --> 04:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation um on the court I think it
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
just it would have to be the parties
 
04:06:27.870 --> 04:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:30.590 --> 04:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:06:33.750 --> 04:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Madame Vice chair uh
 
04:06:35.550 --> 04:06:35.560 align:start position:0%
that question was asked and I appreciate
 
04:06:36.830 --> 04:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
it it was asked very nicely by
 
04:06:36.840 --> 04:06:38.309 align:start position:0%
it it was asked very nicely by
representative

04:06:38.309 --> 04:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:40.630 --> 04:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
Sher thank you representative Nelson
 
04:06:42.790 --> 04:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative rice did you remember
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it came back to me
 
04:06:45.040 --> 04:06:46.950 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it came back to me
yay

04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
yay
 
04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:55.510 --> 04:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
has had some therapy and all of that I
 
04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
know it's not readily available to get
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
in right away we do have a shortage are
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
you sure that because this is ordering
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
that it be done within 14 days of the
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
initial um petition for divorce and what
 
04:07:16.269 --> 04:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
would happen if that can't be done in 14
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
days because that's like two weeks like
 
04:07:22.910 --> 04:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
I can't get in to see my therapist that
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
click thank you for the question
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative race so this is requiring
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that it's ordered within 14 days of the
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
petition but it's not actually requiring
 
04:07:36.510 --> 04:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
that the assessment take place until on
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
page two lines three and four that it
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
shall be within a reasonable period of
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
time not to exceed 8 weeks after the
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative thank
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
you next I'll call Betty
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for allowing me to
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
talk about something that is dear to my
 
04:08:21.030 --> 04:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
heart all the questions that you're
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
asking are really good what you don't
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
realize is those questions could be used
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
for what is going on right now there are
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
several this is this again is to adjust
 
04:08:36.750 --> 04:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh address a really bad thing that's
 
04:08:38.670 --> 04:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
happening in some family
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
courts and that is that the judge is
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
ordering and I use we we need to talk
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
about Judges sometimes because that term
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
is not correct for most Family Court
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
judges it's a different term and it's a
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
different legal they're supposed to do
 
04:08:57.510 --> 04:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
that job but that's also a whole subject
 
04:09:00.670 --> 04:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
that the family court is different on
 
04:09:04.269 --> 04:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
um the same questions you're asking need
 
04:09:07.630 --> 04:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
to be applied to what happens usually in
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
family court and that is that counseling
 
04:09:13.590 --> 04:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
is ordered and they don't have to pay
 
04:09:15.630 --> 04:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
for it the court doesn't they don't
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
order it from in my experience they
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
don't order it for people who are
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
Indigent they order it for people they
 
04:09:25.149 --> 04:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
think can pay and it's really crass at
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
its worst um I knew somebody who was
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay ordered to more
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
counseling for both her kids and for her
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
not for the other parent who was the
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
abuser more than her her cost out of
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
pocket would be more than she made
 
04:09:46.269 --> 04:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
cleared per week it didn't bother the
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
judge because he knew her parents had
 
04:09:52.389 --> 04:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
money and they actually told her your
 
04:09:55.910 --> 04:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
parents can they can pay for this now
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's got to be illegal but it was done
 
04:10:03.550 --> 04:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
for years so this this bill says before
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
you order counseling and all your
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions about who's going to pay for
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
it and how does it order it and how long
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
is it going to last all of those
 
04:10:13.469 --> 04:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
questions should be applied to what what
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
is happening right now because
 
04:10:17.469 --> 04:10:17.479 align:start position:0%
counseling gets ordered all the time and
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
of course the court doesn't pay for
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
it let's say why not if the first
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
counseling you're going to order is
 
04:10:30.710 --> 04:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate the people there and see if
 
04:10:35.109 --> 04:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
they need counseling and if so what kind
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
so this is just saying if you think
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
counseling sounds like a good idea first
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
have the people evaluated don't just
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
start ordering
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
counseling for months at a time it was
 
04:10:53.910 --> 04:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
tragic one minute so um I'm I hope I've
 
04:10:56.830 --> 04:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
said this if you can make me clarify
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying if you're going to order
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
counseling let's first do an evaluation
 
04:11:06.070 --> 04:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
to see what kind should be ordered and
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
maybe even if it should be ordered I
 
04:11:10.830 --> 04:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
think counseling is very useful I'm not
 
04:11:12.910 --> 04:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
against it I've certainly gone to my
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
share over my decades so I'm not
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
negative at all about counseling but
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
let's figure out because the judge
 
04:11:23.269 --> 04:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
usually isn't a counselor who can figure
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
out you know the best assessment himself
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions I give my oh representative
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
sidel thank you madam Vice chair I just
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%

for the record I am here
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
representing the National Association of
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Psychological
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
Association both of my clients are
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to this legislation
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation is well-
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
intended but it is actually a solution
 
04:12:51.670 --> 04:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
in search of a
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
problem I was contacted by the prime
 
04:12:56.429 --> 04:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor and a constituent of hers last
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh week before last and they asked to
 
04:13:02.189 --> 04:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
meet with me which I did with my client
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
um from the social workers we had about
 
04:13:06.030 --> 04:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
an hourlong meeting and talked about
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation talked about the
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
amendment before you I won't discuss
 
04:13:14.429 --> 04:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
it and talked about what their concerns
 
04:13:14.439 --> 04:13:15.870 align:start position:0%
it and talked about what their concerns
truly

04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
truly
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
were this bill we initially began
 
04:13:24.030 --> 04:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
opposing this because it mandates an
 
04:13:26.750 --> 04:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
evaluation we are always opposed to
 
04:13:30.030 --> 04:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
courts mandating an evaluation just
 
04:13:32.750 --> 04:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
offand there needs to be a reason for an
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation the court can determine that
 
04:13:36.950 --> 04:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
but there needs to be a reason the bill
 
04:13:40.109 --> 04:13:40.119 align:start position:0%
and the amendment do not provide that
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
necessity through the conversation
 
04:13:42.520 --> 04:13:43.870 align:start position:0%
necessity through the conversation
though

04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
the constituent of the Prime
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned several times that her
 
04:13:53.109 --> 04:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
concern was that judges can order these
 
04:13:56.070 --> 04:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
now but they just aren't judges aren't
 
04:13:57.910 --> 04:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
ordering evaluations and she said we
 
04:13:59.910 --> 04:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
want to this bill is to make sure judges
 
04:14:02.149 --> 04:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
always order
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
evaluations as we talked more and more
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
it became clear to us that this is not
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
about kids being evaluated it's not
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
about evaluations at all this is a
 
04:14:14.269 --> 04:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
process issue in court that the
 
04:14:16.229 --> 04:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
constituent does not like the way the
 
04:14:19.109 --> 04:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
proceedings are going and I don't know
 
04:14:21.070 --> 04:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
whether her concerns have Merit or not
 
04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.670 --> 04:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
retraumatization that that's not going
 
04:14:31.950 --> 04:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
to get her to where she wants to be I
 
04:14:33.910 --> 04:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
actually said to her even if this bill
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
passes you will still be disappointed in
 
04:14:38.630 --> 04:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
in six months because what you want to
 
04:14:40.830 --> 04:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
happen is not going to happen we
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
encouraged her to talk to the
 
04:14:45.070 --> 04:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
administrator head of the family court I
 
04:14:47.149 --> 04:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
also spoke with the prime sponsor and
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
and walked her through some of the
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
pieces of a performance audit that this
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
really ought to be with chair Parson and
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
the task force he's working on regarding
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
the family court or perhaps a
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
performance audit of the family court to
 
04:15:03.870 --> 04:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
understand what truly is within their
 
04:15:07.149 --> 04:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as judges and what's
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
happening within the court system that
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
might be amendable to some kind of
 
04:15:13.630 --> 04:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
administrative or legislative
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much any questions
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
for M Mr
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
dejoy representative Raymond thank you
 
04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chairwoman um and thank you for
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so what um is the
 
04:15:35.550 --> 04:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
breadth of what judges can order now as
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
the law currently stands in cases of a
 
04:15:41.309 --> 04:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
divorce or a parenting plan that you
 
04:15:44.030 --> 04:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
know is a little bit tense
 
04:15:45.309 --> 04:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
representative I thank you very much for
 
04:15:47.109 --> 04:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
your question unfortunately I'm not a
 
04:15:48.990 --> 04:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
judge nor a lawyer nor do I play one on
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
TV I would turn to the gentleman to your
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
left who is a lawyer and might be able
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
to provide additional detail that I
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
knowing followup thank you madam
 
04:16:06.510 --> 04:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so maybe more in your
 
04:16:09.870 --> 04:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
Wheelhouse in the bill under section two
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
it lists all of the things that would
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
happen in a risk assessment um is is
 
04:16:20.189 --> 04:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
this stuff that a psychologist would be
 
04:16:23.710 --> 04:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
able to answer or do in a one-time
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
child so this is this is the other
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
reason why we we were opposing the bill
 
04:16:32.910 --> 04:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not what they're going to look
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
at so a risk assessment typically what a
 
04:16:38.469 --> 04:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
risk assessment means both for social
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
workers and psychologists and other
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals a risk
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
assessment means is the person at RIS
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
risk risk typically is determined by
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation and intent or
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
homicidal ideation and intent that is
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
typically what is
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
risk you can as a mental health
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
professional do a risk
 
04:17:00.269 --> 04:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
assessment of whether a child is a risk
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
of running away from a program of
 
04:17:06.990 --> 04:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
whether a child is at risk of some other
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
feature but a risk assessment in of
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
itself does
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
not um does not look at shared or
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
induced pers
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
delusions which quite honestly there is
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
not a scale that I'm familiar with that
 
04:17:25.870 --> 04:17:25.880 align:start position:0%
um assesses for prescor delusion that is
 
04:17:30.790 --> 04:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
learned over time through therapy not
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
typically except an extreme Cas is not
 
04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
typically from an
 
04:17:34.880 --> 04:17:36.429 align:start position:0%
typically from an
evaluation

04:17:36.429 --> 04:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
04:17:39.389 --> 04:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
um what this really sounds like is
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
another way to go at re um you had a
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.000 --> 04:17:54.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:54.030 --> 04:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
family thank you representative if you
 
04:17:56.080 --> 04:17:57.349 align:start position:0%
family thank you representative if you
shared

04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
shared
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
it there there is a one of the courts or
 
04:18:02.590 --> 04:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
two of the courts in the state last last
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years have
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
been requiring evaluations to try to
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
reconnect the family through um through
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
treatment reunification thank you so we
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
oppose reunification because it's not a
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
treatment it is not a treatment by any
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
recognized um body of practitioners what
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
it is is it's a way to coerce a child
 
04:18:28.910 --> 04:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
and or a spouse into reconnecting this
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
the way these um read representative
 
04:18:35.149 --> 04:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
Raymond is similar to what the intent of
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy was thank you that
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
was my Amendment last year we wrote that
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill so I appreciate it thank you thank
 
04:18:44.950 --> 04:18:44.960 align:start position:0%

04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
Indulgence you're welcome any further
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%

love thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:18:54.990 --> 04:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
um I've got more than a few
 
04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
constituents male and female who have uh
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
said that the the children use the word
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
coerced and that's the one I want to put
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
on they're being coerced into hating
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
staying away from people uh we had a
 
04:19:13.469 --> 04:19:13.479 align:start position:0%
woman testify earlier on a grandparents
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
Bill how her grandchildren are being
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
coerced to not even look at her when
 
04:19:22.030 --> 04:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
they're playing sports um wouldn't this
 
04:19:25.950 --> 04:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
bring out a a coercion of children and
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
how how low can you go using using
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
children to uh you know and and I boy I
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
I think the court needs to address it
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and this this would just put a put a put
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
an emphasis on hey Court you you're
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
you're missing out on this you know it's
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
already it might already be in in in
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
statute but you're ignoring it and um
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a reminder that that
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
be representative I I think let me try
 
04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
to pull out the question that I that I
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
heard to to respond to you um and as I
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
said my clients are not experts in the
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
court system they're not indicating that
 
04:20:07.950 --> 04:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's no issues with court process
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
they're indicating that this approach to
 
04:20:12.389 --> 04:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
address with to address a court process
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
issue was not the way to address it
 
04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
would an evaluation detect
 
04:20:22.149 --> 04:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
coercion I suppose an extreme cases it
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
could but it's equally likely that the
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
ceran wouldn't be present or the child
 
04:20:29.149 --> 04:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even talk to the
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
therapist you know there's a lot going
 
04:20:35.309 --> 04:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
on in Family
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
Court there are unfortunately winners
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
and losers through the family court
 
04:20:43.710 --> 04:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
process and many many times folks who
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
are not on the prevailing side feel as
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
though they didn't get a fair shake and
 
04:20:49.750 --> 04:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
they may not have but they just as
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
likely may have forcing a kid through
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
evaluations of this sort don't address
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
that I've been before this committee
 
04:21:06.830 --> 04:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
many many times over the last decade and
 
04:21:10.189 --> 04:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
typically I am testifying in support of
 
04:21:12.950 --> 04:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
keeping families together when whenever
 
04:21:12.960 --> 04:21:14.349 align:start position:0%
keeping families together when whenever
it's

04:21:14.349 --> 04:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
possible I think that is the
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
best benefit for the child the best
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
interest I think representative Raymond
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
asked before the best interest of the
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
child is typically to have two loving
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
parents we can't legislate
 
04:21:34.349 --> 04:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
that that's the truly unfortunate part
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
we can't legislate parents to be loving
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
parents I'd like to think that every
 
04:21:42.830 --> 04:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
parent is a loving parent and cares for
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
their kids I really do and that's where
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
I start from but I've I've seen stories
 
04:21:49.590 --> 04:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much for that uh
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
represent you all set you all set
 
04:22:04.750 --> 04:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative share uh speaking only as
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
of um I'm looking at uh for RSA 461 d a
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
colon 4 and as I read it it it asks the
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
court to develop a um a parenting
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
plan um uh Roman numeral one asked the
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
court to develop a parenting plan
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
um is it fair to say that even without
 
04:22:39.870 --> 04:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation the court can say to
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
the parties hey you know now it would be
 
04:22:48.510 --> 04:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
helpful for me if uh we if we could have
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh the child or children at issue uh
 
04:22:56.550 --> 04:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
talk to uh an individual um a a clinical
 
04:22:59.469 --> 04:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
psychologist or a therapist of some sort
 
04:23:01.630 --> 04:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
does as far as you understand it that's
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
not prohibited currently is it my
 
04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that could happen today
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.030 --> 04:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh any further
 
04:23:20.990 --> 04:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr toy next I'll

Krueger Mary you've asked for five
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
minutes yes thank you um and thank you
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and U members of the
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mary Krueger and
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the record I am an attorney with New
 
04:23:46.510 --> 04:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance we are a
 
04:23:49.990 --> 04:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide civil legal nonprofit
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
providing services to people in poverty
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
um one of the projects that we operate
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
is the domestic violence
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
um advocacy project of which I'm the
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
supervising attorney um last year we
 
04:24:09.630 --> 04:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
completed uh about just about 240 cases
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
which would include protection order
 
04:24:15.229 --> 04:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
cases es divorce cases and parenting
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
cases our victims that we represent um
 
04:24:22.469 --> 04:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
suffer High lethality violence um so
 
04:24:25.429 --> 04:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
these are the most risky cases um that
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
go through our court system I'm here to
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 335 FN on behalf of New
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistant and we are
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
doing this um mainly because there's a
 
04:24:40.950 --> 04:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
few reasons but one there's a strong
 
04:24:43.710 --> 04:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
policy in our state to consider the
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
children's best interest in these cases
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
and to really do no harm um this um Bill
 
04:24:54.149 --> 04:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
if uh enacted would harm children
 
04:24:59.309 --> 04:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
exposing them to um very
 
04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
invasive um
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
and uh evaluations where they're really
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
thrust into the middle of a contested
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
parenting case and that Al loan is
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
damaging to Children I've testified
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
before about how our courts really
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
encourage parents to try to reach
 
04:25:22.189 --> 04:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
agreements and try to think of the best
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
interest of their children so we're
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the cases where that's not
 
04:25:30.550 --> 04:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
happening um right now the courts can
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
appoint Guardians at lium um and their
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
job is to investigate issues that the
 
04:25:38.590 --> 04:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
court has or the parties have raised um
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
at issue in a contested divorce and
 
04:25:44.469 --> 04:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
parenting case and um that system does
 
04:25:45.950 --> 04:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
have its issues and I've been in front
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
of this committee over the last probably
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
10 years talking about that however that
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
is a system that exists where a guardian
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
ad lium could do an independent
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
investigation for the court when there's
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
allegations that one parent is um trying
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
to turn the other the children against
 
04:26:04.510 --> 04:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
the other parent which I think this is
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
what is uh being addressed here in this
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill as I read it um and I wanted to
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
point out for this committee that
 
04:26:15.149 --> 04:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
there's a case called in reberg and I
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
put it in the footnote to uh the written
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
testimony here for an important reason
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
and it talks about the right of privacy
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
of children in these contested cases
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
where neither parent is permitted in a
 
04:26:33.149 --> 04:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
contested custody case to invoke or
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
um um like wave a privilege for a child
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
from their therapeutic session and that
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
way the therapy uh session is considered
 
04:26:46.630 --> 04:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
a confidential space for a child to be
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
able to process everything without being
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
discovered by either parent as to what
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're disclosing and that's important
 
04:26:56.229 --> 04:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
to the therapeutic process and that case
 
04:26:59.510 --> 04:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
really talks about how that outweighs a
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
parent's fundamental right to parent a
 
04:27:03.630 --> 04:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
child in these cases and I think it's
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
really important because this implicates
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
that privacy issue for children and
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
could be really harmful to them if it's
 
04:27:13.950 --> 04:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
enacted and there's other ways for
 
04:27:16.269 --> 04:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
courts to get out this information
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
already so we're asking that this
 
04:27:23.590 --> 04:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh vote itl on this Bill thank
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%

uh person testifying had The Misfortune
 
04:28:35.870 --> 04:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
of Being a former student of mine so
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
um thinking about the the guardian at
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
lium the guardian at lium job is to to
 
04:28:45.030 --> 04:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
connect with the child uh if it's
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
appointed for the guardian ad item and
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh develop ideally a relationship with a
 
04:28:53.349 --> 04:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
child is that a fair way to put
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
it they wouldn't necessarily develop a
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
relationship with the child in my
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
experience um they might meet with the
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
child once or twice depending on how
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
long the case is going
 
04:29:03.520 --> 04:29:05.070 align:start position:0%
long the case is going
along

04:29:05.070 --> 04:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
along
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
so but they they can talk to a child's
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
therapist and that's one way to protect
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
that confidential information and they
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
can get orders to ensure that that be
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
kept confidential but they can utilize
 
04:29:19.550 --> 04:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
that information from a therapist to um
 
04:29:22.670 --> 04:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
inform how to make recommendations to
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%

appreciate Mr J de Joy's um test
 
04:30:15.070 --> 04:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I did meet with him um and
 
04:30:16.830 --> 04:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
this bill came to light because of his
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
previous testimony on reunification
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
therapy that a risk assessment if
 
04:30:22.990 --> 04:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
anything should be ordered by these
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
judges they should be ordering nothing
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
more than a risk assessment so that's
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
how this bill came to light
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
um testimony before this committee over
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
and over children being withheld from a

of comments I've

heard uh Dana alra nashille New
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I heard it said earlier
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
that this bill is a uh solution in
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
search of a problem I submit I'm the
 
04:32:46.630 --> 04:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
problem that this bill is a solution for
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
I've heard it earlier said that uh we
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
have winners and losers in family court
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
because it's an adversarial
 
04:32:59.429 --> 04:32:59.439 align:start position:0%
process I respectfully suggest the
 
04:33:03.189 --> 04:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
committee question that why must there
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
be winners and losers why can't there be
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
winners and
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
winners I've heard concerns raised about
 
04:33:14.109 --> 04:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
what does this
 
04:33:18.269 --> 04:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
cost I suggest at least in my own case
 
04:33:21.629 --> 04:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
it would have cost far less than over
 
04:33:25.869 --> 04:33:25.879 align:start position:0%
$110,000 in gal fees with the GL is a
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
lawyer and the best friend of the
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
judge would cost less than six figures
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
of lawyer fees in an adversarial
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding why are we subjecting
 
04:33:42.189 --> 04:33:42.199 align:start position:0%
children to adversarial proceedings
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
Alternatives why can't people trained in
 
04:33:50.400 --> 04:33:52.310 align:start position:0%
Alternatives why can't people trained in
therapeutic

04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
modalities have a crack at solving some
 
04:33:59.709 --> 04:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
of these family conflicts in divorce
 
04:34:02.230 --> 04:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
cases sort of before
 
04:34:07.629 --> 04:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
we escalate the conflict up to you know
 
04:34:10.990 --> 04:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
let's just go at it with a lawyer for
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
Mom a lawyer for pado and another lawyer
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
for the kid none of whom are trained in
 
04:34:15.520 --> 04:34:16.789 align:start position:0%
for the kid none of whom are trained in
therapeutic

04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
modalities uh many other states like
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
California at least for the G Pace
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
assign that uh sort of evaluation to
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
someone trained in therapy not
 
04:34:32.830 --> 04:34:32.840 align:start position:0%
law and uh so I would just submit to you
 
04:34:35.390 --> 04:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
I support this very very
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
much uh as fond as I am of sh uh I think
 
04:34:41.869 --> 04:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
May is fine
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh but I would very much like to see
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
this past and it would have gone a whole
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
way to reducing all of the burdens on
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
the judicial system that cost so much
 
04:34:55.390 --> 04:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
money so much pain and so much trauma
 
04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
over seven years of protracted
 
04:34:59.670 --> 04:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
litigation with that said I'll take
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any any questions
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%

caring parent from gtown to speak in
 
04:35:38.189 --> 04:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
335 as someone deeply invested in the
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
wellbe being of children in our state I
 
04:35:45.429 --> 04:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to raise several serious
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about this
 
04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislation first I must address the
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
concerning lack of transparency
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
surrounding this bill I attempted to
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
contact the primary sponsor of the bill
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
twice to learn more like what
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
individuals or organizations brought
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
this to their attention and have not yet
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
received a response this committee and
 
04:36:04.830 --> 04:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
the public deserve to know whose
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
interests are truly being served by this
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
legislation the Practical implementation
 
04:36:11.789 --> 04:36:11.799 align:start position:0%
of this bill presents significant
 
04:36:13.949 --> 04:36:13.959 align:start position:0%
problems it directly conflicts with the
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
law passed in 2024 prohibiting
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy and appears to be
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
merely a repackaged counter Bill the
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
provisions regarding reun reunification
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
therapy and the requirement for therapy
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
to be recommended by both parties and
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
accepted by Insurance are in direct
 
04:36:32.990 --> 04:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
conflict with HP
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
335 of particular concern is the
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
requirement for core ordered
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
psychological evaluations and risk
 
04:36:41.869 --> 04:36:41.879 align:start position:0%
assessments these evaluations which
 
04:36:43.789 --> 04:36:43.799 align:start position:0%
typically cost thousands of dollars are
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
not covered by Insurance furthermore
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
finding qualified providers who can
 
04:36:50.470 --> 04:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
complete these evaluations within the
 
04:36:53.230 --> 04:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
Bill's 14-day requirement is virtually
 
04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
impossible in our state this creates an
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable financial burden
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
particularly impacting domestic violence
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
survivors who may already be struggling
 
04:37:04.510 --> 04:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
with limited resources and it is not
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
uncommon for coercive control
 
04:37:08.429 --> 04:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
perpetrators to intentionally Force
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
former partners into financial debt or
 
04:37:14.349 --> 04:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
impoverish using the family court system
 
04:37:16.269 --> 04:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
we must also consider the traumatic
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
impact of mandatory psychological
 
04:37:21.390 --> 04:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
evaluations especially on children as a
 
04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
caring and protective parent I canot
 
04:37:25.629 --> 04:37:25.639 align:start position:0%
emphasize enough how forcing children to
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
undergo such evaluations can cause
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
lasting psychological harm we do not
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
want to be an institution contributing
 
04:37:34.590 --> 04:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
to adverse childhood
 
04:37:36.590 --> 04:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
experiences I challenge this committee
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
to investigate who stands to financially
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from this legislation more
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
importantly I urge you to find even one
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
documented case where forced therapy
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
successfully restored a resistant parent
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
child relationship love and connection
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
is organic and willing therapy as well
 
04:37:57.070 --> 04:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
by its very nature cannot be forced when
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
we attempt to do so we strip it of its
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
healing potential and transform it into
 
04:38:04.349 --> 04:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
a punishment the very opposite of its
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
intended purpose therapy is a powerful
 
04:38:09.709 --> 04:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
tool of resiliency and we do not want to
 
04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
remove that tool from the tool blocks of
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
parents and children who may come to
 
04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
need it now or in their future by making
 
04:38:20.230 --> 04:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
therapy a painful coercive and negative
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
experience at its core this bill appears
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
to be built around the concept of
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
Parental alienation syndrome a debunked
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
theory that has become the only mental
 
04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:32.561 align:start position:0%
illness apologies to the man on the left
 
04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed by attorneys rather than
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
04:38:37.789 --> 04:38:37.799 align:start position:0%
professionals parental alienation
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
syndrome is frequently used as a counter
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
claim in Family Court when abuse
 
04:38:44.590 --> 04:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
allegations arise potentially putting
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
Children at Risk there is a reason why
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
you are not seeing the words
 
04:38:50.910 --> 04:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
reunification therapy or parental
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
alienation syndrome in this bill
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
although the alternative words used in
 
04:38:58.150 --> 04:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
it are just a guise our state just
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
prohibited this very act HB 335
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
proposes children are human beings with
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
valid feelings and experiences they like
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
adults naturally withdraw from
 
04:39:12.109 --> 04:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
situations where they feel feel unsafe
 
04:39:14.670 --> 04:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
or neglected it is not a syndrome
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
requiring forced Intervention when a
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
child resists contact with someone who
 
04:39:21.789 --> 04:39:21.799 align:start position:0%
has cause them harm it is a natural
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
protective response let's keep our
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
attention where it best serves the
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of children
 
04:39:30.910 --> 04:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
identifying and preventing abuse and
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
neglect as legislators parents and
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
community members we have a fundamental
 
04:39:37.628 --> 04:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility to protect New
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's children this bail Bill
 
04:39:42.270 --> 04:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
fails to serve their best interests
 
04:39:44.550 --> 04:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
lacks transparency and will cause more
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
harm than good thank you will you take
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
anyone seeing none thank you for your
 
04:40:02.628 --> 04:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.628 --> 04:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
335 and I don't see anybody making a Mad
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
Dash for
 
04:40:09.390 --> 04:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
them so with that I will close the
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%

04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee please um number one we are
 
04:40:24.750 --> 04:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
getting growing pressure from the
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
speaker's office they say that we have a
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
habit of sending them bills that go on a
 
04:40:29.840 --> 04:40:31.510 align:start position:0%
habit of sending them bills that go on a
consent

04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
consent
