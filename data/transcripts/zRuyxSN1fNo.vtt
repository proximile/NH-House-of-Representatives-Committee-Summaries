thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee I once again and before you
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
asking you to consider a bill um
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
hp25 if you recall uh we had last year
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
and passed it out of committee this bill
 
00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
originated um based on an observance by
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
the general public that some police
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
departments were posting post arrest
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
photographs of arrestes on social media
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
before they had been convicted of a
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
crime and we determined that that was
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
not a good thing because those pictures
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
once out there stayed there and if a
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
person were found not guilty or if the
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
charges were dismissed the pictures were
 
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
still out there associated with them of
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
the crime and it would make future
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
employment difficulty and and various
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
other things besides um you know General
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
embarrassment in the public so we felt
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
that that was not a good thing so we
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
passed a very similar Bill to this last
 
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
year that prohibited that um I believe
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
it got caught up in the the Senate
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
Omnibus um Whirlwind and and didn't go
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
anywhere so we're bringing it back um I
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
have offered an amendment I hope
 
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
everyone has it this morning um the
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
amendment I've offered just puts a
 
00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
little more clarity
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
into when um the police can
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
actually release these photos um if
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
we'll just go over it real quick it's
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
basically the same thing as last year
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
but what it says this law enforcement
 
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
office May publish post arrest photos
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
related to a crime for which a subject
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
has not been convicted if the subject
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
fails to appear before the court after
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
having been granted bail or is suspected
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
of committing a subsequent crime while
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
on bail and the assistance of the public
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
is necessary to locate the subject after
 
00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
routine non-public methods of location
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
have been exhausted so what that
 
00:08:00.149 --> 00:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
basically means is if someone's granted
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
bail and they default on it and don't
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
show up in court and the police need to
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
find them and they've used routine
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
methods such as checking their address
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
checking their place of work um they
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
made them publish the photo for the
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
assistance of the public and looking for
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
that person and the same applies if the
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
person commits another crime while
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're on bail and the police needed
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
assistance in finding
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
them um It also says law enforcement May
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
release post arrest photos the subject
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
presents an imminent immediate danger to
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
the public and the release of the photo
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
as necessary for Public Safety um and
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
there's a numerous scenarios where you
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
can imagine where someone needs to be
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
found because they're a danger to their
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
spouse or to a child or what have you
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
and the police need to find them so
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
basically that's the bill in the
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
amendment in the nutshell I understand
 
00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
there may be another amendment coming
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
forth that would impose penalties on the
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
police for violating this we considered
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
that option last year and we decided
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
that it was not a good idea um the the
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
public has a common law right to sue if
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
the police violate the laws if there
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
were is sort of pass implementing a fine
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
such as $10,000 against the police um
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
first of all that's probably about a
 
00:09:16.509 --> 00:09:16.519 align:start position:0%
third or fourth of a of a policeman's
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
salary when it could be a mistake um so
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
I feel like leaving that out just
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
putting the law as it is if they violate
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
it the person wants to they're free to
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
Sue and prove their case in court
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
without um hanging a fine over the law
 
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.829 align:start position:0%
without um hanging a fine over the law
enforcement

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
um I I feel that we have a better chance
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
of getting this through without that in
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
there so with that I'm open to taking
 
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:47.310 align:start position:0%
there so with that I'm open to taking
any

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
questions represented
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
new just one quick question do you have
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
any opposition to the publication of uh
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
the names of uh of people uh who are
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
accused of these crimes so would
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
you uh do you think the publication of
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
names is acceptable but not the
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
photos yeah that thank you for the
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
question representative Muse that that's
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
a it's a really fine line we walk
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
because at the same time uh we don't
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
want the police to be arresting people
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
in secret and the public have no access
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
or idea who they're taking or holding so
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's a difficult thing I feel like
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
we're we're kind of we're splitting the
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
splitting the baby on this one and the
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
photographs um are easily recognizable
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
the names are are can be published uh
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
they're a public record and I think that
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
the public has a right to know who the
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
police are taking and holding so yeah
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's a difficult question but I I
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
feel like we're GNA with the picture at
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
least that's some
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you

00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
you just want to remind members of the
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
public for the purposes of this hearing
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
W Jon
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
wheeler if there are any members of the
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
public that have their hands that wish
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
hear hello can you hear me yes hear okay
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I just wanted
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill very briefly just
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
because I think that putting a the the
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
distribution of arrest
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
photos in the media or in the public
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
guilty you know I grew up thinking that
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know you're innocent until proven
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
guilty but something like this with the
 
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
sensationalization of pictures that go
 
00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
out in the media of someone who isn't
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
even convicted of a crime who has just
 
00:13:29.199 --> 00:13:29.910 align:start position:0%
even convicted of a crime who has just
been

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
arrested creates the Assumption of
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
guilty before proven innocent or guilty
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
before proven anything before the case
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
has even been deliberated on uh and you
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
know this is a problem with the media
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
but it's also something that we can
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
address here through the legislature uh
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that members of this
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
body would vote um to protect civil
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
liberties and and help people uh avoid
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
this media sensationalization you know
 
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
media sensation uh that can be created
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
through this type of process so thank
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%

n thank you chairman and thank you um my
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
members here um I just wanted to add a
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
couple of few things that um are worth
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
mentioning this was on consent calendar
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
last year I approached um representative
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
Roy and we worked in a bipartisan manner
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
on this issue for the last uh year and a
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
half I think that representative
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
pentakus also worked on this last year
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
so there was a really good faith effort
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
in to address this problem I had
 
00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
constituents reach out to me um one um
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
had a job and and um driving elderly uh
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
folks to appointments and such and um
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
they Googled her and found her arrest
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
photo um and it was a really long time
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
ago and they then rescinded her job
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
offer um and uh this was a dire
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
situation in which um she had no income
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
and a and a child and um I I really
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
don't I I it really hurt that she
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't be given a second chance at um
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
being a member of society I had another
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
constituent reach out to me um for
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
something that they did a really long
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
time ago as well and they were denied
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
housing um so this is happening in our
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
state um people are being denied a
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
second chance after serving their time
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
or even being Innocent but since some of
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
these police stations on their Facebook
 
00:17:04.029 --> 00:17:04.039 align:start position:0%
pages have
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
sensationalized like I don't know if
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
it's for morale boosting or what have
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
you um for for doing a good job but the
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
the repercussions of posting something
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
that isn't necessarily um affecting
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
other people isn't violent or self
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
Haring um and also before conviction and
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
and you see a whole town then commenting
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
and it it it it fuels this mob mentality
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
where these these people's lives are
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
suddenly destroyed before they're even
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
proven guilty or even if um they weren't
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
and to move on with their lives it's
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
it's all on the internet forever for
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
everyone to see so I really think that
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
compassion needs to be brought back um
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
to how we notify the public of what's
 
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
going on and this bill specifically um
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't take away anything that would be
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
a danger to the public I want to make
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
that very clear um representative Roy
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
and I we know we have a duty to inform
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
the public if there's an uh really D
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
like somebody's on right now in
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester as an example we had somebody
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
just shoot somebody and kill them and
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're still at large you know that's a
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
perfect example of yeah share that photo
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
call hotline we need Public Safety is at
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
risk right now so that this is this bill
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
does not get rid of that that is crucial
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
to understand this bill is specifically
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
designed for people that are not a
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
threat to the public and um you know
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
have minor infractions that that didn't
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
affect anybody's else's life uh shall we
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
say so I just want to say that and again
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
end with this was on the consent
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
calendar this was a big bipartisan
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
effort just to give people in our
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
communities a fair Shake uh isn't
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
innocent till proven
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
guilty thank you thank you
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh the first two cases
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
that you explained about you know the
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
loans and um or where she worked um were
 
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
they convicted or they were just accused
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
because I think this bill only does
 
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.710 align:start position:0%
because I think this bill only does
accused

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
accused
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:40.710 align:start position:0%
accused
correct

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
can you um please tell me if you see
 
00:19:45.549 --> 00:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
that on a certain line so I can jump
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
up a followup Mr chairman representative
 
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
you recognized for a followup thank you
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um well no what what I'm
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
getting at is your first you you said
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
about this lady that drove for this um
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
appointments if I understand the bill
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
correctly the bill only if you're
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
accused so I'm just curious was this
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
lady you know charged and if that's the
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
case this bill wouldn't have helped her
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm just confused on what the
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill I was told she wasn't it was for a
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
minor driving
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
infraction um uh
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
again it's it turns out when we hear
 
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
stories from constituents sometimes um
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
we don't always get the full story but I
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
did some research um and you know even
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
if this weren't to help her I'm hoping
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
this will help others because I have uh
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
looked at Facebook responses of of
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
police uh police offices around our
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
state and I I'm saddened that this is
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
starting to become a trend on social
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
media so I have I have seen this
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times from multiple different
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
police uh departments so I'm not I can't
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
accurately say if this bill would have
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
helped her I'd like to believe it would
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have the entire story on that
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
part but I've had heard complaints in
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
regards to this and like I said I've
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
seen the post and I just don't think
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's fair I don't think that you can
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
tell the public one thing you can say
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
watch out for this person they're a
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
danger but to Poe somebody that's not a
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
danger or risk to society shame them
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
either for mental health issues
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders and then get
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
keep the comments open it's one thing to
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
also notify the public but then have a
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
whole the comment section open so people
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
can say the most abhorent things uh and
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
take away someone's Humanity um this is
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
really that's the intent this bill so I
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
hope it would help her um I I realized
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
there was a problem when she came to me
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
her specific case though I I cannot say
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
raised see no hands raised
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative may your excuse thank you
 
00:22:24.269 --> 00:22:24.279 align:start position:0%

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%

smart Justice organizer for the American
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
civil liberties Union of New Hampshire
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
and I will be testifying in support of
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:04.390 align:start position:0%
this legislation
today

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
um there's there's many things that have
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
been said already uh concerning uh mug
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
shots and what that means when it's
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
pre-conviction uh a mug shot captures an
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
individual when they're often at their
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
worst moments in um in life and they are
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
taken at a time when people are supposed
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
to be presumed innocent and often times
 
00:23:27.789 --> 00:23:27.799 align:start position:0%
there is a a stigma um of assumed guilt
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
that happens or comes with a mug shot
 
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.750 align:start position:0%
that happens or comes with a mug shot
being

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
taken and if mug shots are publicly
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
released before conviction there is no
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
way to revoke them if the person is
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
acquitted or charges against them are
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
subsequently dropped later on so instead
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
a mugshot will live um you know
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
indefinitely online and it will follow
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
individuals even after their cases have
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
been resolved and you know and taken
 
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.750 align:start position:0%
been resolved and you know and taken
care

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
of I do you know I
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
I could I could go more into that but I
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
just wan to I do want to say this that
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
in 2005 I I myself have been had my mug
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
shot put on the front page of a
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
newspaper and in 2005
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
um my mother ended up in CMC Hospital
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
for several days because the first time
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
she found out from a stressinduced heart
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
attack from seeing my mug shot on the
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
newspaper before I was convinced IED so
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just the individual um who
 
00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
Presumed Innocent that
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh that suffers but also people around
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
them um as well I do want to I do want
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
to you know state that the ACLU strongly
 
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
does support chapter 91a and does
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
believe in public
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
transparency however uh this is one of
 
00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
the rare cases where the Public's
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
interest in someone's mug shot is
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the prejudicial nature of
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
a mug shot before there's even been a
 
00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.389 align:start position:0%
a mug shot before there's even been a
convict

00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
convict
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
and mug chubs do not provide any
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
information that cannot be obtained from
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
a police report or any other written
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
materials and I do want to say if the
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
Press wants a photo of someone who has
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
been arrested there's no reason why they
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
cannot attend the arraignment or any
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
other court proceedings that will happen
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
and get their pictures there um and we
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
would not be the only state to do this
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
New York has restricted uh similar
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
access to mshot information though this
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is more targeting in so far
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
as it's limited to pre-conviction mug
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
shots um I do want to state that this
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
bill does not prevent law enforcement
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
from releasing the details of an arrest
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
including someone's name as was stated
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
earlier and it it only restricts the
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
release of a pre-conviction mug shot
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
which is uniquely
 
00:25:49.389 --> 00:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
prejudicial uh this bill does allow for
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
a disclosure pre-conviction where the
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
subject of the photo is a fugitive from
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
Justice as was stated and if they pose
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
an immediate and ongoing danger to
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
Public Safety where disclosure is
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to convey a witness or police
 
00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:03.799 align:start position:0%
officers in the performance of any valid
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
function so for these reasons and more I
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
support this legislation the ACLU New
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supports this legislation and
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
we hope that you will vote a to pass I'm
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your
 
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:25.559 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
witness is
 
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:36.269 align:start position:0%
witness is
excused

00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:37.909 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
Hopper point of our order Mr chairman
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
what's the time limit for testimonies or
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
is there one today you're recognized for
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
a point of order the chair is setting a
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
TW minute time limit however our next
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing is until
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
9:45 so there it is at the discuss chair
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
to allow a witness to go beyond that
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
because there was no one signed up to
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
testify with their hands
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
raised U I love two witnesses to
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
actually go well beyond the time limit
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
but when we are in time constraint that
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
you seeing no members of the public with
 
00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
their hands
 
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.110 align:start position:0%
their hands
[Music]

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
raised now close the public hearing on H
 
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.149 align:start position:0%
raised now close the public hearing on H

125

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
125
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair we had uh uh signing in in
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
support of the bill uh were 94 people
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
order uh Mr chairman I keep hearing a
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
telephone if somebody could mute that
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
telephone if that keeps going off that
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
would be very appreciative I think it's
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
disruptive of the committee here
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
although I agree that that telephone
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
going off is extremely disruptive I
 
00:28:06.679 --> 00:28:07.789 align:start position:0%
going off is extremely disruptive I
don't

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
think but whoever's telephone is on
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
dat generally speaking we're not
 
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to use electronic devices in
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
the room obviously we have the
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
exceptions because we're
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
all so please be respectful thank we'll
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
representing Dave testerman I'm from
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
mayor act two area uh represents
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hill I introduced this bill because uh a
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
few months ago or actually more than a
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
few months
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
ago Apple loaded a uh app on your iPhone
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
if you have an iPhone and Ed it it did
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
not activate it but what it was it was
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
for locating you and times of
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
co uh and I objected to the fact that
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
they could actually activate it without
 
00:47:39.069 --> 00:47:39.079 align:start position:0%
me knowing and I looked into it and
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are apps like this which
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
would activate when you're within a few
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
feet of another person who also had a
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
similar uh piece of software and the
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
need for it was to effectively put a
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
Scarlet a on your forehead so that if
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
you uh had a vaccination or didn't have
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
a vaccination or you know you had you'd
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
been tested positive for uh co uh they
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
could notify a person in close proximity
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
of you uh that you know you were uh a
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
deplorable uh and I objected to this so
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it says if
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to put that kind of a
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
software on and activate it you need to
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
let the person know now I what worries
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
me and I don't know how to cure it is
 
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
that even with that we all get software
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
on we just keep saying okay okay with
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
licenses and we seldom ever read them so
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
I can probably get uh burn on this
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
particular uh app if I'm not careful but
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
I I wanted to make this abundantly clear
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
that this kind of of an application in
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
take represented true you recognized for
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chair thank

thank you representative for taking my
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
question um nobody's going to sneak an
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
app onto my
 
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.710 align:start position:0%
app onto my
phone

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
but in this in this
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
case the app could be on your phone when
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
you've got a a new a new
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%

older phones and I don't know if there's
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
any if they can be updated at

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%

representative TR you recogniz for a
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
followup question than Mr chair no what
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
I meant is somebody goes out and buys a
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
new phone a brand new phone that does
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
everything do those phones could those
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
phones come with this app that you
 
00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know
 
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know
of

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
yes since the these companies who make
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
these phones send out updates to the
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
software there's one I was talking about
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
just showed up one day on my phone but
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%

question is this bill saying that um no
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
one can have this kind of app on their
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
phone in the state of New
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says nobody can have it on
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
their phones if they don't want
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%

00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
be some percentage of the people who
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%

there was a
 
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.230 align:start position:0%
there was a
location

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%

only way I found out about it was
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
reading some technical journals and I
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
told me where to look and I said yeah
 
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.430 align:start position:0%
told me where to look and I said yeah
it's

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%

a
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
followup was the app activated without

the
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
app it was not activated it Apple
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
knowing that it would be
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
controversial didn't they installed it
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
but they didn't turn it
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Bradley recognize for
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
a question thank you chair
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
um do you use the easy pass that the
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
state gave
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
do you recognize for a fall off question
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
um did you know there's a Tracker in the
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass I
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
you representative giz for a question I
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
know that that there's a group that you
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
could report this to I don't know
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's the FCC or it might be have
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
on I thought I would do it just in the
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
states I mean at the state level my
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
experience in trying to get something
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
through the federal agencies like FK and
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
so on has been been has not been very
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
successful so I didn't do I
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
didn't tell them that they couldn't do
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
it there's no there's no way for me to
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
stop them from putting it
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
on there is maybe a way to stop them
 
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.829 align:start position:0%
on there is maybe a way to stop them
from

00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
activating from making making me

representative for taking my question do
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
I understand correctly that the exposure
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
notifications app on the iPhone is not
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
functional in New Hampshire as it
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
requires the active
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
participation of DHHS and they've
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
announced no intention uh to participate
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:54:55.319 --> 00:54:58.150 align:start position:0%

00:55:37.029 --> 00:55:37.039 align:start position:0%
you want them to clearly tell us that
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
they're doing that but then you know
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
what are you going to do about the NSA
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
that's doing the same thing I can't stop
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
everybody I can just raise a hand and
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
say I really don't like
 
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
represent taking my question or twoing
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
so reading the propose LSR you have in
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
testimony can you speak up please can
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
you hear
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
me yes please speak
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
louder unless I'm
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
yelling you don't mind okay can you hear
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
me now yes okay so in reading your uh
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
proposed LSR and listening to testimony
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to understand how in the
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
LSR it says that uh no person shall
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
without consent Place locate or install
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
an electronic device as we all know that
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
those phones are not really manufactured
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh and come pre uh
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
downloaded with these apps unless you
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
specifically download an another app so
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
how based on this are we looking to
 
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.349 align:start position:0%
how based on this are we looking to
enforce

00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh the way I would enforce it is uh each
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
phone store or person selling a phone in
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would have to have the
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
ability uh to go in and and turn it off
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh and when they're bringing a phone
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire not when when a
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
company is trying to sell a phone in New
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they would know that for New
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have to have certain
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.829 align:start position:0%
 
difficult

00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
follow ask for a followup
 
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
question well thinking of that
 
00:57:51.549 --> 00:57:51.559 align:start position:0%
terminology most uh phones that I have
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
bought uh have been um sealed and most
 
00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
customers would want a phone that hasn't
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
been already opened and uh taken out and
 
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.190 align:start position:0%
been already opened and uh taken out and
unload

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
unload
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh turned on I guess would be would you
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
bre thank you the question or the
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
comment the the way I would would see it
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
is if I go to the
 
00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
local Apple Store uh when I picked up
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
the phone from them they would take it
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
out just to
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
and you know would would help me set it
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
up and part of the setup would be
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
shutting that off if I didn't want
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
it it it's not going to be easy and I
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
would like to make it difficult for the
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to install this hopefully
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
that representative green thank you Mr
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative Testament do you
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
know two questions is one is when did
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
you realize that this took half took H
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
when it happened that you saw it on
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
there and is it also on all phones other
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
Amazon just try to limit one
 
00:59:16.839 --> 00:59:18.870 align:start position:0%
Amazon just try to limit one
question

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
I I I realized it when I read about it
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
last summer time frame and uh and it was
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
specific to an iPhone I don't know
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
whether Android has it but I suspect
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
that they would probably follow suit if
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
they don't haven't already done it and I
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
just checked and yes this particular
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
kind of software this switch to to
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
there recogniz for a followup question
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh did you take it to
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
an Amazon store and see if they could
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands
 
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.069 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further hands
raised

01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
represent last question
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
thank and please speak up we will not
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
take offense if we feel that you're
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
yelling I'll try to maybe use a
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
different device after this uh what is
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
the penal
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
if they do not
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
comply excuse me I I didn't understand
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
you what is the penalty if they do not
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
comply with this I don't have one
 
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
one representative KN recognize for a
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.029 align:start position:0%
one representative KN recognize for a
question

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair and thank you for
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um don't you think
 
01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's the consumer's responsibility to
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
understand the product they're buying
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
and know how to operate it and use its
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
functions I fully agree that's why I'm
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
asking they can install this software at
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
least if they if they fully
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
inform the the consumer that it's there
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
and that they can either turn it on or
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
turn it off so I I agree with you
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
P followup
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
chair now you recognize for a followup
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
question are you aware that there's
 
01:01:44.109 --> 01:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
already information before buying this
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
product on labels and signed contracts
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
to notify the consumer of of of exactly
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
these functions I I'm not I
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of times we all
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
install stuff on our our phones our
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
computers and it says you know
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
by yes I would um listening to the
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill there seem to be
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
um over over displaying or hysteria and
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
I think that there's a huge difference
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
between displaying a firearm to prevent
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
something if you are being threat to
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
dispense that threat versus walking into
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%

raised the matter we question Mr chair
excuse

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
me Mr chairman I have to oppose this uh
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
motion off the pass uh we have no
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
definition for display firearms and is
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
very ambiguous um so I can't uh support
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
law represent
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
news yes Mr chairman we also heard uh
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
testimony uh that the difference between
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
display uh and brandishing uh is very uh
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
ambiguous it's not something that's
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
actually defined in our statute I know
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time on that on the
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing but but I think one of
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
the the more persuasive pieces of
 
01:12:59.590 --> 01:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that I heard uh was when the
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
topic of corve control was discussed so
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
in essence the the very act of showing
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
somebody a firearm in a confrontational
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
situation um is an act of conser of
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
coercive control um and one of the
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
reasons why this is in our statute now
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
is this this is an act of violence uh
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
and this is something that uh should not
 
01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
be removed from our statute it's
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
place Senator
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
Baron thank you Mr chairman there was no
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill I'm trying to
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
recall if that was
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
Su there's been no amendments presented
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chairman I'm opposed
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
to this bill also um my main fear is
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
that uh when we have people displaying
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
guns and road rage incidents um it seems
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
like a very dangerous situation to me
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
you get one display one then the other
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
one will have a shootout on one of the
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
roads um I think it's just a very
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%

Knight

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
Knight
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um I'm opposed to it
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
as well I remember asking the question
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
of one of the
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
sponsors um what his intent was and he
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
said he wanted to scare people so they
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh escalate things and he also
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
stated he'd respect somebody that would
 
01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
try and scare him brandishing or um
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
displaying their firearm as well um I I
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
just don't feel comfortable with the the
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
intent that that was given to us on the
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
record by the sponsors I think that this
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
is has very dangerous consequences and
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
hasn't been uh thought out properly and
 
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
um I I I will say that if this were to
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
pass I could see a major increase in
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
deaths going up due to firearms in our
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
wel I would only suggest
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
that and a good example of a
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
display would be you're walking down the
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
street somebody comes out of an alley
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
and says empty your
 
01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:46.840 align:start position:0%
pockets you open your coat and show that
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
on and curent and the guy runs down the
 
01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
street grabs the C and says this guy
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
Just sh me with a fire on
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
that's not the way it's supposed to be
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
the criminals are supposed to be the
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
ones who get caught not the victims and
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
display it's already in
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
statute 631 col
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
4 Page
 
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
584 in our
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
book I think this just a continuation of
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that we put in place several
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
years ago when what bird up in
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
molbo got
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
convicted of threatening a woman who had
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
trespassed on his property he never
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
showed the gun but it was in his uh in
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
his belt in the back of him when he
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
turned around to go in the house she saw
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
the gun and went down to the police
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
station and turned him in he got
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
convicted that was that's why we have
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
something in 6314
 
01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:02.550 align:start position:0%
something in 6314
now

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
I'm definitely against um supporting
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
this bill one of the things that the
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
same the day that we heard this in the
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
hearing I was online and looking up the
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
definition of brandish and sort of was
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
waiting till we got to this point um
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
synonym flash trout out we display
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
this port and that's literally in the
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
dictionary so for you to say that
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
display anything other than brandish I
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
you so in regards to display versus
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
brandish that's when I first read looked
 
01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
at this bill I I had to same concern
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
under the federal
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
definition paraphrasing but
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
brandishing is when you display a
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
firearm and it's coupled with a
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
threat and that threat is particularly
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
meant to intimidate some New Hampshire's
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
been an open carry state as long as I
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
can remember before long before was a
 
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.870 align:start position:0%
can remember before long before was a
constitutional

01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
carrier open carrying is as a example of
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
displ hearing a lot of the the testimony
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
comments is really I watch reason why I
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
support this bill because what I'm
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
hearing is that anytime someone displays
 
01:18:31.629 --> 01:18:31.639 align:start position:0%
a fire on people are considering it a
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
threat and that's the exact problem in
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
the law that this is intended to fix and
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
for that I would be supporting the
 
01:18:39.159 --> 01:18:45.870 align:start position:0%
for that I would be supporting the
motion

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
ofes representative hoer thank you Mr
 
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
chair um I'd like to to uh Del into this
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
idea of fors of control my grandson's 6'
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
one and he's pretty strong so when he
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
asked me for a to stop at
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
Subway I could think that that's force
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
of control but it really isn't I mean we
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
we there's people the examples used are
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
people that have a gun are in a dominant
 
01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:18.030 align:start position:0%
people that have a gun are in a dominant
situ

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
situ
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
position but that's really true
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
throughout our lives always situation
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
where there is somebody in in the room
 
01:19:28.629 --> 01:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
that is more dominant or in control
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
right now you're the chairman of the
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee so is that course of control I
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
mean I I think it's
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
um unrealistic to think that we aren't
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
there isn't full birth of control
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
throughout our lives and we have to
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.639 --> 01:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair i' mentioned some
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
time before when we were discussing this
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
that there are people and I do know some
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
people that would not shoot a person but
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
they carry an empty gun it's not loaded
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
and this would be a way for them further
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:25.270 align:start position:0%
 
themselves

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
um can you um how many people supported
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
it and how many opposed it that day I
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
didn't bring my notes
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%

Marson according to Muse at the time I
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
wrote down
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%

01:20:53.639 --> 01:20:55.390 align:start position:0%
was
156

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
156
 
01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.270 align:start position:0%
156
thank

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.910 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
chairman during a lot of these standard
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
ground bills we we heard a lot of people
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
testify and say well I'm sure that it's
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
you know it's traumatizing to people
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
that been in this situation
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
but but I'm afraid but what about my
 
01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:25.390 align:start position:0%
but but I'm afraid but what about my
feelings

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
I think everybody needs to step
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
back because you are that person that is
 
01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.390 align:start position:0%
back because you are that person that is
being

01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
threatened or your loved one is being
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
threatened and you're the one that has
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to stop it with just showing
 
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
the handle of a
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
firearm you're the good
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
guy you are the good
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
guy walking
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
in to negotiate a contract and taking
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
out your firearm and plac on the table
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
well now you're a
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
jerk but using a
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
tool as representative bden had stated
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
not all tools are meant for everybody to
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
use right her husband might not be great
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
with the chainsaw but mine is and if I
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
have the ability and I'm trained and I
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
know how to use my firearm and so do
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in my family we should be able
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
to use it and let me just also say that
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
if I'm in a convenience store with any
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
single person in this room
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
room and someone's trying to threaten
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
your life I will protect you by showing
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
that I can that is all thank
 
01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
Bradley um thank you chairman I will be
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
voting against this bill I think it's
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
dangerous I think it's unclear of what
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
um you know we keep talking about
 
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
display and brandishing but it's still
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
not clear and rep roads I app appreciate
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
that you do get training I think that's
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's fantastic but not everybody does
 
01:23:00.990 --> 01:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
and when I go to the grocery store if
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
I'm bumping into somebody and they turn
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
around and show me something and I have
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
my two kids with me that's scary I don't
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
care and I appreciate that you took the
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
time to get trained I have no idea what
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
type of training that person has and all
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
I want to do is go grab eggs and milk
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
and now I am worried so I appreciate
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
what you've said but it's a slippery
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
slope and if everybody has a chance to
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
be walking around brandishing or
 
01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
displaying a
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
weapon I mean what are we asking for
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
this is this is
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
ridiculous um that's that's I just think
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
this is a scary bill this makes no sense
 
01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.679 --> 01:23:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
just my
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
just my
perspective

01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
1986 1987 as far as I can remember
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
always and I think the concern is that
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
by open carrying you are disppointed a
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
fire and it's it's a lawful act and it
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
always has been simply to open car
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
before it became a constitutional carry
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
state if you didn't have a you actually
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
had the open car the per was to conceal
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
so open caring is is is a traditional
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
long exercise but what I'm hearing is
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
that people find that act to be in of
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
itself threaten and which would then if
 
01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're displaying and threatening
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
someone you are now brish now I will say
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
personally I I I don't open car I I
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't find need to and to be honest most
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
people don't but it doesn't mean that
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's simply if someone is open caring
 
01:24:53.639 --> 01:24:55.109 align:start position:0%
it's simply if someone is open caring
they

01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:24:55.119 --> 01:24:56.149 align:start position:0%
they
they

01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
threat so I mean police officers do it
 
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis a public trust
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
there I just I'm just explaining that
 
01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that the difference
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
between brandishing and displaying needs
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
to be distinguish displ does not involve
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
KN thank you I really appreciate
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Road's passion on this I
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
share a similar passion but for the
 
01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
opposite opinion I feel as someone who
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
threatened uh multiple times in my life
 
01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:40.910 align:start position:0%
threatened uh multiple times in my life
I

01:25:40.910 --> 01:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
feel that everyone also has a right at
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
least in my district to feel
 
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
safe and I've heard
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelming amount of my constituents
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to me
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill makes them feel less safe
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I heard that was the intent also of
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bill if I hear a legislator that's
 
01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
saying their intent is to scare people
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
and we have overwhelming amount of
 
01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
numbers of our own people and by the way
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair with all due respect for both
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
sides on a bipartisan issue you can
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
change the form we should be requiring
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
people to the state they're from the
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
city in the zip code and it's on record
 
01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
that they're telling the truth and we
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
need to amend that form the sign and
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
Sheet immediately for both bipartisan
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
reasons and I have to say that if we can
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
determine people in New Hampshire and
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're representing them and hearing
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
their voices those numbers those are
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
facts that's the data and also yes you
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
have a right to protect yourself and yes
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know what it's already there in in
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that you can do this we
 
01:27:01.229 --> 01:27:01.239 align:start position:0%
can't determine how many people are
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
trained we want to bring more guns for
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
them where there was no data on and then
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
there was no necessary requirements on
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
how to use this uh tool properly there
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
there's just a complete Black Hole when
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
it comes to accountability on this law
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
and that means you can get away with
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
murder and that scares people and I just
 
01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
want to make that really clear that you
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
can protect yourself but other people
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
they have a right also to feel safe and
 
01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
be protected by their representatives
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
and vouch for for for the things that
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
they need to continue their lives and go
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
to the grocery store without feeling
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
like all of a sudden everybody has a gun
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
other just may the record reflect when
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
it comes to the sign and chief chair has
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
no Authority or discre
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
to so if there's any issues with the
 
01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
signning sheet I
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
would I'm not the person that needs that
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
correct thank you Mr chair a followup on
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
that I was just told that um you that
 
01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
each uh committee is different and you
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
have backend access or somebody does at
 
01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
least to help you and require more
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
information on the signin sheet you can
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
that need to be
 
01:28:35.310 --> 01:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
recognized I I Envision we'll have a lot
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
of C discussions in this room so it's
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
this helpful if people
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
pakus thank you Mr chairman I'd like you
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
to clarify for me what this Bill does
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from other people that if
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
open that people are getting AR RIS is
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
this what they're
 
01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:11.270 align:start position:0%
this what they're
saying

01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
so what I what I what this will do it's
 
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.830 align:start position:0%
so what I what I what this will do it's
RSA

01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:20.800 align:start position:0%

danger of serious

B and what this is do what this fill
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
would do is that by simply displaying a
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
firearm you would not be considered to
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
be engaging in Reckless contu as defined
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%

631
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
3 mere fact that you're displaying your
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
firearm which is either showing in whole
 
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
or in part or letting it be known
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
verbally that you are carrying you don't
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
even have to display you don't even
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
actually have to physically
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
show that in and of itself will not
 
01:30:06.790 --> 01:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.790 --> 01:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
up yes I I really I'm going to vote
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
against this bill because I don't think
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
anyone should be allowed to take a gun
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
out and aim it at some even if they
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
don't intend to hurt them this is bad
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
and it's not good for the future of this
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
of this state thank you represent thank
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
you I I will just say I this is my
 
01:30:45.310 --> 01:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
opinion I believe if someone were to
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
point a firearm at someone that would uh
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
go beyond the level of displ that's and
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
that would be Reckless cond because the
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes to and I'm not an expert
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
on firearm training but I know that you
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
never point the firearm at any person or
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
anything unless you intend on on
 
01:31:07.149 --> 01:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
shooting it
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
so if someone were to do that I think
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
I believe representative
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
Welch would speak to that he repres
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
case I was
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
there what is happening is when by
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
simply displaying a firearm people have
 
01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
been charged with recondo simply for
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
firearm Mr
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
chairman yes could we get some data on
 
01:32:03.109 --> 01:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
bill I don't have any data on it but I
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
believe we're in the executive session
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
so the intends to vot
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
today thank
 
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.550 align:start position:0%
today thank
you

01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%

01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
wel yeah Laura is this is to answer your
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions I know you were in the
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
committee when we did
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
this but on page
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
584 halfway down the left hand side this
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
existing statute says a person who
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
responds to a threat which would be
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
considered by a reasonable person is
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
likely to cause serious bodily injury or
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
death to the person or to another by
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
displaying a firearm or other means of
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
self-defense with the intent to W away
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
the person making the threat shall not
 
01:32:53.229 --> 01:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
have committed a criminal act under this
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
section that's the existing statute and
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
all this does is address Reckless
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
conduct on on the previous
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
par thank
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
you representative B thank you Mr
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
chairman um Mr chairman I'm definitely
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
going to support this
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh I agree there's a lot of people that
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
disagree with people open carrying but I
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
open carry all the time I go to the
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
supermarket I go to Walmart Target uh
 
01:33:25.159 --> 01:33:26.189 align:start position:0%
supermarket I go to Walmart Target uh
Home

01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
Home
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
Depot um and I did have a small incident
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh this kid you know he was 20 something
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
years old um and he was cutting across
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
Lots on my private property behind my
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
shed and and he to be honest he kind of
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
startled me when I saw him I was like oh
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
what's going on and he looks at me and
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
he says oh I'm just cutting through and
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
I said well that's what the road's for
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
you know you aren't supposed to be
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
cutting through private property so we
 
01:33:55.149 --> 01:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
had a nice
 
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
conversation but when he looked down
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
because I was open carrying that day and
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
he saw the the sidearm he goes oh hey
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
sir um I said well don't worry about it
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's an honest mistake you know just
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
don't do this you don't walk through
 
01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:08.229 align:start position:0%
don't do this you don't walk through
private

01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
property you know at that point he he
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
moved on I it was all over um but what
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
happens if it was somebody that went and
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
reported me for having my sidearm on my
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
hip as threatening which I didn't you
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
know and that's what concerns me and
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's why I support this bill because I
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to get caught up caught up in
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
anything like that um you know because
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a peaceful man I carry a gun for my
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
self- protection and my family um you
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
know I pray every day not to ever ever
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
ever use it but I want that option and
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
um you know so that's why I support the
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.639 --> 01:35:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.350 --> 01:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
see seeing no further hands raised
 
01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
computer he's wav yeah I apologize Mr
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
chair I just for the people who are
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
remote oh sorry it's my computer my
 
01:35:26.239 --> 01:35:28.030 align:start position:0%
remote oh sorry it's my computer my
apologize

01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um I think the issue
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
for me Isn't So Much carrying a weapon
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
openly and and I think we're kind of
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
confusing the issue here a little bit um
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
open carry uh for better or worse uh is
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
something that is part of our law um the
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
problem that I have is when you're
 
01:35:50.669 --> 01:35:50.679 align:start position:0%
carrying a weapon and you call attention
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
to the weapon uh for the purpose of
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
basically coercing people into some some
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
coercing a person into some type of
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
different Behavior or winning the
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
argument um I think that's that's a big
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
issue uh it's one thing to do what
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bert did which which is
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
to carry a weapon around on his own
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
property that that's fine that's
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
something you're freely allowed to do in
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh but when you call
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
attention to that for the purpose of
 
01:36:23.950 --> 01:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
changing the behavior of another person
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
and and I and I use as an example I
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
think you know we we hear a lot about
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
the defensive example of somebody who
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
might be threatening to you or somebody
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
who might be presenting a threat to you
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
but uh we're also in a situ situation or
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in a situation
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully soon where we have people
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
coming back to the legislative office
 
01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
building and testifying so you know one
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the issues is that um Firearms are
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
allowed in the legislative office
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
building and so it's perfectly possible
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
that U you know all of us could f
 
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
you know people sitting out there in the
 
01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:58.760 align:start position:0%
audience um who are opening up their
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
codes and letting us know just sort of
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
what they think of us as we sort of vote
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
up or down on certain bills and I I
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
think if you take a look at it it it at
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
the broad range of examples um I think
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
you can really sort of see the wisdom of
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
leaving the statute the way that it is
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and not passing this Bill
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
raised representa harer just a quick one
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you um I might have
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
remembered this incorrectly but I think
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
one of the testimonies we heard when the
 
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
bill was presented was a case I believe
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
it was in Manchester where a woman was
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
being attacked out in the driveway in
 
01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:53.950 align:start position:0%
being attacked out in the driveway in
the

01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
boyfriend and or husband came out and he
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
grabbed his handgun on the way down to
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
defend her and he was uh I believe
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
arrested for brandishing when he never
 
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
pointed it at anybody but he used it as
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
a tool to try
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
to protect his his loved so I think
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's what this bill is
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
attempting to do is to make sure people
 
01:38:20.709 --> 01:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
like that aren't arrested for just
 
01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:30.110 align:start position:0%

from me today I'll try and make this
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
brief um I'm not sure how many of you
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
were aware a couple months back um there
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
was a situation in
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh where we had a a large
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
displaced community that had um nowhere
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
to go a and they um made camps up at the
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
courthouse in Manchester and
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
um the state didn't did not quite know
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
how to handle the situation and there
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
was no real
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
um plan on how to execute uh a a fair
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
way to relocate people or get them the
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
proper help that they need I uh was
 
01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.149 align:start position:0%
proper help that they need I uh was
there

01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:48:27.589 --> 01:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
personally I was there every day I think
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
all but one I think I was actually in
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee or had some other state duties
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
I was there when they started to erect a
 
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
fence around this Courthouse
 
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
property um and a bunch of state police
 
01:48:47.830 --> 01:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
showed up to make sure things ran
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
smoothly now the fence was uh getting
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
thing set up at a very fast response and
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
as that was happening um the residents
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
of this area were notified that their
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
stuff um was going to be thrown away um
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
if they could not move it in time um
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
they did not wait for the fence to be
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
erected they um immediately started
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
throwing um people's possessions away
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
and um this was this situation was a
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
extremely blown out due to the pandemic
 
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
so we have seen a major increase in uh
 
01:49:34.189 --> 01:49:34.199 align:start position:0%
houseless people across the state and a
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
lot in our city areas where uh they
 
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:40.360 align:start position:0%
can't we can't afford apartments and um
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
landlords just some of them just don't
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
care and it is what it is and so getting
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
back to people congregating here all
 
01:49:54.510 --> 01:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
their worldly possessions um in one spot
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
um I remembered speaking to one of the
 
01:50:02.589 --> 01:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
women there um she had medications
 
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
social security
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
card um something from her grandmother I
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
mean I'm talking about the last worldly
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
possessions to her name and a backpack
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and while there was a couple of us um
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
there to Bear witness and try to
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
scramble and save as as much of these
 
01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
belongings for people as possible it was
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
utter chaos and there was a lack of
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
dignity given to us by the police um
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
there was at least three to four
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
officers standing near me um we spread
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
out to help each individual as much as
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
we could and I'm a 5 foot two woman I
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
don't have much upper body strength but
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
there was this cart that was really
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%
close to the people erecting this fence
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
and as these three huge very strong men
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
stood there and laughed at me I
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
scrambled to push this person's
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
possessions to safety and it was a lie
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was a tent it was a lot of a lot of
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
weight and in a shopping cart um it was
 
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
a lot and I couldn't do it and I fell
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
over and they laughed at me and they
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
said you almost got it and and you
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
better hurry and I was not treated like
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
a human being in that moment and I can
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
only imagine
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
what the people that have fallen onto
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
less fortunate circumstances must feel
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
about being treated in that position and
 
01:51:43.910 --> 01:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think that as a state I'm really
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
ashamed of how our officers acted in
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
that moment and I think there was a lack
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
of response from our state
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
and lack of resources and training our
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
officers on how to handle this situation
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
and we need to address it it's our
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do that it's just it's
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's a situation where we've put our
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
police officers in
 
01:52:12.669 --> 01:52:12.679 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a system for for them
 
01:52:15.790 --> 01:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
to be trained on so how can we expect
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
them to handle this with the dignity
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
that people deserve maybe they were
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable who knows know who can say
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
the whole experience was very
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
traumatizing for everybody involved
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
especially the people that got their
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
entire worldly possessions thrown away
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
and I just think that we need to make
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
training available we need to Showcase
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
this incident in particular for due
 
01:52:45.550 --> 01:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
process of people what if you became
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
homeless what what if you were in that
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
situation what are your rights um how do
 
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
is is it really quite necessary to throw
 
01:52:57.629 --> 01:52:57.639 align:start position:0%
away everything and incarcerate you on
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer's money when maybe there
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
should be mental health and substance
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
use um advocacy and resources for these
 
01:53:08.910 --> 01:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
people how much money are we really
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
spending by continuously incarcerating
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
the homeless and not maybe putting money
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
to another uh resource that we can
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate these people in and that's
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill is designed to do we've
 
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
heard continuous testimony in this
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
committee already from the lack of data
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
that our police officers in the state
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
gather and we are shooting ourselves in
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
the foot here by by by not studying this
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in providing dignity and morality to
 
01:53:46.069 --> 01:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
this issue which is increasing right now
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's an emergency and I
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
ask you to please take it with all due
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
consideration that it deserves
 
01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:57.470 align:start position:0%
consideration that it deserves
thank

01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%

01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%

01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you for taking my
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
question um representative if I
 
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
understood right and read the union
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
leader correctly um on the state
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
property of the courthouse uh Governor
 
01:54:19.550 --> 01:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
sonunu did offer them uh some assistance
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
in Dairy but I I don't know everything
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
but what my question
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
is is Mayor the Manchester mayor
 
01:54:32.109 --> 01:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
Craig of the man you know the Manchester
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
mayor um is she having the police the
 
01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.750 align:start position:0%
mayor um is she having the police the
Manchester

01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.470 align:start position:0%
Manchester
police

01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
police
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
studied as they went on mayor Craig's
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
first day in office down on the
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
Riverbanks and removed all of the
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
homeless off the Riverbanks and forced
 
01:54:50.669 --> 01:54:50.679 align:start position:0%
them up on Elm Street and other parts of
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
the city are they doing a you know a
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
study on the Manchester police is the
 
01:54:58.310 --> 01:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
mayor doing that I believe there's been
 
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
more uh calls for transparency on the
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester police as well and speaking
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
to this incident in particular this was
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
a State Police
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
Issue so I'm just trying to focus on
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
this this is a state issue the police in
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
question that removed the homeless and
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
threw away all their belongings were
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
state police the police that laughed and
 
01:55:21.629 --> 01:55:21.639 align:start position:0%
mocked me while I fell on the ground and
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
hurt myself for at least three weeks
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
because I've had at least two three
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
surgeries on my knee they laughed at me
 
01:55:30.709 --> 01:55:30.719 align:start position:0%
they humiliated me they treated me less
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
than human and this is something that
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken serious the whole
 
01:55:36.830 --> 01:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
state including all cities and towns so
 
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
if you're referring to an interest of
 
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
doing this at the city level too I
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative you recognize for
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:56.830 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
follow-up

01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
question if if if that happened and and
 
01:56:01.629 --> 01:56:01.639 align:start position:0%
I do believe you um you know that's
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
terrible that you know any officer would
 
01:56:06.270 --> 01:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
treat anybody especially in that
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
situation because that's got to be hired
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the homeless you
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
know you know and again I just go back
 
01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.790 align:start position:0%
know you know and again I just go back
to

01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester were you part of helping the
 
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
homeless and is
 
01:56:26.669 --> 01:56:26.679 align:start position:0%
Craig doing a study on the Manchester
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
police when they went down under the
 
01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
amamos bridge just like a week ago and
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
forced everybody out onto the street
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
again um you know I've been following uh
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
Joe Kelly Lasser and he's posting these
 
01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:41.560 align:start position:0%
pictures that are just horrific in my
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
eyes of what the mayor is instructing
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
the police and the town officials or the
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Public Works to remov
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
in these homeless people they got a live
 
01:56:56.430 --> 01:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere and is a question there yes I
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if she was part of
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
helping that yes let me try and answer
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you so much as far as I know
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
Joe Kelly Lasser has never really taken
 
01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
an interest in the homeless population
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
he's consistently worked against it and
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
if you have the time and you're
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
interested in more information on this
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
issue I suggest that you start to attend
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
some of the alderman meetings where they
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
are discussing this and they are
 
01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
gathering information and I know they're
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
doing everything in their power right
 
01:57:27.149 --> 01:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
now to get more data as far as the
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
state's concerned I think that we
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
continuously bury our heads in the sand
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
and make excuses why we can't gather
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
data and that is why I think it's a
 
01:57:37.870 --> 01:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
state responsibility and a city
 
01:57:40.069 --> 01:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I'm saying yes I agree
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
with you representative but I think we
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
also need to make sure that this is
 
01:57:46.270 --> 01:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
conducted at the city level by passing
 
01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:51.109 align:start position:0%
conducted at the city level by passing
this

01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:51.119 --> 01:57:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:57:54.430 --> 01:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
H thank you Mr chairman
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
um bringing us back to the issue of uh
 
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
of the police for just a second uh to
 
01:58:07.950 --> 01:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
what extent do you feel that it's it's a
 
01:58:11.109 --> 01:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
complicating issue uh for the police
 
01:58:13.310 --> 01:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
that a fair percentage of the people who
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
are homeless um have other problems like
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
mental health issues does that compound
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
the the situation in your
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
opinion uh yes it does what I'm most
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
concerned is that our taxpayers are
 
01:58:30.430 --> 01:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
continuously paying for people with
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use misuse
 
01:58:36.950 --> 01:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
disorders or other a whole other slew of
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
of health issues and what we're doing is
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
instead of addressing those medical
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
conditions or resources for assistance
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
on living a life that doesn't include
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
being homeless uh we
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
instead we we instead spend that money
 
01:58:55.679 --> 01:58:56.589 align:start position:0%
instead we we instead spend that money
on

01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
continuously inciting them giving them
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
um fines and then when they can't pay
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
that on compounding on top of that then
 
01:59:07.709 --> 01:59:07.719 align:start position:0%
we incarcerate them so we are literally
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
paying for this problem to keep
 
01:59:15.189 --> 01:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
happening um and in my honest opinion
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
like I said data is really important for
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
us to make
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
these good decisions on how to better
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
operate our state and and make sure that
 
01:59:28.109 --> 01:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
everybody's being treated fair and that
 
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're not just hemorrhaging our
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money on some on a system
 
01:59:37.229 --> 01:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
that's not working and and I think we
 
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
can all agree that no matter how you end
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
up homeless or displaced that you should
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
be treated with some sort of
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
dignity and I didn't see that and I'm
 
01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
talking to you from a witness that was
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
there and I had cops laugh at
 
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
Police representative test thank you Mr

question representing um you keep
 
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.030 align:start position:0%
question representing um you keep
talking

02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
about the state police as being the
 
02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:25.229 align:start position:0%
about the state police as being the
perpetrator

02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're but the
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
bill says law enforcement so I'm
 
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.320 align:start position:0%
assuming you want all kinds of law
 
02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement look at in this and also you
 
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
say the criminal justice
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
system is that
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
true yes just going back to what
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bert said this is a
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
necessary study committee to ga data so
 
02:00:55.669 --> 02:00:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're not wasting our taxpayers money
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
and we're not making lives worse it is
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
our responsibility as the criminal
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
justice Committee of the State of New
 
02:01:04.669 --> 02:01:04.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure our system is
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
working for our taxpayers and for the
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
purposes of correct Rehabilitation there
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
is a major black hole here I'm not
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
asking for us to pass anything I'm
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:24.990 align:start position:0%
 
data

02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative harer thank you Mr chair
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
question this doesn't seem to be
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
a a situation that's unique to newshire
 
02:01:38.950 --> 02:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
do you know if this has already been
 
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:41.870 align:start position:0%
do you know if this has already been
studied

02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
elsewhere when you say it's not unique
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire are you talking about
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
other states um can you please um
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
clarify uh yeah
 
02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.750 align:start position:0%
clarify uh yeah
Mr

02:01:53.750 --> 02:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
chair representer please you may clarify
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
for the witness um yes thank you Mr
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
chair um in other words the homeless
 
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
situation is not unique to New Hampshire
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
how to deal with it is also as likewise
 
02:02:13.229 --> 02:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
not unique to do you know of studies
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
that have already been done around the
 
02:02:18.910 --> 02:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
country as to how the most effective way
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with the homeless situation
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
yes um they have there's a lot of other
 
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
studies that have been done in um
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
communities with major displacement
 
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
issues and usually it's um
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
more we have to offer more resources and
 
02:02:42.510 --> 02:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
we don't do that here and I brought to
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
this argument to the floor a lot and
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
people just say well there's no proof
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
and it's a circular argument then so if
 
02:02:51.870 --> 02:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that I can't get this
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
data to prove to you that there's a need
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
then you're just not going to go for it
 
02:03:01.709 --> 02:03:01.719 align:start position:0%
but then when I try to get data you
 
02:03:03.870 --> 02:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
won't let me get data to prove that
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
there is a need so I think this is New
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific I think that we don't
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
operate just like every other state and
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
that has been made by you as well I've
 
02:03:16.510 --> 02:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
heard as your other testimony from my
 
02:03:18.030 --> 02:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues is that New Hampshire's
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
unique we need to do our own research
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to hold ourselves
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
accountable as Leaders to make sure
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
we're not wasting our taxpayers monies
 
02:03:36.030 --> 02:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
worse thank you seeing no further
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent you're excused I
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.149 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
before before we begin calling members
 
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
of the public to testify I want to
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
remind members of the public that the
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
purposes of this hearing your testimony
 
02:03:58.350 --> 02:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
is limited to one minute and one minut
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
after one minute expires you your
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.709 --> 02:04:17.719 align:start position:0%
aren hi thank you um yeah so I'll try to
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
keep this to one minute
 
02:04:23.069 --> 02:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
um I think one really important thing is
 
02:04:25.069 --> 02:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of people have a question of this
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
being a state problem versus a
 
02:04:29.790 --> 02:04:29.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester problem um I was one of the
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
protesters at the encampment occupation
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
um at 300 Chestnut Street and one thing
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
that was very clear there was that and I
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
have a fairly basic understanding of
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
this so maybe people can elaborate later
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the people who were there
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
are from all over the state because our
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
drug rehabilitation system specifically
 
02:04:54.510 --> 02:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
fun people into Manchester and creates a
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
crisis there so this is something that
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
is a Statewide issue that kind of shows
 
02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
up in these sort of specific focal
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
points um so I think study a Statewide
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
study is really warranted and another
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
thing a lot of the people that I met
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
there are really regular people and for
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of them they became houseless very
 
02:05:18.510 --> 02:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
quickly and it was very apparent to me
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
that really any of us no matter what our
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
background is
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
are much closer than we think to being
 
02:05:29.549 --> 02:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
houseless M I want SW I want to thank
 
02:05:36.990 --> 02:05:37.000 align:start position:0%

testimony seeing No Hands raised the

behalf of the New Hampshire High School
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
Democrats um the housing crisis in New
 
02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one that should concern
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
everyone and in New in November 2020 a
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
houseless encampment outside of the
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester Courthouse was raided by the
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
police department in frigid temperatures
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
people's belongings were destroyed and
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
some were forcefully removed by the
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
police housing has still not been
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
secured for them and the many other
 
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:34.280 align:start position:0%
houseless Granite Staters this
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking instance of police
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
brutality toward a group of people who
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
were trying to find a place to stay warm
 
02:06:41.709 --> 02:06:41.719 align:start position:0%
and tense while temperatures dropped to
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
freezing overnight demonstrates a clear
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
need for the establishment of this
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee to examine law enforcement and
 
02:06:50.109 --> 02:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system's response
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
to houselessness in New Hampshire
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should protect and find
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
housing for houseless people in the
 
02:06:57.549 --> 02:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
state and establishing this committee is
 
02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
an excellent first step in establishing
 
02:07:02.189 --> 02:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
a more just system no one should have to
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
worry about violence from the law
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement especially not when they are
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
in a particularly vulnerable situation
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
and trying to find a place to shelter I
 
02:07:12.589 --> 02:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
urge members of this committee to
 
02:07:16.149 --> 02:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
support HB 286 and respectfully request
 
02:07:18.069 --> 02:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
that no questions be asked afterwards
 
02:07:20.510 --> 02:07:20.520 align:start position:0%

02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
to protest the eviction of houseless
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
residents on government property it only
 
02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
took me one night in the freezing cold
 
02:08:07.109 --> 02:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
to see that we not only have a housing
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
crisis in New Hampshire but our
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
government seems IL equipped and
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
unprepared to tackle the issue when
 
02:08:15.589 --> 02:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
residents ask for mental health and
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
substance use support they are met with
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
harassment and cruelty and when
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
residents ask for housing dignity
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
and respect they are met with violence
 
02:08:28.189 --> 02:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
how can we address the problem if we
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
don't even have the lens to look at it I
 
02:08:32.270 --> 02:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
want you to imagine being in sub-degree
 
02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
weather in New Hampshire with nowhere to
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
go no warm bed to sleep in and ask
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
yourself how you would want to be
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%

Band-Aid on the problem whenever New

a resident of Manchester um I'm in
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
support of this bill over the years I've
 
02:10:35.069 --> 02:10:35.079 align:start position:0%
seen several instances of harassment of
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
homeless folks but the worst of all I've
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
seen was during the eviction at the
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
courthouse last November I wish Witness
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
police officers slashing tents throwing
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
out people's belongings and laughing
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
while they did it it was clear they took
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
joy in this activity it was not a glum
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
occasion in which they simply had to do
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
their jobs but something they reveled in
 
02:10:54.669 --> 02:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
I spoke to one resident who was still
 
02:10:56.109 --> 02:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
asleep in their tent when they began
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
slashing the tents she could have been
 
02:11:00.549 --> 02:11:00.559 align:start position:0%
injured it is abundantly clear that
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
there is a deep bias held towards the
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
homeless community and it absolutely has
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%

recognized

02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
hello um so I was uh also at the uh Camp
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh last year uh and I saw firsthand how
 
02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
the cops like uh didn't handle the
 
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
situation well at all uh it led to a lot
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
of harm against uh homeless folks uh and
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in favor of the bill
 
02:12:38.669 --> 02:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
in part because I believe uh that uh
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
more uh needs to be done about how we
 
02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
approach uh homelessness in this state I
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
know in my own hometown of Dober New
 
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our police chief has talked at
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
length about how he feels that uh the
 
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
cops are unequipped to deal with uh
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
homelessness and uh so like it's not
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
just a bunch of you know activists
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
calling for This research to be done
 
02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
cops also uh feel like they're not
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
equipped uh to handle homelessness uh in
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
the same way that more uh restorative
 
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
methods would uh allow and a commission
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
would allow uh the state to look into
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that could work not just
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
for the state level state troopers but
 
02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:30.510 align:start position:0%
for the state level state troopers but
for

02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%

Perez hi um thank you uh so my name is

Erica Perez I'm with New Hampshire youth
 
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
movement and I'm here to support um HB
 
02:14:28.030 --> 02:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
286 um I'm also one of the organizers
 
02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
who help prevent the eviction at the
 
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
encampment outside of the courthouse in
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
November um but I also personally every
 
02:14:38.549 --> 02:14:38.559 align:start position:0%
Sunday um work at a free store that
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
gives supplies directly to the houseless
 
02:14:42.669 --> 02:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
people I talk directly with them I
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
consider a lot of them my friends um
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
five of them have died since November um
 
02:14:50.589 --> 02:14:50.599 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire frankly is doing a
 
02:14:52.510 --> 02:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
horrible job we don't have a plan to
 
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
deal with our homeless population we
 
02:14:57.870 --> 02:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
treat them like pests we actively
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
incarcerate them we act we like kick
 
02:15:02.109 --> 02:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
them out of shelters they have nowhere
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
to go they're kicked off of properties
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
like there is literally no place for
 
02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
these people to go there are no real
 
02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
resources for everybody there are
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
resources that come with conditions um
 
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
and that facility that you were talking
 
02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
about representative B in Derry was um a
 
02:15:21.310 --> 02:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
sober house where you weren't even
 
02:15:24.189 --> 02:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to smoke cigarettes um but
 
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
essentially it's just a study committee
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why it's so hard to
 
02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
want to investigate something that
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
clearly needs investigating we've been
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
talking all year about racial bias
 
02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
training this is similar they are
 
02:15:39.149 --> 02:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
treated less than because they have
 
02:15:40.830 --> 02:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go there are biases that we
 
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
carry against houseless people I
 
02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
actively help houseless people and I
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
also actively have to work on my biases
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
against H's people because we have been
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
raised to be taught that they are lazy
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.549 --> 02:15:59.559 align:start position:0%
drugs M MZ your testimony is
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
expired you actually went about 30
 
02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
seconds over the committ testimony so we
 
02:16:07.390 --> 02:16:07.400 align:start position:0%
do have to

suspend representative Muse you're

recognized for a
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you thank you very
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
much um when it comes
 
02:16:18.669 --> 02:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
to when it when it comes to the
 
02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
relationship uh between how Hess people
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
and and the police I guess can you speak
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
a little more specifically to that and
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
the things that uh that you see is maybe
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
being things that a study committee
 
02:16:31.079 --> 02:16:39.629 align:start position:0%
being things that a study committee
could

02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
mute oh okay thank you sorry about that
 
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
um so for example um a lot of these
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
folks do have substance abuse issues and
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
instead um of taking them somewhere
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
where they can get help they are
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
immediately arrested if found with drugs
 
02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
um I've spoken with people who have had
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
their IDs claimed by the police and not
 
02:17:08.830 --> 02:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
given back so now that person lacks
 
02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:10.349 align:start position:0%
given back so now that person lacks
identification

02:17:10.349 --> 02:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
identification
 
02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
um they have their things
 
02:17:16.509 --> 02:17:16.519 align:start position:0%
confiscated um and it just leads them to
 
02:17:20.030 --> 02:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
have less and less um they are treated
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
like criminals because they have nowhere
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
to go um and it just creates this
 
02:17:27.349 --> 02:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
repetitive cycle of um being
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated having nothing and then
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
being incarcerated
 
02:17:41.150 --> 02:17:41.160 align:start position:0%

03848 clarify that's
 
02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:03.950 align:start position:0%
03848 clarify that's
Amendment

02:24:03.950 --> 02:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
0384 just explain what explain the
 
02:24:10.590 --> 02:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
concept of the amendment I understand
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
that if this provision were to be
 
02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
violated or Not by member of law
 
02:24:19.630 --> 02:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement although there may be a
 
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
common law
 
02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
claim there also may be issues
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
of um is whether immunity applies or not
 
02:24:33.070 --> 02:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
I think the the concern here is I
 
02:24:37.389 --> 02:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
think this expressed by repr n is it is
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
a problem when when a postest photo is
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
simply distributed without any any
 
02:24:48.429 --> 02:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
reason that can ruin someone's life um
 
02:24:49.550 --> 02:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
especially if that person is not
 
02:24:53.469 --> 02:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
convicted of CRI what the amendment does
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
is it actually creates a private right
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
of action for the person who aggravated
 
02:25:00.269 --> 02:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
by a law
 
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement's failure to comply with
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
this allow them to recover a statutory
 
02:25:08.990 --> 02:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
fee or actual
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
damages in addition to the ob I will say
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to proving your actual
 
02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
damages you have to show some type of
 
02:25:18.750 --> 02:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
loss or damage you know damage to one's
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
reputation is often hard to
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
prove of law s that SL it's hard to
 
02:25:28.309 --> 02:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
prove how you've been injured by that
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
act so this puts some teeth behind the
 
02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of it it also strikes
 
02:25:38.429 --> 02:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
one sentence from the original bill but
 
02:25:40.110 --> 02:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
the original Bill did allow the
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
photograph to be dispersed to the
 
02:25:44.309 --> 02:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
alleged victim
 
02:25:48.550 --> 02:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
in involving in the crime although I I I
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
allowing the victim to see the
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
photograph once you police dispers the
 
02:25:57.429 --> 02:25:57.439 align:start position:0%
photograph now giv the photo to the
 
02:26:00.510 --> 02:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
victim the victim could essentially then
 
02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
put that photo on social media or online
 
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
so we really that could in many
 
02:26:09.309 --> 02:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances defeat the purpose of what
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
this de I believe is trying to
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
accomplish it does not prevent the large
 
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%

02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
in addition law enforcement is limited
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
only sharing it with other state or
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
local law enforce agencies that wouldn't
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
be not allowed to provide the federal
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
government then allow them to disperse
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I I will say I I support this I
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
support this bill not pass an amendment
 
02:26:44.309 --> 02:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know a close friend of mine who I
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
grew up with was charged with a crime
 
02:26:48.510 --> 02:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
about 10 years
 
02:26:52.269 --> 02:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
ago and the reason why he was arrested
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
police were open about this that he
 
02:26:57.550 --> 02:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
simply wouldn't uh subit to a DNA
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
test well he was arrested his photograph
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
was in the front page of
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
newspaper um since that time his life is
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
not the same to this day you Google's
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
name you'll see newspaper article and
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
his mugot in the article the police were
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
very Adam and celebrated they they talk
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
their their their guy
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
which this case didn't even proceed down
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
any meaningful discovery due to lack of
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
evidence and the victim recanted the
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
allegations as well
 
02:27:36.590 --> 02:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
however it falls this day it's a very
 
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
serious charge and since that happened
 
02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
he's been unable
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
to hold the steady JW because had one
 
02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:45.150 align:start position:0%
to hold the steady JW because had one
season

02:27:45.150 --> 02:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
season
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
photo so someone who I know very well I
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
grew up with has been
 
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
suffer as a result of law enforcement
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
doings there was no public interest in
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
disclosing the
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
photo and this is unfortunate happened
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
back in the day people were in the
 
02:28:05.469 --> 02:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
courtroom you know they would have
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:13.870 --> 02:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
wrong pass that in don't that so I'll be
 
02:28:23.070 --> 02:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
we'll Now open up for
 
02:28:28.870 --> 02:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair I I have I
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
think a parliamentary inquiry uh there's
 
02:28:35.910 --> 02:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
been some confusion about the Amendments
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
I understand that your amendment is 85h
 
02:28:43.830 --> 02:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
and I believe that representative
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
Roy's amendment was 84 and the only
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
reason I mentioned the difference
 
02:28:51.070 --> 02:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
between them his had a pen yours has a
 
02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
penalty in it and his does not um is
 
02:28:57.389 --> 02:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
understanding well I believe I'm just
 
02:29:01.230 --> 02:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
basing it on I don't want to speak for
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative Roy but I recall his
 
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
testimony saying that put he didn't
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the penalty needed to be
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
put into the bill because it's a common
 
02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
law cost of action although that may be
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
a correct
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
statement I still say there may be some
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
immunity issues there assuming there's
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
not you would prove your damages in
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
order to recover I will say it's very
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to do that but this allows is
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
for it's either actual damages if you're
 
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
able to prove it or you would you would
 
02:29:35.469 --> 02:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
recover $10,000 plus your Le of that if
 
02:29:35.479 --> 02:29:38.670 align:start position:0%
recover $10,000 plus your Le of that if
you're

02:29:38.670 --> 02:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
aggravating

02:29:42.110 --> 02:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
so represent new yes just to followup so
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
we are considering your Amendment 85h
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
and your amendment has has a f a penalty
 
02:29:53.309 --> 02:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
in it is that
 
02:29:53.319 --> 02:29:56.510 align:start position:0%
in it is that
correct

02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
you so the 10,000 who is the payback is
 
02:30:08.910 --> 02:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
that something that's gonna end up
 
02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
filtering down to the
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
city the way the way the EV is written
 
02:30:18.429 --> 02:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
is the person so actually be the officer
 
02:30:20.469 --> 02:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
whe that officer is identified or not is
 
02:30:22.750 --> 02:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
a matter
 
02:30:22.760 --> 02:30:25.750 align:start position:0%
a matter
of

02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
only it's quite common that officers are
 
02:30:30.349 --> 02:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
identified but at the same time there
 
02:30:30.359 --> 02:30:32.750 align:start position:0%
identified but at the same time there
are

02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions but I will I'm just am I I'm
 
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
just say my opinion I would find it very
 
02:30:40.110 --> 02:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to actually VI you have to
 
02:30:42.910 --> 02:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
take the mugot and somehow public
 
02:30:45.630 --> 02:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
dispers of that doubt me would be
 
02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult and safe to
 
02:30:48.920 --> 02:31:02.269 align:start position:0%
very difficult and safe to
make

02:31:02.269 --> 02:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:04.830 --> 02:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
repres I don't see anything here that
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
talks to social
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
Med was that intentionally enough out of
 
02:31:14.429 --> 02:31:14.439 align:start position:0%
it because remember that's where this is
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
the whole thought of this came from
 
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
social media this personing is
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
dispersing you know whether you give it
 
02:31:23.309 --> 02:31:23.319 align:start position:0%
to a media or whether you publicize it
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
yourself on social media I think it
 
02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
would apply both any type of public
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
disclosure of the post arrest
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
photo is whether it's on Facebook
 
02:31:36.790 --> 02:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
Twitter or you give it to the the union
 
02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:38.710 align:start position:0%
Twitter or you give it to the the union
Le

02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
Le
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
does well dispersement is dispers I
 
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
don't believe it needs to say
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
specifically because then if you list
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
social media in newspaper Outlets you're
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually I could are limited know
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
they're walking around they posted you
 
02:31:57.389 --> 02:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
know on a public billboard Town Hall you
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
that would be dispers in my op you don't
 
02:32:02.950 --> 02:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily list every form
 
02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:05.349 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily list every form
dispers

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
dispers
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
something thank you representative
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
Marson thank you Mr
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
chairman I find the article three Roman
 
02:32:19.550 --> 02:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 with the $110,000 liability
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
Plus cost and legal fees whichever is
 
02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
greater but the point that there's that
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
penalty I find objectable I find that
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
I'm objecting to that part of this
 
02:32:34.269 --> 02:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
amendment respectfully Mr
 
02:32:37.510 --> 02:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think that this will cause
 
02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:39.269 align:start position:0%
chairman um I think that this will cause
people

02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
to if this would have happened file
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and it becomes a lot of that
 
02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:46.950 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and it becomes a lot of that
kind

02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
kind
 
02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
of tying up the court times ET ET Etc we
 
02:32:52.349 --> 02:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
don't even have that right now but
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
because of the $110,000
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
amendment the only my only response that
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:33:08.349 --> 02:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
is if this is a law that we
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
pass it needs it needs to be an
 
02:33:15.550 --> 02:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
enforceability side there's no penalty
 
02:33:18.750 --> 02:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
behind what's what's the benefit of the
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
law I I think we we all agree in this
 
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee is the concept of this bill is
 
02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:24.630 align:start position:0%
committee is the concept of this bill is
a

02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
great great policy but if there's no
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
consequence for viol tree falls make any
 
02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:33.670 align:start position:0%
consequence for viol tree falls make any
noise

02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
noise
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
follow thank you could the amount be
 
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
lowered to Something in in the terms of
 
02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:43.030 align:start position:0%
lowered to Something in in the terms of
even

02:33:43.030 --> 02:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.040 --> 02:33:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
$1,000

02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
$1,000
 
02:33:47.150 --> 02:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
well Beauty the beauty of our role here
 
02:33:51.950 --> 02:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
that can be a different amendment I I
 
02:33:57.630 --> 02:33:57.640 align:start position:0%
will say in basing one my
 
02:33:57.640 --> 02:33:59.309 align:start position:0%
will say in basing one my
friend

02:33:59.309 --> 02:33:59.319 align:start position:0%
friend
 
02:34:03.070 --> 02:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
anous $10,000 does not solve his
 
02:34:06.510 --> 02:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
problem I'm just this should not happen
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.790 --> 02:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
me that's just my that's just my take if
 
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
if we want if we are this policy is to
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
benefit protective to protect their
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
rights it needs to be a consequence of
 
02:34:27.070 --> 02:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
my true thank you Mr chair
 
02:34:39.150 --> 02:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
um I do have questions on on the
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
amendment but not now but a couple of
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
people have
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the the the
 
02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative abis amendment is 30
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
85 that amendment that has been offered

we're discussing is amendment
 
02:35:01.150 --> 02:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
3084 no 384 that's the yes 3085 doesn't
 
02:35:03.950 --> 02:35:03.960 align:start position:0%

that than 3084 is the one we're
 
02:35:13.200 --> 02:35:18.150 align:start position:0%
that than 3084 is the one we're
discussing

02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
correct representative right you are the
 
02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:22.309 align:start position:0%
correct representative right you are the
prime

02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
prime
 
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor am I allowed to talk about it
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
and exact yes I am
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you um
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm really conflicted I don't like who
 
02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
I want to know who's responsible for
 
02:35:40.670 --> 02:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
paying the 10,000 is it the police
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
department the police officer
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
personally um like what what is the
 
02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
procedure there and do if we're going to
 
02:35:52.349 --> 02:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
go that far and and we acknowledge that
 
02:35:54.750 --> 02:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
mistakes can happen do we want to
 
02:35:57.389 --> 02:35:57.399 align:start position:0%
include then like a first for second
 
02:35:59.870 --> 02:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
offense or like say like you know this
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
is this you didn't take this
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
serious um do we want to work on this
 
02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
more maybe have another amendment and
 
02:36:10.110 --> 02:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
pull it for right
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
now repres in response to that I will
 
02:36:16.349 --> 02:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
say if it's if this was that clearly
 
02:36:16.359 --> 02:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
say if it's if this was that clearly
inadvertent

02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
inadvertent
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
um by you know through a negligent act
 
02:36:23.070 --> 02:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
by a police
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
officer my understanding is at least at
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
the state level that offut be identified
 
02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I my understanding at the local level
 
02:36:35.389 --> 02:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's common practice that if it's a
 
02:36:38.710 --> 02:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
negligent act they would also be
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
identif followup chair if it's done
 
02:36:47.150 --> 02:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
intentionally then then that's where the
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:51.070 align:start position:0%
issue of
identification

02:36:51.070 --> 02:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
identification
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
so oh
 
02:36:56.269 --> 02:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
sorry meaning if it's an intentional
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
violation I'm
 
02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
not as clear whether you'll be identifi
 
02:37:02.790 --> 02:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
or not it's
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
simple incidentally you know they they
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
leave a
 
02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
out lost
 
02:37:12.110 --> 02:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's and this only applies again with
 
02:37:14.429 --> 02:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
people can arrest
 
02:37:18.150 --> 02:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
not I I just my concern is my taxpayers
 
02:37:20.550 --> 02:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
paying for a mistake that a police
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
officer made or a police like some one
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
bad actor you know I don't I don't think
 
02:37:30.429 --> 02:37:30.439 align:start position:0%
that's fair to my
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
constituents that's just one I want to
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:37:36.070 --> 02:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
of right I'm a huge fan ofil that you
 
02:37:38.110 --> 02:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
you put in I thank you for putting it in
 
02:37:39.630 --> 02:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure that they has
 
02:37:41.389 --> 02:37:41.399 align:start position:0%
some enforceability behind it
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
consequences it's not
 
02:37:48.429 --> 02:37:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:53.309 --> 02:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
that repr news thank you Mr chair last
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
year when we heard testimony for this
 
02:37:57.230 --> 02:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill um you know we actually heard some
 
02:37:58.990 --> 02:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
different perspectives we we heard from
 
02:38:01.150 --> 02:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
members of the news media uh who were
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
concerned I I believe we also heard uh
 
02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
from some folks uh representing police I
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
think Captain Joe Ebert from the the
 
02:38:10.830 --> 02:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
state police testified and one of the
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
things I think that he that he told us
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
so that I remember him telling us at the
 
02:38:18.670 --> 02:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
time was that um violation of this could
 
02:38:21.070 --> 02:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
also be a dis disciplinary issue that
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
would involve uh that could potentially
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
involve discipline from the police uh
 
02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
standards uh and training Council um
 
02:38:32.429 --> 02:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
like other violations uh that uh that
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
police are occas occasionally accused of
 
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
um I I guess my question is is the the
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh civil damages for someone on
 
02:38:44.910 --> 02:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
a policeman's salary seems to be very
 
02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
very high um it would also seem to be a
 
02:38:50.110 --> 02:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
motive something that would motivate me
 
02:38:53.230 --> 02:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
as a police officer to uh not mess
 
02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
around with this particular statute if I
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
knew that I could be dragged up before a
 
02:38:59.349 --> 02:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing uh and potentially
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
be suspended or maybe even lose my
 
02:39:04.590 --> 02:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
certification so I'm just wondering if
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
if uh if this is really necessary that I
 
02:39:14.349 --> 02:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
question I I
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
will I mean necessary is a strong word I
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
still think if you have any law or
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
policy that has no enforce enforcement
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism behind it I understand that
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
maybe an internal discipline dising
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
action but I I think it's critical that
 
02:39:33.269 --> 02:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
in order to deter this activity that we
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
deter other activities with penalties of
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
crime there needs to be some some
 
02:39:39.630 --> 02:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
provision here because people are
 
02:39:42.429 --> 02:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
injured and damaged by this they have
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
and they can be they were serious about
 
02:39:47.429 --> 02:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
stopping it my belief you need to have
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I'm going to
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this amendment um I think the
 
02:40:00.030 --> 02:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
penalty uh makes uh the law a little
 
02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
murky I think more important is the
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
policy and I think that if we uh include
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
the penalty into this uh Bill uh it's
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
very likely uh to uh go down in
 
02:40:18.319 --> 02:40:23.269 align:start position:0%
very likely uh to uh go down in
flames

02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:26.349 --> 02:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
representative B thank you Mr chairman
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I support the amendment
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
that's brought forward the 0384
 
02:40:36.389 --> 02:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
amendment because I like the the small
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
penalty there um because there has to be
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
deterrence you know because in my eyes
 
02:40:45.990 --> 02:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's extremely rare that I
 
02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
think they do that but you know if they
 
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
arrest somebody a charge and the person
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
being arrested is not a happy person and
 
02:40:56.830 --> 02:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
causes trouble you know I think
 
02:40:58.110 --> 02:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes they throw it out on social
 
02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
media to say okay here you go they throw
 
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
it out there um this will slow that
 
02:41:05.389 --> 02:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
behavior down because our police cannot
 
02:41:07.550 --> 02:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
be the judge and jury and this will slow
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
that down to uh to embarrass him or her
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm I'm I'm in support of it and I
 
02:41:15.830 --> 02:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't think this is going to clog the
 
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
court system you know as my friend uh
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
representative said from Manchester that
 
02:41:25.230 --> 02:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
it would and the reason I feel that is I
 
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't think this happens a lot so the
 
02:41:31.150 --> 02:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
rare times it does happen it gives the
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
person that's just being charged an
 
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
Avenue to recover some cost that he's
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
incurring uh during that time and then
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
later all the charges are probably
 
02:41:44.710 --> 02:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
dropped um thank you Mr chairman I'll be
 
02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:48.230 align:start position:0%

about to
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
pass uh I'm not quite sure of the
 
02:45:14.389 --> 02:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
procedure on this on this particular
 
02:45:19.469 --> 02:45:19.479 align:start position:0%
session um I think that we can offer a
 
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
at this point um and I would like to do
 
02:45:28.110 --> 02:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
off Mr chairman a point of
 
02:45:34.510 --> 02:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:37.309 --> 02:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
recognized point of order my point of
 
02:45:40.309 --> 02:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
order is that the last amendment to my
 
02:45:43.309 --> 02:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
best of my knowledge passed is that
 
02:45:48.469 --> 02:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
correct no no not no okay I withdraw I
 
02:45:48.479 --> 02:45:50.389 align:start position:0%
correct no no not no okay I withdraw I
withdraw

02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
that is not a point of order that is a
 
02:45:54.750 --> 02:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
question a point of order is when you're
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
questioning whether the chair of the
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee is following parliamentary
 
02:46:03.389 --> 02:46:03.399 align:start position:0%
procedure or the rules correctly if that
 
02:46:04.990 --> 02:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
is a what a point of order if you have a
 
02:46:07.710 --> 02:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
question to the chair please raise your
 
02:46:09.790 --> 02:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
hand you be you will be recognized for a
 
02:46:12.030 --> 02:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
question a point of order the chair must
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
interrupt everything that's going on and
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
recognize the point of order you're out
 
02:46:18.389 --> 02:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
of order your point of order was out of
 
02:46:18.399 --> 02:46:19.950 align:start position:0%
of order your point of order was out of
order

02:46:19.950 --> 02:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information Mr
 
02:46:23.429 --> 02:46:23.439 align:start position:0%
chairman uh in the future I'll try and
 
02:46:25.030 --> 02:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
raise it as a parliamentary inquiry I
 
02:46:25.890 --> 02:46:25.900 align:start position:0%
think that may
 
02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:41.590 align:start position:0%
think that may
[Music]

02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
be question so are you saying that we we
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
can't do another
 
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:07.400 --> 02:47:07.410 align:start position:0%
pass only Committee
 
02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:09.190 align:start position:0%
pass only Committee
[Music]

02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:47:12.030 --> 02:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
Member right and I think that's what a
 
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
a

02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:47:22.269 --> 02:47:22.279 align:start position:0%
so you're asking representative want to
 
02:47:26.429 --> 02:47:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
other I think he has a totally different
 
02:47:32.349 --> 02:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment represent bney do you have an
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that is you wish to offer
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's ready to be offer yes I
 
02:47:40.990 --> 02:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
do and is that the can you read the
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:47:45.309 --> 02:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
that uh this is amendment offered by
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative Roy um 2021 - 385 H uh I
 
02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
have forwarded a copy to uh the
 
02:47:59.070 --> 02:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee it basically
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies uh uh the process and it does
 
02:48:10.269 --> 02:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
not offer a uh a penalty you wish to off
 
02:48:14.190 --> 02:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
you wish to offer that amend yes I
 
02:48:17.429 --> 02:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
do you recognize offer the
 
02:48:21.309 --> 02:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:24.550 --> 02:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
second I'll second
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
second repres you
 
02:48:31.710 --> 02:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
seconded that's correct should speak on
 
02:48:31.720 --> 02:48:35.790 align:start position:0%
seconded that's correct should speak on
the

02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:39.389 --> 02:48:39.399 align:start position:0%
amendment um I really basically have
 
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
nothing more to offer than what
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Roy uh provided in his
 
02:48:48.269 --> 02:48:48.279 align:start position:0%
testimony um uh it is uh it does improve
 
02:48:52.429 --> 02:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
the uh bill as originally presented and
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I encourage you to adopt the
 
02:49:00.510 --> 02:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:03.429 align:start position:0%
 
amended

02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
amended
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
repres U question for the chair and
 
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm a little confused I thought
 
02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
that the only amendments that could be
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee has to be
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
coming from a Committee Member not uh
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
from a other representative outside the
 
02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee so you are correct what
 
02:49:22.229 --> 02:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
although the the
 
02:49:26.070 --> 02:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment was brought by representative
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
Roy I believe representative bour has
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
now offered the amendment so the the
 
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is still being offered by
 
02:49:34.269 --> 02:49:34.279 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee and then that was second I
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
believe that that that is an
 
02:49:43.790 --> 02:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
order I I will say it is my opinion
 
02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
better practice to have a member of the
 
02:49:47.349 --> 02:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
committee's name on the amendment but I
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's necessary
 
02:49:57.870 --> 02:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
mist my understanding I may be wrong
 
02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:11.309 --> 02:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
name name is not
 
02:50:11.319 --> 02:50:16.309 align:start position:0%
name name is not
number

02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:21.650 align:start position:0%
Red I was suggest recess this
 
02:50:21.650 --> 02:50:24.429 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:50:38.750 --> 02:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
Welch what I'll do is get clarification
 
02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:47.630 align:start position:0%
Welch what I'll do is get clarification
on

02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%

that

02:50:57.269 --> 02:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.670 --> 02:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Mr chairman in
 
02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
the 11 years I've been here uh we have
 
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
agreed as a committee that we like let's
 
02:51:11.710 --> 02:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
say if this amendment passed um I have
 
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
seen this in the past and we have agreed
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
okay we will make sure that the name is
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
changed and as long as the name is Chang
 
02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
changed um to a Committee Member we're
 
02:51:23.790 --> 02:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
going to adopt the committee or or the
 
02:51:26.229 --> 02:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
amendment or deny the amendment on
 
02:51:28.030 --> 02:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
depending on how the vote is we have
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
done that in the past to to save
 
02:51:34.030 --> 02:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
time what I'm gonna recommend we do
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
because we are running we do have a
 
02:51:38.070 --> 02:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing that we should start
 
02:51:40.269 --> 02:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
representative B while we're in that
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing though I I you do have a
 
02:51:44.190 --> 02:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
job assignment I would recommend you add
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
your name to that Amendment so we can
 
02:51:49.910 --> 02:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
make this question
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh so what I would recommend is just
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
asking legislative service to add
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's a new number or not add
 
02:51:59.630 --> 02:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
your name to that Amendment and we'll
 
02:52:03.630 --> 02:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
reopen this executive session today and
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
then also if you don't mind for the
 
02:52:08.110 --> 02:52:08.120 align:start position:0%

02:56:12.830 --> 02:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the uh the morass I
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
launched you in on the last bill with my
 
02:56:18.670 --> 02:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment but this bill um this bill
 
02:56:21.070 --> 02:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about now is
 
02:56:24.269 --> 02:56:24.279 align:start position:0%
regarding um consensual searches and I'd
 
02:56:26.469 --> 02:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
like to stop by saying this is a this is
 
02:56:29.469 --> 02:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
a conservative bill this is a liberal
 
02:56:33.070 --> 02:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill this is a Libertarian bill this is
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
a educational bill um when most of us
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
were growing up we had a class in school
 
02:56:41.510 --> 02:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
called Civics and in our civics class
 
02:56:43.950 --> 02:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
they taught you how to interact with law
 
02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:46.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement what your rights were and
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
things of this nature um I I I feel that
 
02:56:51.510 --> 02:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's not quite as uh robust as it once
 
02:56:54.710 --> 02:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
was so what this bill would do similar
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
to but different than the Miranda
 
02:56:58.990 --> 02:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
warnings police officers give this would
 
02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
be a police officer in New Hampshire if
 
02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
they were so inclined to search a
 
02:57:04.790 --> 02:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle they would ask permission to
 
02:57:06.670 --> 02:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
search the vehicle and when they do they
 
02:57:09.070 --> 02:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
would inform the citizen that they have
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
the right to decline such a search um
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
now it it may sound complicated it's
 
02:57:16.309 --> 02:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
very simple I'll walk you through an
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
example um a police officer a vehicle
 
02:57:21.070 --> 02:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
leaving an area where there's no drug
 
02:57:23.469 --> 02:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
activity um he knows the owner of the
 
02:57:25.229 --> 02:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle has a history of drug
 
02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
convictions but he doesn't see enough to
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
establish probable cause probable cause
 
02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
he would not need consent to search the
 
02:57:36.510 --> 02:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle so he does a a he follows the
 
02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle has a tail light out he speeds
 
02:57:41.190 --> 02:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
he does a a stop and addresses and
 
02:57:42.750 --> 02:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
speaks to the operator and asked the
 
02:57:44.910 --> 02:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
operator how he's doing um what you been
 
02:57:46.830 --> 02:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
up to tonight I saw you at that
 
02:57:48.910 --> 02:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
place um you have any drugs in the
 
02:57:50.150 --> 02:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle or anything I need to worry
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
about and the person would most likely
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
say no and at this point the officer say
 
02:57:56.510 --> 02:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
well then you wouldn't mindifi take a
 
02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
look would you now the average citizen
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
when they're asked that question by a
 
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
police officer feels intimidated they
 
02:58:04.830 --> 02:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
feel like well if I say no I'm G look
 
02:58:07.510 --> 02:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
guilty all the officer has to do at that
 
02:58:09.510 --> 02:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
point is to say well you don't mind if I
 
02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
take a look do you I mean you don't have
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
to let me look you have the right not to
 
02:58:16.510 --> 02:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
but that's all that's all we're asking
 
02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
that they inform the citizen that they
 
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
have a right to decline the search um so
 
02:58:22.830 --> 02:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
as I said at the beginning this is an
 
02:58:26.469 --> 02:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
education bill um Civics all we're doing
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
is making the police let people know
 
02:58:31.269 --> 02:58:31.279 align:start position:0%
they have the right to refuse the
 
02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
search and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.229 --> 02:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:58:44.550 --> 02:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:58:46.389 --> 02:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
representative Roy for taking my
 
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
question in the case that you just
 
02:58:52.030 --> 02:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
described where the citizen um where the
 
02:58:55.150 --> 02:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
police officer if he did have probable
 
02:58:57.630 --> 02:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
enough to establish probable
 
02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
cause how would that how would that
 
02:59:02.309 --> 02:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
transaction transpire
 
02:59:03.950 --> 02:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
differently oh thank you for the
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
question representative police officer
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
has probable cause to search a vehicle
 
02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
um or a person he can stop he can
 
02:59:13.750 --> 02:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
effectuate the Stop and he he's allowed
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
with probable cause for for a vehicle
 
02:59:19.630 --> 02:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
there's two ways it can go um and and
 
02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
again I've been out of the out of the uh
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
out of the game for quite some time but
 
02:59:25.429 --> 02:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
my recollection is because a vehicle is
 
02:59:27.349 --> 02:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
high inherently mobile and evidence
 
02:59:30.269 --> 02:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
could be moved the op officer can search
 
02:59:32.190 --> 02:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
the vehicle using probable cause that he
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
can articulate he has or he can seize
 
02:59:36.910 --> 02:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
the vehicle until he can obtain a search
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
warrant from a
 
02:59:40.910 --> 02:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
judge um so let's say in that situation
 
02:59:42.389 --> 02:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
he went with a search warrant option he
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
has probable cause he could seize the
 
02:59:46.150 --> 02:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle remove the operator from the
 
02:59:47.790 --> 02:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle the operator of course is free
 
02:59:51.990 --> 02:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
to leave unless he's seized as well um
 
02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
and the ve they would obtain a search
 
02:59:56.110 --> 02:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
warrant and search the vehicle or he
 
02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
could use probable cause to search a
 
03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
warrantless search of the vehicle um
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
many departments May opt for the the uh
 
03:00:06.190 --> 03:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
the warrant aspect it just depends on
 
03:00:06.200 --> 03:00:11.150 align:start position:0%
the warrant aspect it just depends on
the

03:00:11.150 --> 03:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
situation do
 
03:00:16.349 --> 03:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
it just quick followup so then I mean
 
03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about giving information
 
03:00:20.269 --> 03:00:20.279 align:start position:0%
to the citizen he probably would tell
 
03:00:22.269 --> 03:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
would tell him that at the point that he
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
is taking whatever action he takes it is
 
03:00:27.269 --> 03:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
not consensual because people by then
 
03:00:29.309 --> 03:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
would everyone would know based on this
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
law that you have the right to refuse
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
non consensual
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
sirar is that correct um I I would say
 
03:00:41.070 --> 03:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
in my experience no um it would not be
 
03:00:43.950 --> 03:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
correct um you'd be shocked at how many
 
03:00:46.269 --> 03:00:46.279 align:start position:0%
people um tell you now that you can
 
03:00:47.630 --> 03:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
search the car even though they don't
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
they AR warned that they have a right
 
03:00:53.150 --> 03:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
not to um people know there's drugs in
 
03:00:54.429 --> 03:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
the car know the police are going to
 
03:00:57.110 --> 03:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
search it and the police off officer
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
asks MCH your vehicle even though he
 
03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
didn't say you have a right to say no
 
03:01:06.190 --> 03:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
implied in the question may I search is
 
03:01:07.950 --> 03:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh is the ability to say no to that
 
03:01:10.630 --> 03:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
search but they say yes anyway hoping
 
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
that if they say yes the search won't
 
03:01:14.510 --> 03:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
happen or the police officer won't find
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
it um what have you so I I would say
 
03:01:19.870 --> 03:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
know that most people still will not say
 
03:01:22.750 --> 03:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
no most people don't I mean you can say
 
03:01:25.309 --> 03:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
no to a field sobriety test but people
 
03:01:27.389 --> 03:01:27.399 align:start position:0%
take it anyway knowing they're going to
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
fail because they feel like if they say
 
03:01:31.150 --> 03:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
no it makes them look guilty it's it's
 
03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
an interesting uh study in in
 
03:01:36.590 --> 03:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
Psychology thank
 
03:01:40.150 --> 03:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:01:48.910 --> 03:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:01:52.190 --> 03:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
represent I mean sorry representative
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
news thank you um I just had one
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
question I I know that this bill has
 
03:01:59.269 --> 03:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
been compared in some ways uh to the
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
Miranda warning um and the language for
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
the Miranda warning is is fairly uh
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
fairly formal um I'm not a police
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
officer but it seems like every police
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
drama I've ever seen on TV uh they say
 
03:02:14.349 --> 03:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
it pretty much the same way and and I'm
 
03:02:16.750 --> 03:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
curious if you think that there there
 
03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
may be some room for some ambiguity or
 
03:02:18.840 --> 03:02:19.790 align:start position:0%
may be some room for some ambiguity or
for

03:02:19.790 --> 03:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:02:24.070 --> 03:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation if this uh isn't
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
communicated uh to people in a way that
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
maybe is a little more standard and
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
formal thank you for the question
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative M and it's possible that
 
03:02:36.750 --> 03:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the difference between Miranda and
 
03:02:38.670 --> 03:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
Nessa is a couple things Miranda
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
requires in uh custodial interrogation
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
that means that the person has to be in
 
03:02:45.870 --> 03:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
custody so a lot of clever police
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
officers will conduct investigations in
 
03:02:48.990 --> 03:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
a public public place so the person can
 
03:02:50.910 --> 03:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
never claim their in custody and don't
 
03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
require the Miranda warnings the Miranda
 
03:02:55.510 --> 03:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
warnings themselves um came from the
 
03:02:58.710 --> 03:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um and they said what had
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be had to be um had to be said and
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
implied in the warnings this coming from
 
03:03:07.630 --> 03:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature is a lot different um so
 
03:03:09.910 --> 03:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
we we're free to to say you know we C we
 
03:03:11.550 --> 03:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
could spell out exactly what they have
 
03:03:14.110 --> 03:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
to say we could create a form they have
 
03:03:16.309 --> 03:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
to use but I don't want to hamstring the
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
police entirely because a lot of good
 
03:03:20.870 --> 03:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
police work does come from gut instincts
 
03:03:22.910 --> 03:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
and them being able to ask a citizen do
 
03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
you mind if I search and them saying no
 
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think so or you know as
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
long as the police officer tells them
 
03:03:32.469 --> 03:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
they don't have to I think that we've
 
03:03:34.349 --> 03:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
we've sered Our obligation to our
 
03:03:35.790 --> 03:03:35.800 align:start position:0%
citizens while at the same time not
 
03:03:37.229 --> 03:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
hamstering our police officers from
 
03:03:40.429 --> 03:03:40.439 align:start position:0%
being able to do good investigative
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:03:52.510 --> 03:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative green thank you Mr
 
03:03:58.229 --> 03:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you m representative Roy
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
if the person consented to have their
 
03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:01.990 align:start position:0%
if the person consented to have their
car

03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
car
 
03:04:05.309 --> 03:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
inspected uh how far would the officer
 
03:04:08.229 --> 03:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
go uh before he started dismantling
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
everything in the
 
03:04:13.389 --> 03:04:13.399 align:start position:0%
car um that's a good question I would I
 
03:04:17.309 --> 03:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
would suggest um based on common sense a
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
road deid stop a consensual search isn't
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to get into taking taking um
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
taking apart the vehicle um they
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the ability the tools or
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
whatever to do that um again there there
 
03:04:35.429 --> 03:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
is some some ambiguity net the citizens
 
03:04:37.790 --> 03:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
free to stop the search at any time and
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
say you know what I withdraw my consent
 
03:04:40.349 --> 03:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
when they start pulling the seat
 
03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
cushions off if if that's the issue um
 
03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
it it's really between the citizen and
 
03:04:49.469 --> 03:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
the uh police officer how far that the
 
03:04:51.750 --> 03:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
citizens W willing to let it
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:01.309 --> 03:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
you represent thank you for your
 
03:05:04.030 --> 03:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair uh would ask a
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
question of the witness and I want to
 
03:05:07.870 --> 03:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
thank you in advance for taking my
 
03:05:12.190 --> 03:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
question I I I I support the concept of
 
03:05:15.469 --> 03:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
this bill what I what I would ask in a
 
03:05:17.229 --> 03:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
circumstance where an officer fails to
 
03:05:19.229 --> 03:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
comply with the
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of this of this bill of
 
03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:24.670 align:start position:0%
requirements of this of this bill of
this

03:05:24.670 --> 03:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
law would you support an amendment that
 
03:05:29.389 --> 03:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
would make basically as a matter of law
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
make that search be done without consent
 
03:05:32.640 --> 03:05:35.510 align:start position:0%
make that search be done without consent
unconsented

03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:38.309 --> 03:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
search I would I just I would be
 
03:05:40.389 --> 03:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
interested in the mechanism you would
 
03:05:42.590 --> 03:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
use to do that I mean currently there
 
03:05:44.510 --> 03:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
are consensual searches happening all
 
03:05:48.150 --> 03:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
around the country and questions of
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
credibility as you well know come up in
 
03:05:52.990 --> 03:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
court as to if a if a citizen says hey I
 
03:05:54.429 --> 03:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
did not consent to that search and the
 
03:05:56.389 --> 03:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
police officer say yes I did it comes
 
03:05:58.750 --> 03:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
down to a question of credibility I I
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
would think the only way to alleviate
 
03:06:03.429 --> 03:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
that would be some type of a assigned
 
03:06:06.429 --> 03:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
document to allow the search the only
 
03:06:08.229 --> 03:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
concern I have with that is once you get
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
people signing things um it it it raises
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
the bar so high that most people are are
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to you're going to
 
03:06:18.429 --> 03:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
hamstring the police from the ability to
 
03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
to use this consensual Search tool um
 
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
once you start producing documents to be
 
03:06:26.269 --> 03:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
signed it's kind of like the um it's
 
03:06:27.190 --> 03:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
kind of like with the with the
 
03:06:29.070 --> 03:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
breathalizer you know when you get to
 
03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
that part portion of it and it it gets
 
03:06:34.830 --> 03:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
it gets a it gets official that's when
 
03:06:36.429 --> 03:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
you get more refusals than you do for
 
03:06:38.590 --> 03:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
field sobriety test for example and a
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
citizen can refuse both of those but
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
generally they take the field sobriety
 
03:06:44.190 --> 03:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
test but the breath liiz is where
 
03:06:46.309 --> 03:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll suddenly wake up and
 
03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
realize what's happening so I I'm trying
 
03:06:51.229 --> 03:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
to walk as fine a line as possible by
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
not hamstringing the police but yet
 
03:06:55.630 --> 03:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
notifying them so I mean I would be open
 
03:06:56.870 --> 03:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
to any
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment um short of making something
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
where the citizens had to sign
 
03:07:02.830 --> 03:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
permission because I feel like that
 
03:07:05.070 --> 03:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
would definitely complicate the police
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
more my question representative
 
03:07:16.229 --> 03:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
n thank you chair thanks for taking my
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
question representative do you think
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
based off of what you just said we're
 
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
discussing how to prove if your rights
 
03:07:27.790 --> 03:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
have actually been given to you do you
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
think in this instance it would be
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial for our state to have body
 
03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
cams on our police
 
03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
officers um well I I'm not sure how how
 
03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
gerain it is to to the bill but yes I've
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
always been a proponent of body camps
 
03:07:44.990 --> 03:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
they they're good for the police and for
 
03:07:48.229 --> 03:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
the citizens um but yeah yeah I I
 
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
definitely would think that it would be
 
03:07:51.950 --> 03:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
helpful because that would take away any
 
03:07:54.190 --> 03:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
questions of whether or not consent was
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
given or not
 
03:08:01.550 --> 03:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:08.309 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

03:08:08.309 --> 03:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:08:08.319 --> 03:08:10.510 align:start position:0%
question
representative

03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:08:13.550 --> 03:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't quite understand uh I know
 
03:08:15.309 --> 03:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about things that don't
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
exist yet but you I think you said you
 
03:08:21.950 --> 03:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
were against having the the police have
 
03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
the uh people sign a form because it
 
03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
might hamstring the police but isn't the
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of your bill to make sure
 
03:08:37.229 --> 03:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
people are fully informed that that they
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
do not have to allow the police to
 
03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
search their their
 
03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
guard than super question representative
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
Tru and and and I agree that there is um
 
03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
there there is some inherent conflict in
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
the two I mean I guess I would say that
 
03:08:57.269 --> 03:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know we we could also say that they
 
03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
have a right to an attorney before they
 
03:09:01.870 --> 03:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
speak to police officer at all and I'm
 
03:09:03.229 --> 03:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
sure the chairman would tell you that
 
03:09:04.830 --> 03:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
they would say don't talk to them about
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
anything so we have to make an
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
assumption that that citizens are are
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
once they've been warned they don't have
 
03:09:15.550 --> 03:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
to submit to the search are are wise
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
enough to make their own decision um
 
03:09:19.550 --> 03:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not they wish to go further
 
03:09:22.190 --> 03:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
with that um
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
but as with Miranda um I don't I'm not
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
sure it's required but a lot of places
 
03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
use a Miranda card where they ask the
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
the person to sign their rights um and
 
03:09:34.510 --> 03:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
it's in a much more solemn and
 
03:09:36.750 --> 03:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
controlled setting on the side of a
 
03:09:39.229 --> 03:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
highway at nighttime asking someone to
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
sign a document um I I just feel it gets
 
03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
very complicated it it
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
um you could almost get into whether or
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
not you know was he did he feel like he
 
03:09:52.349 --> 03:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
had to sign the document so he could
 
03:09:54.830 --> 03:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
leave so then the document has to have a
 
03:09:56.389 --> 03:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
warning that you don't have to sign this
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
document it just it creates a whole
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
legal legal morass that we could get
 
03:10:03.070 --> 03:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
pulled into um while it get decided in
 
03:10:05.030 --> 03:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the court whereas if we simply say the
 
03:10:06.630 --> 03:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
police officer has to verbally warn the
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
person they have a right to refuse the
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
search um I think it it's much less um
 
03:10:15.110 --> 03:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
complicated but I do agree with you
 
03:10:17.030 --> 03:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative truid when balancing
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
rights like this it's a it's often a
 
03:10:22.990 --> 03:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:31.309 --> 03:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
you seeing No Hands raised I want to
 
03:10:33.309 --> 03:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:46.239 --> 03:10:48.309 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:10:48.309 --> 03:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:10:57.510 --> 03:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.429 --> 03:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
chairman whoops I'm in the wrong screen
 
03:11:03.790 --> 03:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
sorry uh can people hear me now and
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
Professor we we're limiting testimony to
 
03:11:08.670 --> 03:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
two minutes per per witness I'm just
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
going to get wound up at two minute time
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
but uh I I will abide by that thank you
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair um my name's Albert Sher
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
often known as was um I've been a a
 
03:11:24.229 --> 03:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
professor at UNH law for 27 or 28 years
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
prior to that uh I was a public defender
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for 30 years so I've
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
been involved in the criminal justice
 
03:11:32.830 --> 03:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
system in New Hampshire for about 40
 
03:11:35.830 --> 03:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
years now I teach in the area relevant
 
03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
to this uh uh uh HB 485 I teach in the
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
area of criminal procedure which this
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
directly involves um let me make uh and
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
one more thing uh the opinions I
 
03:11:50.349 --> 03:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
expressed today are my opinions and not
 
03:11:54.110 --> 03:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
the opinions of unh law or UNH proper U
 
03:11:56.190 --> 03:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
so this is what I would call Miranda
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
light uh it doesn't have the intense
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
formality that uh Miranda does uh given
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
the circumstances though stressful for
 
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
for example the driver of a car very
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
stressful it it it's not compared to the
 
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
stress that one under goes when one is
 
03:12:16.150 --> 03:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
undergoing con uh custodial
 
03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
interrogation the import it's important
 
03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
to understand this bill does not create
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
any new rights the right to refuse to
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
consent to a search is you have that
 
03:12:29.550 --> 03:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional right all this bill does
 
03:12:33.309 --> 03:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
is notify the uh the individual that
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
they have that right uh I think the huge
 
03:12:37.150 --> 03:12:37.160 align:start position:0%
majority of individuals don't know they
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
have that right uh I think uh
 
03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative Roy is right that most
 
03:12:43.630 --> 03:12:43.640 align:start position:0%
people will still go ahead and consent
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
there's a study done as my written
 
03:12:49.269 --> 03:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
testimony reflects that a a a a mock you
 
03:12:49.279 --> 03:12:50.429 align:start position:0%
testimony reflects that a a a a mock you
know

03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
situation uh unfortunately by academics
 
03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't hold that against the study uh but
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
they they tried out uh whether people
 
03:13:01.710 --> 03:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
would be more inclined to refuse to
 
03:13:03.550 --> 03:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
consent if they were told they had the
 
03:13:05.950 --> 03:13:05.960 align:start position:0%
right to consent and the studies s found
 
03:13:07.710 --> 03:13:07.720 align:start position:0%
no difference in the rate at which
 
03:13:09.710 --> 03:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
people refused to consent more
 
03:13:12.630 --> 03:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentally Miranda itself a study was
 
03:13:15.990 --> 03:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
done in 1999 that showed that after
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
people are read their their Miranda
 
03:13:20.309 --> 03:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
rights almost 90% of them wave their
 
03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
Miranda rights so this is not going to
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
be a big
 
03:13:26.229 --> 03:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
imposition uh there are six states
 
03:13:29.950 --> 03:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
currently who have either by Court uh uh
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
Court decision or by Statute have a
 
03:13:35.349 --> 03:13:35.359 align:start position:0%
provision similar to this uh there are
 
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
any number of municipalities in North
 
03:13:41.110 --> 03:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
Carolina uh in Kentucky the state of
 
03:13:43.870 --> 03:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
Mississippi the state of Arkansas uh
 
03:13:46.269 --> 03:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
their Supreme Courts have both found
 
03:13:47.830 --> 03:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
that there is a right that they have to
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
be told that there's a right to refuse
 
03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
the uh the town of Wentworth New
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has in their consent search
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
form uh language that says you have a
 
03:14:01.229 --> 03:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
right to refuse
 
03:14:05.750 --> 03:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
here you go 4 25 seconds over the time
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
Li I will uh silence myself and uh
 
03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that anyone
 
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
has you got lucky Mr she thank you
 
03:14:17.349 --> 03:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
fortunately I'm remote so you can't
 
03:14:19.670 --> 03:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
physically punish
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
me representative G Rec for a question
 
03:14:24.910 --> 03:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
my question um you said there's a town
 
03:14:29.229 --> 03:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
that they actually have a
 
03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
form that yeah um most uh thank you for
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
your question representative G most uh
 
03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
most towns in virtually every town in
 
03:14:40.670 --> 03:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a consent to search
 
03:14:45.309 --> 03:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
form um uh so it's not unusual that the
 
03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
a town has a form that has a consent to
 
03:14:50.070 --> 03:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
search on it
 
03:14:53.469 --> 03:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
uh many of them do not include a right
 
03:14:56.710 --> 03:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
to refuse to consent in that form but
 
03:14:58.590 --> 03:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
that the town of Wentworth New Hampshire
 
03:15:02.110 --> 03:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
does um and uh the the Bureau of Highway
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
Patrol enforcement in New Hampshire uh
 
03:15:07.070 --> 03:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
they also inform individuals of their
 
03:15:10.030 --> 03:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
right to refuse so uh it's not going to
 
03:15:13.309 --> 03:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
be a big change for police departments
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and in fact well I'll
 
03:15:18.910 --> 03:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
leave it at that
 
03:15:20.990 --> 03:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
represent G recognize for a follow off
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
question okay so is this form something
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
that um the person that stopped signs or
 
03:15:30.550 --> 03:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
or it's just read to them
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
and it depends on the police
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
department um but you know the the the
 
03:15:38.550 --> 03:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office law
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement manual makes it clear that
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
although not required at this point to
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
inform somebody of their right to refuse
 
03:15:48.990 --> 03:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh let me read what they say in the law
 
03:15:51.550 --> 03:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement manual police officers are
 
03:15:53.790 --> 03:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
not obligated to inform people that they
 
03:15:56.550 --> 03:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a right to refuse consent however
 
03:15:58.269 --> 03:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
stated that it is good policy to do so
 
03:16:03.550 --> 03:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
and in some situations such as a knock
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
and talk procedure the court is
 
03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
considered requiring it as a
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
prerequisite to valid consent that a
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
person was informed of the right to
 
03:16:15.550 --> 03:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
refuse before giving consent would be an
 
03:16:18.349 --> 03:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
important factor in in a favor of a
 
03:16:19.950 --> 03:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
finding of
 
03:16:23.630 --> 03:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
voluntariness so the you know the the
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
more documentation the the better um I
 
03:16:29.630 --> 03:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate Representatives Roy's
 
03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
comments um about uh documentation being
 
03:16:35.910 --> 03:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps being an impediment and I
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
understand that but certainly the the
 
03:16:40.389 --> 03:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's law enforcement man
 
03:16:44.110 --> 03:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
manual is very encouraging if police uh
 
03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
of of informing people of their right to
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
refuse and you know it would not be a
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
big burden on any Police Department to
 
03:16:54.710 --> 03:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
change uh to create a form or to change
 
03:17:06.870 --> 03:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:11.070 --> 03:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
refuse see seeing No Hands
 
03:17:14.469 --> 03:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
raised WIC I thank you your
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%

Joseph
 
03:17:27.189 --> 03:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
Eber now just as a reminder your
 
03:17:30.510 --> 03:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
minutes hi good afternoon everyone my
 
03:17:36.189 --> 03:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Ebert it's EBT I'm a captain
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire State Police
 
03:17:39.269 --> 03:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
overseeing the Investigative Services
 
03:17:43.389 --> 03:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
Bureau um so uh today I I did want to uh
 
03:17:46.349 --> 03:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
recognize um the testimony that I
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
listened to from representative Roy I
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
think this is a very reasonable Bill uh
 
03:17:53.790 --> 03:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
to to make that notification to persons
 
03:17:57.389 --> 03:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
uh is something that the state police uh
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
would encourage and and would support uh
 
03:18:01.750 --> 03:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
there is one portion of the bill that I
 
03:18:03.790 --> 03:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
had concern with uh that the division of
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
State Police had concerned with as we
 
03:18:08.389 --> 03:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
reviewed it and that is the um uh
 
03:18:11.189 --> 03:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
section that talks about omitting uh
 
03:18:14.630 --> 03:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the person refused a consent search
 
03:18:16.830 --> 03:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
within an affidavit that's submitted
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
later for um for a search warrant so the
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
concern we have there is one really just
 
03:18:28.950 --> 03:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
of uh uh more procedure than anything I
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand what the representative or I
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
think I understand what the
 
03:18:33.150 --> 03:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative was getting at there that
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be used as a basis to build
 
03:18:38.070 --> 03:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh probable cause however it is a fact
 
03:18:39.870 --> 03:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
that U took place and I would be
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
concerned if we were omitting any facts
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh as we were submitting an affidavit to
 
03:18:47.070 --> 03:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
the uh to the judge I think it's
 
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon the judge to uh give
 
03:18:51.630 --> 03:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
weight to that whatever fact is laid
 
03:18:53.550 --> 03:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
before them uh so that's that's really
 
03:18:55.910 --> 03:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
the only issue that uh that we had that
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
we wanted to bring to the um to the
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
conscience of the committee and and with
 
03:19:03.030 --> 03:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:19:06.650 --> 03:19:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:06.660 --> 03:19:11.750 align:start position:0%

Association of criminal defense lawyers
 
03:19:52.189 --> 03:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill I've practiced

uh criminal defense law in New Hampshire
 
03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:58.120 align:start position:0%

Franklin Pierce School of Law the
 
03:20:06.429 --> 03:20:06.439 align:start position:0%
statements I make today are in my own
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
capacity and and not representative of
 
03:20:11.950 --> 03:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
the UNH law school or un itself but I am
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
speaking for the NHC CDL board um you
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
know I do agree with that with what
 
03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
others have said today and that
 
03:20:20.550 --> 03:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
essentially this um Bill does not change
 
03:20:23.309 --> 03:20:23.319 align:start position:0%
the law it does not um you know give
 
03:20:25.110 --> 03:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
anyone more rights than they already
 
03:20:27.070 --> 03:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
have it simply informs them of the
 
03:20:29.150 --> 03:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
rights that they have um and lets them
 
03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
know that um should they choose to
 
03:20:34.830 --> 03:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
exercise those rights um that they will
 
03:20:36.910 --> 03:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
that that the choice to exercise those
 
03:20:39.070 --> 03:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
rights is not going to be used against
 
03:20:41.670 --> 03:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
them um you know I did submit written
 
03:20:43.950 --> 03:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
testimony on this in my experience is
 
03:20:46.189 --> 03:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
that you know anyone um in this
 
03:20:50.429 --> 03:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
situation you me um anyone uh who is
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
pulled over on the side of the road and
 
03:20:54.389 --> 03:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
you confronting a police officer um who
 
03:20:56.110 --> 03:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
was perhaps looking into whether or not
 
03:20:58.510 --> 03:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
they did something wrong um is put in a
 
03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
position of sort of um being kind of
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
under the microscope under under sort of
 
03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
the gun at that point to feel that you
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
know they need to you know cooperate and
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
comply otherwise um you know something
 
03:21:12.030 --> 03:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
bad might happen to them and that
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
includes making the choice to exercise
 
03:21:16.269 --> 03:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
their rights but you know this bill
 
03:21:18.510 --> 03:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
would interrupt that and tell them that
 
03:21:21.189 --> 03:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know if they were uh that one it
 
03:21:22.990 --> 03:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
would inform them of their right and two
 
03:21:24.630 --> 03:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
it would tell them that you know if they
 
03:21:26.750 --> 03:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
um chose to exercise that right that it
 
03:21:29.910 --> 03:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
would not be um used against them and
 
03:21:32.469 --> 03:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
would allow them to make a free choice
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
in that moment um you know I think right
 
03:21:37.349 --> 03:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
now I can tell you I think someone
 
03:21:39.070 --> 03:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
raised a question earlier about you know
 
03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
Miranda rights and obviously that is a
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
more formal process but once advised of
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
those rights given the opportunity to um
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
review them think about them I would say
 
03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know it is most um lawyers would
 
03:21:54.710 --> 03:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
tell you that the majority of people are
 
03:21:56.269 --> 03:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
signing you know they're making these
 
03:21:58.269 --> 03:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
choices but they're doing it in this
 
03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
moment that is you know kind of free
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
from uh kind of the pressure of
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
answering you know in that moment and
 
03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
instead being able to reflect upon their
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
rights um as read to them um being advis
 
03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
that they have agency and choice in that
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
moment um I think it it would probably
 
03:22:17.189 --> 03:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
result in a similar situation on the
 
03:22:20.229 --> 03:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
side of the road um with these drivers
 
03:22:22.110 --> 03:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
but what this would do is change the
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
nature into the of that encounter into
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
one where the individual you know can
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
make an informed choice and you know
 
03:22:31.670 --> 03:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
should they refuse to grant that consent
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
the officer is still free to use the
 
03:22:37.550 --> 03:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
evidence that he had attorney Davis we
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
do have limit t two minutes you almost
 
03:22:44.469 --> 03:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
minutes so I apologize sorry I wasn't
 
03:22:49.510 --> 03:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
with the stopwatch but thank you for
 
03:22:53.349 --> 03:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
letting me know it's so problem the CH I
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
want thank you for your testimony I I do
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
also have a question I would thank you
 
03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
in advance for taking my
 
03:23:05.150 --> 03:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
question I guess I I support the policy
 
03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:06.229 align:start position:0%
question I guess I I support the policy
that

03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
hb45 was
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
created what I what I'm wondering is in
 
03:23:14.910 --> 03:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
a circumstance where an officer didn't
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
comply with the uh this poliy that would
 
03:23:21.150 --> 03:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
be they didn't advise an individual of
 
03:23:21.160 --> 03:23:21.950 align:start position:0%
be they didn't advise an individual of
their

03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
right um to not that they don't have to
 
03:23:25.950 --> 03:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
consent of
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
search what what would be the
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
consequence of that search I understand
 
03:23:33.150 --> 03:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
if assuming there was no other cost
 
03:23:35.550 --> 03:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
basis for
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
search so you're saying that if if the
 
03:23:40.750 --> 03:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
officer failed to abide by this law
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
should it go into effect and so failed
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
to uh advise an individual of their
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
right to refuse used to consent what
 
03:23:50.469 --> 03:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
would the consequence be
 
03:23:53.590 --> 03:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
yes I think under the bill is
 
03:23:56.110 --> 03:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
is currently written I don't think
 
03:23:58.750 --> 03:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's anything in in this bill itself
 
03:24:02.189 --> 03:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
that um gives consequence to that I
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
think in the courtroom um the argument
 
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
over whether or not consent was
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
voluntarily given at that point would
 
03:24:13.870 --> 03:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
begin and um you know it it would sort
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
of uh fall to I think the uh parties to
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
argue whether that consent was freely
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
given in that moment um and what the
 
03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.120 --> 03:24:35.830 align:start position:0%
 
encounter

03:24:35.830 --> 03:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.790 --> 03:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
than seeing No Hands
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:45.319 --> 03:25:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:25:00.070 --> 03:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.269 --> 03:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
can you can you hear
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
me we uh although it's me really it's a
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
reminder myself that the test two
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
minutes but the last two witnesses went
 
03:25:12.349 --> 03:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
over too so I will allow you two and a
 
03:25:14.950 --> 03:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
half minutes thank you thank you chair I
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um thank you chair and
 
03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee for taking my testimony my
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
name is Joseph laskas I am testifying
 
03:25:24.189 --> 03:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the American civil
 
03:25:26.750 --> 03:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
liberties Union of New Hampshire and we
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
are in support of this
 
03:25:31.630 --> 03:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
legislation um the first thing that I
 
03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to start off uh saying about
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is that this bill is not going
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
to create a new right um all it does is
 
03:25:41.309 --> 03:25:41.319 align:start position:0%
just requires that police officers
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
inform individuals of a pre-existing
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
right and it's it's funny because when I
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
first heard about this bill I did a
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
quick poll of um the individuals I knew
 
03:25:54.590 --> 03:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not they they knew that they
 
03:25:57.790 --> 03:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
had the right to uh to refuse a search
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
and they did not most people did not
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
know and I you know I don't know you
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
know the majority of New Hampshire but
 
03:26:05.070 --> 03:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
you know pretty much everyone I knew
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know this and the the other thing
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
is that individuals uh one person
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
responded to me that they had a
 
03:26:16.670 --> 03:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
situation where um they were pulled over
 
03:26:19.229 --> 03:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
and the the police officer thought that
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
they were doing something wrong and and
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
told them you know well if you have
 
03:26:23.830 --> 03:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to hide then then you should let
 
03:26:27.670 --> 03:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
me search your car your vehicle and they
 
03:26:29.469 --> 03:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
did because they felt like I need to
 
03:26:31.469 --> 03:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
prove that I have nothing to hide and
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
that um I I I think that's the problem
 
03:26:36.030 --> 03:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill is is aimed at
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
correcting is just making sure that
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
individuals are informed about their
 
03:26:42.670 --> 03:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
rights and that they are making an
 
03:26:46.189 --> 03:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
informed um decision and and like repres
 
03:26:47.309 --> 03:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
represenative Roy said I don't think it
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
could have been said better this is
 
03:26:50.469 --> 03:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
really just about Civics here this is
 
03:26:52.670 --> 03:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
about just making sure that people know
 
03:26:55.070 --> 03:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
their right here in the grit state that
 
03:26:57.550 --> 03:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
they have a um you know that that
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
informed consent and that they're giving
 
03:27:01.750 --> 03:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
it and that they have a positive
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
interaction with law enforcement so it's
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
for these reasons and those that have
 
03:27:08.429 --> 03:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
been stated before um that we strongly
 
03:27:10.030 --> 03:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and hope that
 
03:27:12.030 --> 03:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
this committee votes ought to pass on
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
this I am happy to take any questions
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:21.670 --> 03:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
under two and a half minutes I would say
 
03:27:26.349 --> 03:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.710 --> 03:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
seconds 30
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
seconds representative true thank you Mr
 
03:27:34.550 --> 03:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:27:37.550 --> 03:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
um realizing that if if it's uh if the
 
03:27:41.510 --> 03:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
officer has a probable cause none of
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
this matters but the way the bill is
 
03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
written do you see any with it just
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
falling back to he said she said the
 
03:27:52.189 --> 03:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
officer searches your car and you say
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
well I never gave him permission and he
 
03:27:56.229 --> 03:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
says yeah yeah he did give me permission
 
03:27:59.870 --> 03:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
you see a problem with that I do uh I do
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
see a problem with that um as someone
 
03:28:03.150 --> 03:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
who has gone through the criminal
 
03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
justice system um and I've seen many
 
03:28:06.830 --> 03:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
individuals go through the criminal
 
03:28:10.110 --> 03:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
justice system it does it does create a
 
03:28:12.830 --> 03:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
frustration um on the individual's part
 
03:28:15.030 --> 03:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
when they feel as if well when they find
 
03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
out that they have had a right that was
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
never um exercised or that they did
 
03:28:22.309 --> 03:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
exercise a right and it's not being
 
03:28:26.189 --> 03:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
recognized that that can provide um
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
complications especially when trying to
 
03:28:32.030 --> 03:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
sort out a case um in the courts uh but
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
as we heard that the courts would um you
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
know the judge would then start making
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
that determination um then but that can
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:45.040 --> 03:28:51.150 align:start position:0%
 
problem

03:28:51.150 --> 03:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands raised I want to thank
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.469 --> 03:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any members of the
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
public who wish to testify that are
 
03:29:06.269 --> 03:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
present that have not already
 
03:29:15.030 --> 03:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:15.040 --> 03:29:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
hand

03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:29:21.309 --> 03:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
hello uh can you hear me yes thank you
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
so much so uh again my name is
 
03:29:26.710 --> 03:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
as um I'm calling in because I support
 
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
this bill uh because police have an a
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
certain kind of authority within our
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
community um people will oftentimes just
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
do as they're told and so if they're
 
03:29:40.670 --> 03:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
even being asked a question uh it'll be
 
03:29:42.870 --> 03:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
thought of as mandatory versus the
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
choice that they can actually refuse um
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
I can tell as well as someone who's done
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
several know your rights presentations
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the Upper Valley um with a lawyer
 
03:29:55.269 --> 03:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
most people had no idea that they can
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
actually U refuse a search um so why is
 
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
this important because studies show over
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
and over again that people get racially
 
03:30:05.469 --> 03:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
profiled who've done nothing that
 
03:30:08.710 --> 03:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
warrants a search so for example um if
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
an officer stops someone for a traffic
 
03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
violation um but because of what we know
 
03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
happens often times to people of at a
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
much higher rate they're also asked if a
 
03:30:22.790 --> 03:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
police officer can search their car um
 
03:30:25.189 --> 03:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is not going to stop racial
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
profiling I'm not going to say that um
 
03:30:30.990 --> 03:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
this will end it but it can and it does
 
03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
help people know that they at least have
 
03:30:36.670 --> 03:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
a choice versus they must just accept so
 
03:30:38.710 --> 03:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
this is a step in the right direction in
 
03:30:40.990 --> 03:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion um yeah and so I think this
 
03:30:44.910 --> 03:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:44.920 --> 03:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
communities

03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.590 --> 03:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you see seeing No Hands

um I support this bill I feel like um
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
you know there was once upon a time um I
 
03:31:26.070 --> 03:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
wrote on the other side of the law you
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
know that was my past life and this uh
 
03:31:31.550 --> 03:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
I've gotten pulled over a couple of
 
03:31:31.560 --> 03:31:33.189 align:start position:0%
I've gotten pulled over a couple of
times

03:31:33.189 --> 03:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
times
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
and I didn't know that it was my right
 
03:31:42.550 --> 03:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to deny uh consensual um a search of
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
my vehicle and um the last time I was I
 
03:31:50.429 --> 03:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
was pulled over because my plates um my
 
03:31:52.269 --> 03:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
plates were out of date so he had a
 
03:31:55.750 --> 03:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
right to pull me over um and then he
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
asked me if I had any drugs and I told
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
him no and he he asked me to search my
 
03:32:03.229 --> 03:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle and I said for what because I
 
03:32:04.990 --> 03:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
don't have any drugs you pulled me over
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
for this for this particular reason and
 
03:32:12.189 --> 03:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
he told me um that if I didn't let him
 
03:32:14.189 --> 03:32:14.199 align:start position:0%
search my car he was just going to call
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
another officer a k9 officer and um have
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
the dogs come around my car there was um
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
he had no reason to do that and I feel
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
like um um there's a lot of racial
 
03:32:33.790 --> 03:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
profiling and as as um esma just said
 
03:32:35.229 --> 03:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
you know I don't feel like this bill
 
03:32:38.349 --> 03:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
will stop the um the the racial
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
profiling but at least it gives it gives
 
03:32:44.189 --> 03:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
the citizens and the community um an
 
03:32:55.070 --> 03:32:55.080 align:start position:0%

04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
04:10:28.590 --> 04:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
your that is seconded by representative
 
04:10:36.750 --> 04:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
Welles to speak your oh sorry I just
 
04:10:39.030 --> 04:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that um first of all I
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to uh thank representative K Knight
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
for bringing it forth and um I truly
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
believe that this might help some of the
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
conditions that we have with the
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
homeless and as everybody know
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
especially the larger cities really do
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
problem so hopefully a committee can
 
04:11:00.429 --> 04:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
come up with some data or some
 
04:11:02.590 --> 04:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
information that can help the state
 
04:11:12.229 --> 04:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.239 --> 04:11:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
issues

04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:30.189 --> 04:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
i' like to make a comment
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
I I told you about 10 years
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
ago I spent two years my company sent me
 
04:11:40.950 --> 04:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
out to C years and and that was a
 
04:11:43.630 --> 04:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
beautiful city a little bit of home but
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
it was really
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
a there's a there's
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
a out now it's
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
actually TV station I'm sorry we can't
 
04:11:57.389 --> 04:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
hear you I said there's there's a
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
there's a movie out now put out by a
 
04:12:03.990 --> 04:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
reporters on the local TV station in
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
Seattle it's called Seattle is dying and
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
they analyzed the
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
situation and they looked at it in other
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
states too also like Rhode Island the
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
problem with homelessness is
 
04:12:24.510 --> 04:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
not yeah wo is me the problem is drugs
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
and they they they looked at all the
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
people who were really homeless and they
 
04:12:31.229 --> 04:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
have a real problem out there and if
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
we're not careful we're gonna have the
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
same problem here and it was
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
almost to a person they they found drugs
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
was the issue and that's what needs to
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
04:12:47.830 --> 04:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
we've got same problem in Franklin our
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
police are fairly gentle with them I
 
04:12:52.670 --> 04:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:12:55.469 --> 04:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
but most of them they offer them a place
 
04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
to stay it's a place to stay as rules
 
04:13:01.870 --> 04:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
you can't bring
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
Contraband and they don't want to
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
go how do you cure that it's not a
 
04:13:09.710 --> 04:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
police problem it's really the
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
individual problem and it
 
04:13:12.119 --> 04:13:21.429 align:start position:0%
individual problem and it
drugs

04:13:21.429 --> 04:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.439 --> 04:13:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
represent

04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
P yeah thank you Mr chairman I would
 
04:13:29.710 --> 04:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
like to see this bill passed I don't
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a police job to do it but you
 
04:13:35.229 --> 04:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
know we have so many ordinance in these
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that won't even let
 
04:13:40.670 --> 04:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
little houses into them or any place for
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
these people to go and they don't all
 
04:13:43.680 --> 04:13:44.550 align:start position:0%
these people to go and they don't all
have

04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
drugs they paid low wages and once they
 
04:13:51.469 --> 04:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
lose a week work week of work they're
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
out on the street so we need to do
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.560 --> 04:14:01.309 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%

04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
I guess would be maybe for the sponsor
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
or or somebody else but uh the
 
04:14:16.429 --> 04:14:16.439 align:start position:0%
realistically the November reporting
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
back to the uh everybody is that going
 
04:14:21.670 --> 04:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
to after this has passed going to be a
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:34.790 --> 04:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
happen represent n you want to respond
 
04:14:34.800 --> 04:14:35.710 align:start position:0%
happen represent n you want to respond
to

04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:14:40.389 --> 04:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
that um I mean I hope that we can put
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
together a team of experienced
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
professionals and police officers
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
anybody that's willing to be a part of
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
this discussion and come up with
 
04:14:51.720 --> 04:14:53.229 align:start position:0%
this discussion and come up with
something

04:14:53.229 --> 04:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
um it's our responsibility to at least
 
04:14:59.550 --> 04:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
try so I'm going to do my best to meet
 
04:15:02.109 --> 04:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
any deadlines that we have does that
 
04:15:06.670 --> 04:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
question for me it basically didn't um
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
my question basically is you know I've
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
been in the legislature enough to know
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
that things don't happen very quickly
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
and to have a November reporting that
 
04:15:22.469 --> 04:15:22.479 align:start position:0%
compiles all the information to report
 
04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
back to these uh bodies uh doesn't seem
 
04:15:39.630 --> 04:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
me thank you chair I want to thank
 
04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative Klein Knight for bringing
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
this um Bill forward I think this is
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
definitely something that's needed um
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
within our communities and I will be
 
04:15:55.910 --> 04:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill represent Maron thank you Mr
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
chairman I several points to bring out
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
one is the fact that they want to use
 
04:16:09.510 --> 04:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
the whole state for this not just
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester this doesn't this bill does
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
not refer the homelessness in Manchester
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
not does it refer to the homelessness in
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
Nashville or in Franklin or in
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
Dairy and so this is a wide open thing
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
and like other representative pointed
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
out trying to get some resolve back by
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
November 1 I don't think it's possible
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
and last but not least I question to my
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
esteemed Vice chair is this a 28a
 
04:16:41.840 --> 04:16:49.389 align:start position:0%
esteemed Vice chair is this a 28a
issue

04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.790 --> 04:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
no than just just to address that and I
 
04:16:55.389 --> 04:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
understand the concern that maybe the
 
04:16:57.870 --> 04:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
issue of homelessness is not a problem
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
on a Statewide basis but what I
 
04:17:02.950 --> 04:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
understand from the testimony that the
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that came up involve
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
State Police so I think it's it's wise
 
04:17:08.000 --> 04:17:09.229 align:start position:0%
State Police so I think it's it's wise
to

04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
approve involve State Police the
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
argument could be made that is issue
 
04:17:13.920 --> 04:17:14.990 align:start position:0%
argument could be made that is issue
State

04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
State
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
concern Manchester biger highly pop are
 
04:17:23.070 --> 04:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
say although I don't I may not ha from
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
those districts I still think it's it's
 
04:17:24.560 --> 04:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
those districts I still think it's it's
relevant

04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
to state to look at at whole just my
 
04:17:30.590 --> 04:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
thought I don't think it's it's wrong to
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
the whole I think going be looking the
 
04:17:32.800 --> 04:17:33.910 align:start position:0%
the whole I think going be looking the
North

04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
North
 
04:17:37.109 --> 04:17:37.119 align:start position:0%
Country pop
 
04:17:40.030 --> 04:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
areas I hope the commission uses uses
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
the little time that they have to meet
 
04:17:45.830 --> 04:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.710 --> 04:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
up follow thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
04:17:51.469 --> 04:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a statement that I
 
04:17:53.710 --> 04:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
should have made my first time I will be
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
voting no on this bill based on what I
 
04:17:56.560 --> 04:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
voting no on this bill based on what I
stated

04:18:01.990 --> 04:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.950 --> 04:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
be leave it leave it for discussion
 
04:18:11.760 --> 04:18:13.790 align:start position:0%
be leave it leave it for discussion
representative

04:18:13.790 --> 04:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
I just like to say that I I will be
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and one of the
 
04:18:19.630 --> 04:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
reasons I like this bill is because the
 
04:18:23.070 --> 04:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
focus of this study uh isn't looking at
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
the entire universe of homelessness in
 
04:18:27.710 --> 04:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
the state it really focuses on the
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
relationship between uh between law
 
04:18:33.309 --> 04:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement and people who are homeless
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that over the last uh few
 
04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
months we've seen with a pandemic that
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
that that's actually been a real pain
 
04:18:39.720 --> 04:18:41.149 align:start position:0%
that that's actually been a real pain
point

04:18:41.149 --> 04:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:18:44.349 --> 04:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
and I mean in my experience study
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
committees that tend to be more
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
effective um have that kind of narrower
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
Focus uh I think it's what what a
 
04:18:53.550 --> 04:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
committee like that will do is it will
 
04:18:56.910 --> 04:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
definitely raise some some larger issues
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh that also need to be addressed that's
 
04:19:01.389 --> 04:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
part of the part of the deal but uh the
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
other part of it is is um it's not
 
04:19:06.990 --> 04:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
having served on three St study
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
committees um one of the things uh you
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
know that I just want to say is that a
 
04:19:15.149 --> 04:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
November deadline is pretty common and
 
04:19:16.349 --> 04:19:16.359 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we have a
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
November deadline is so we can draft
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
legislation uh in the next session if we
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
think any legislation is needed to
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
implement some of the recommendations
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
that we might have so a good example of
 
04:19:30.990 --> 04:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
that was the work that we did uh on the
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners uh pay issue so
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's an example of how the
 
04:19:38.550 --> 04:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
process uh can not only happen quickly
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
but can result in legislation that we
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
can actually you know get past so you
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
know to me this just seems to be a good
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
way uh to give us uh something to grab
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
on to that will allow us to start to
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
deal with this problem U as a body and
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
it it's definitely something that we
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
need to do we have a we have a housing
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state um we have an
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
economy that could be doing better
 
04:20:08.670 --> 04:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily working for a lot
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
of people at the lower end of the scale
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
and uh this is just something that uh
 
04:20:18.149 --> 04:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
strikes me is is good public policy um
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
that we can nudge forward with this Bill
 
04:20:21.439 --> 04:20:24.790 align:start position:0%
that we can nudge forward with this Bill
thank

04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
04:20:28.840 --> 04:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
chair

04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:20:35.229 --> 04:20:35.239 align:start position:0%
um this committee is pretty narrow
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
the the comme would be charged with uh
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
to study the response of law enforcement
 
04:20:42.720 --> 04:20:44.950 align:start position:0%
to study the response of law enforcement
to

04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:44.960 --> 04:20:46.750 align:start position:0%
to
homelessness

04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement doesn't really have
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
much to do with homelessness or housing
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
shortage and uh it also has the charge
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
of uh the study the response of the
 
04:21:04.269 --> 04:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system to
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
homelessness Criminal Justice System
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that much to
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
do with the housing
 
04:21:13.950 --> 04:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
shortage I heard testimony that people
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
are looking for data uh about the mental
 
04:21:23.189 --> 04:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
health issues and drug issues and
 
04:21:25.309 --> 04:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation all of which has nothing
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
to do with what this committee is
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
charged with is charged with the
 
04:21:30.630 --> 04:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
committee to study how the law
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh responds to homelessness
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
and how the courts respond respond to
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
homelessness I think on this bill I'll
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh I'll be supporting Mr M
 
04:21:52.269 --> 04:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.109 --> 04:21:55.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you represent true so I
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand the way the commission narrow
 
04:21:59.229 --> 04:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
focus of the commission my understanding
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
is the commission is going to focus on
 
04:22:04.710 --> 04:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
instead law enforcement response to it
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
when law it's when law enforcement is
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with any police Rel involv
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's just my understanding of what
 
04:22:12.680 --> 04:22:14.149 align:start position:0%
that's just my understanding of what
commission

04:22:14.149 --> 04:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
study and then the criminal justice
 
04:22:18.670 --> 04:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
system is the same way there are which
 
04:22:20.550 --> 04:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not really sure how that I'm not
 
04:22:22.030 --> 04:22:22.040 align:start position:0%
sure how that
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
part to it based on the testimony I
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
understand they could they could easily
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
over but I think at this point
 
04:22:32.189 --> 04:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
everyone's had a chance to speak so we
 
04:22:34.630 --> 04:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
can can put the matter of
 
04:22:34.640 --> 04:22:36.309 align:start position:0%
can can put the matter of
question

286 yes thank you for recognizing me I
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
didn't understand what representative
 
04:25:46.950 --> 04:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
Bert said and what that discussion was
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
about because there was only two um days
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
and 19 y the the off task motion this
 
04:25:58.990 --> 04:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
can be put on the consent C rather than
 
04:26:01.630 --> 04:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
having an individual uh be heard
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
individually it can be put on consent
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
and pass as part of consent
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
count so he's asked this this
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
bill be on the
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
consent it's on
 
04:26:19.750 --> 04:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
consent I remember when I heard this
 
04:26:22.950 --> 04:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
that consent on the consent calendar was
 
04:26:25.910 --> 04:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
unanimous doesn't have
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
have up to
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
two objections still have
 
04:26:34.830 --> 04:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
on representative Mar thank you Mr
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
chairman whether we whether you change
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
it here within committee or I have to go
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
to the to the clerk's office and ask has
 
04:26:44.670 --> 04:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
to be taken off consent and go on
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
regular calendar that will happen so I
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm asking is well when
 
04:26:54.510 --> 04:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative B moves to put on
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
consent that was you can still anyone
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
can take it off consent anytime they
 
04:27:01.870 --> 04:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
want supported off the test so but
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's the time when going forward you
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
want to raise that that
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
objection ionically represent
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.830 --> 04:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
represent Mar the reason I didn't object
 
04:27:21.469 --> 04:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
was I didn't hear what he was saying on
 
04:27:23.990 --> 04:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
comprehending I would have objected if I
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
had heard what he was asking for to be
 
04:27:27.550 --> 04:27:27.560 align:start position:0%
on the consent
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
calendar listen my understanding is that
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
we have L something he can still be
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
taken off in sense and and we're not
 
04:27:37.149 --> 04:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
ignoring what you have to say and
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
clearly you have an objection you sound
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
very confident that you're going to move
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
from so there's nothing wrong with you
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
doing that and it's any member of the
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
body to
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.149 --> 04:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
hour uh thank you Mr chairman um if you
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
don't mind me adding the only reason to
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
remove it off consent is if you're going
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
to have a floor fight on this particular
 
04:28:06.670 --> 04:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
bill um you know in the 11 years I've
 
04:28:08.870 --> 04:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
been here I've only removed one bill off
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
consent and but that's the purpose to do
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
it if there's not going to be a floor
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
fight usually it's better just to leave
 
04:28:19.109 --> 04:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
it on consent and let it go through and
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
then that way you know just saves a lot
 
04:28:21.990 --> 04:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
of time but if there's going to be a
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
floor fight then you need to put in a
 
04:28:23.840 --> 04:28:26.269 align:start position:0%
floor fight then you need to put in a
minority

04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.320 --> 04:28:29.330 align:start position:0%
board is that bill that
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:30.590 align:start position:0%
board is that bill that
[Music]

04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:28:30.600 --> 04:28:35.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
I

04:28:35.710 --> 04:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.710 --> 04:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
noes makes yes at this time we will
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh the ex session on hit
 
04:28:44.880 --> 04:28:47.550 align:start position:0%
uh the ex session on hit
286

04:28:47.550 --> 04:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
286
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
repres I was inquiring so it's going to
 
04:28:52.830 --> 04:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
be off the consent calendar because
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:58.109 --> 04:28:58.119 align:start position:0%
objection well my understanding is
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
representative Marson is going to take
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
it off the consent calendar is not
 
04:29:03.790 --> 04:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
agreeing to being on the consent
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
calendar so we already closed the
 
04:29:07.000 --> 04:29:08.630 align:start position:0%
calendar so we already closed the
hearing

04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure we can we can accommodate
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
that request and I in the interest of
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
time I say discuss I would like to
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
reopen the U executive session on hp1
 
04:29:23.550 --> 04:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
125 so we can discuss the issue of
 
04:29:40.510 --> 04:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
you uh this at this time we gonna U
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
hp25 at the time that we we went into
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
recess or suspended the executive
 
04:29:58.640 --> 04:29:59.670 align:start position:0%
recess or suspended the executive
session

04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
the was the point of order was amendment
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
has been offered but it doesn't have a
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
name of a member of the committee on the
 
04:30:11.630 --> 04:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
amendment in order for a Committee
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
Member offered that Amendment still I
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
did consell with the
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
clerk uh and I was advised that a
 
04:30:23.309 --> 04:30:23.319 align:start position:0%
member's name not have to be on the
 
04:30:25.950 --> 04:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
amendment it's only required that a
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
member of the offer the so the amendment
 
04:30:33.590 --> 04:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
that has representative Roy's name on it
 
04:30:36.030 --> 04:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
not a member of can be offered by
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
representing the
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
board I will say going forward it is
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
still a great practice to getting
 
04:30:43.750 --> 04:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
members name on the amendment because
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
you can probably count on that me
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
V representative ginate I believe you
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
were in the process of offering an
 
04:30:57.429 --> 04:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
amendment do you mind reading that
 
04:30:57.439 --> 04:30:58.910 align:start position:0%
amendment do you mind reading that
amendment

04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
number uh yes I still have uh would
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.920 --> 04:31:12.590 align:start position:0%
 
202-3851

04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
202-3851
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative Roy U presented during
 
04:31:18.030 --> 04:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
his testimony for
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
125 um it's very much similar to the
 
04:31:24.389 --> 04:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
amendment you had offered earlier but
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
without a
 
04:31:25.720 --> 04:31:27.469 align:start position:0%
without a
penalty

04:31:27.469 --> 04:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
um I think we should just uh accept the
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and pass the bill as
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
that Bradley you cing your screen are
 
04:31:45.070 --> 04:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
you seconding the
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
amendment not second do someone wish to
 
04:31:47.840 --> 04:31:48.870 align:start position:0%
amendment not second do someone wish to
Second

04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
Second
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:57.309 --> 04:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
amendment true U I'm not trying to come
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
up to work but I believe the
 
04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative when he made the motion
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
0385 it's
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
3085 which I don't have a copy of or is

point in us going forth In fairness to
 
04:34:04.189 --> 04:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
the members don't can't read it I only
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
expect can't
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%

04:34:11.029 --> 04:34:11.039 align:start position:0%
a public hearing at two I can answer
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%

against an amendment it's under my end
 
04:34:29.551 --> 04:34:29.561 align:start position:0%
understanding that in committee you must

have a written amendment in front of you
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
I agree with you 100% and that's why

we're not going forward with the
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%

don't just vote on amendments re so I
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%

04:34:50.551 --> 04:34:50.561 align:start position:0%
just say we move on to another one
 
04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:53.000 align:start position:0%

04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
question I we want to keep the point of
 
04:37:09.070 --> 04:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
order as an objection inter
 
04:37:14.551 --> 04:37:14.561 align:start position:0%

Amendment there although I respect the
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment the idea was to not have
 
04:38:13.109 --> 04:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount issue rep I think
 
04:38:13.119 --> 04:38:17.310 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount issue rep I think
amendment

04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%

04:38:26.670 --> 04:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that is where I have a little
 
04:38:28.109 --> 04:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
bit of
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
problem I want to try and wrap
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
everything into this problem B wants to
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.080 --> 04:38:38.750 align:start position:0%
 
17

04:38:38.750 --> 04:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
17
 
04:38:42.189 --> 04:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
right and she wants to say the first
 
04:38:44.189 --> 04:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
time somebody steals a dog it's a
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and the person that does
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
steal the dog whether they're a minor or
 
04:38:53.629 --> 04:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
an adult steals a eight or $9,000 dog is
 
04:38:53.639 --> 04:38:56.510 align:start position:0%
an adult steals a eight or $9,000 dog is
enough

04:38:56.510 --> 04:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.750 --> 04:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I leave that as a question
 
04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
committee may I answer that Mr
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
chairman you may
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
respond thank you uh Mr chairman and
 
04:39:14.670 --> 04:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
thank you f representative for the
 
04:39:19.150 --> 04:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
question or statement um if I'm reading
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
this right I can support this
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm
 
04:39:29.949 --> 04:39:29.959 align:start position:0%
assuming if little Bobby Tommy whatever
 
04:39:33.629 --> 04:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
his name is steals an $8,000 dog this
 
04:39:36.269 --> 04:39:36.279 align:start position:0%
goes out the window I'm guessing because
 
04:39:38.788 --> 04:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
of the value which currently if you can
 
04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
prove that dog is worth that much money
 
04:39:42.670 --> 04:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
and I hope somebody will correct me if
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong um you've already gone up to a
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
class B felony I
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
believe thank you Mr chairman hopefully
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
wrong so the misdemeanor would be wiped
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
out I did I didn't give my copy of the
 
04:39:58.878 --> 04:40:02.948 align:start position:0%
out I did I didn't give my copy of the
amends

04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if this a point

about I have before me I thought a an
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill as well from
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
representative test and are we hearing
 
04:43:29.830 --> 04:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
that or
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
not the one is so there only can be one
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment off all
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
right not to consider two amendments if
 
04:43:42.788 --> 04:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
anything the Amendments would have to be
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
combined I will say the the Amendments
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
the way they're written do not coexist
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
in any way so
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
them is theair the chair discre
 
04:43:55.000 --> 04:43:59.868 align:start position:0%
them is theair the chair discre
recognizes

04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.270 --> 04:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
understand very true thank you Mr chair
 
04:44:11.708 --> 04:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
uh I heard in testimony
 
04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
that current law states current law
 
04:44:14.560 --> 04:44:15.590 align:start position:0%
that current law states current law
since

04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
since
 
04:44:18.990 --> 04:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
1977 states that stealing a dog is a mis
 
04:44:21.510 --> 04:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
mean now we have an amendment that says
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
stealing a dog is a Mis
 
04:44:28.030 --> 04:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
me I I just think this gets Messier and
 
04:44:32.868 --> 04:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
Messier um certainly worthy of of
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
retaining I do I'm not quite
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
sure I know what we're passing
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
now just seems very very messy Mr very
 
04:44:46.270 --> 04:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
messy your point is well taken I think
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
the difference between what we're
 
04:44:56.750 --> 04:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
be Class A Class B Class A I had my way
 
04:45:07.230 --> 04:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
but the environment this room I didn't
 
04:45:11.130 --> 04:45:11.140 align:start position:0%
think that was happen so I share you
 
04:45:11.140 --> 04:45:14.868 align:start position:0%

and I we bought a dog was $3,000 if we
 
04:45:29.990 --> 04:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
stole $2,000 that's Class 8 I don't
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
understand how stealing a dog but that
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%

04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
just to clean it up for the people
 
04:52:02.230 --> 04:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
listening you want to just restate your
 
04:52:03.948 --> 04:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
motion I ought to pass it off the
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:09.520 --> 04:52:18.270 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
did he hear
 
04:52:22.590 --> 04:52:22.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Bo just to clarify
 
04:52:23.910 --> 04:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the members of the public listening
 
04:52:25.990 --> 04:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
at home because you did make a motion of
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
the pass offer an amendment that was
 
04:52:31.230 --> 04:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
about two hours ago so I think this for
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
the purpose of public interest to make
 
04:52:34.830 --> 04:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
sure everyone's falling along quickly do
 
04:52:37.548 --> 04:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
you mind just restating your
 
04:52:41.548 --> 04:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
motion the motion is to uh a to pass
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
laws or rsas punish
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
crime there's no
 
04:53:21.990 --> 04:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
punishment if you violate this this uh
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill becomes law there's
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
no punishment I don't see any value in
 
04:53:31.230 --> 04:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
passing anything if there's no way to
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:44.190 --> 04:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.270 --> 04:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
well I was going to say this last time
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
but uh you were more concerned about
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room but I have not
 
04:53:51.628 --> 04:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
received a revised copy of that uh
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.360 --> 04:54:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
now

04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that to my to our
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
attention the m cler is forwarding you a
 
04:54:19.390 --> 04:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
copy by
 
04:54:22.490 --> 04:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
email representative
 
04:54:22.500 --> 04:54:24.150 align:start position:0%
email representative
[Music]

04:54:24.150 --> 04:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:54:26.830 --> 04:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you Mr chair I just like to
 
04:54:28.548 --> 04:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
point out that you know that one of the
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
things that we try to do through
 
04:54:31.990 --> 04:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislation as well uh especially in
 
04:54:34.470 --> 04:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
this committee is to protect Public
 
04:54:38.670 --> 04:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
Safety um we also uh look at privacy
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
issues um I think one of the things that
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
we struggle with all the time is how
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
much to penalize people or to not
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
penalize people um I think
 
04:54:50.868 --> 04:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative Roy really sort of Hit
 
04:54:52.590 --> 04:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
the hit the nail on the head when he
 
04:54:54.990 --> 04:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
said that this bill you know basically
 
04:54:58.990 --> 04:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
hits a a sweet spot what it what it does
 
04:55:01.750 --> 04:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
is it prevents Behavior Uh that's
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful to an individual
 
04:55:06.070 --> 04:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
long-term who's never been convicted of
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
a crime um but what it what it also what
 
04:55:12.190 --> 04:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
it also Al seems to do is it also seems
 
04:55:13.350 --> 04:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
to split the difference with the
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
Public's right to know so um there's
 
04:55:18.548 --> 04:55:18.558 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that prevents a
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
person's name uh from from being printed
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
or that wouldn't make their name subject
 
04:55:27.590 --> 04:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
to a a right to no request so what it
 
04:55:30.590 --> 04:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
what it really does seem to do uh is to
 
04:55:32.350 --> 04:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
really kind of hit the nail on the head
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that situation the
 
04:55:36.150 --> 04:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative Klein Knight described
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
which is you know somebody literally on
 
04:55:40.750 --> 04:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
the worst night of their life who might
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
not even be convicted of the crime
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
having their picture permanently in
 
04:55:48.150 --> 04:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
social media maybe for the rest of their
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
life and being subject to uh to ridicule
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
um to me uh that seems to be a situation
 
04:55:58.830 --> 04:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's you know worth taking care of and
 
04:56:00.110 --> 04:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
that's within the purview of this
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
of Representative Maron thank than you
 
04:56:14.190 --> 04:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I simply want to
 
04:56:17.270 --> 04:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledge what my colleague he crossed
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
way from the representative true
 
04:56:21.350 --> 04:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's no penalty
 
04:56:23.670 --> 04:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
involved in this and with that being
 
04:56:27.670 --> 04:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
said I will make a I will vote no on
 
04:56:35.910 --> 04:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:35.920 --> 04:56:38.788 align:start position:0%
 
amendments

04:56:38.788 --> 04:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative should you need to
 
04:56:44.548 --> 04:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
recognize represent poer first represent
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
poer thank you Mr chair um just a uh a
 
04:56:50.510 --> 04:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
04:56:50.520 --> 04:56:52.190 align:start position:0%
little bit about
strategy

04:56:52.190 --> 04:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
04:56:55.948 --> 04:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
um it is a bill like this is a lot
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
easier to get through without a penalty
 
04:57:00.590 --> 04:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more likely to make it
 
04:57:02.548 --> 04:57:02.558 align:start position:0%
through the Senate be signed by the
 
04:57:05.628 --> 04:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
governor and in the next legislative
 
04:57:08.310 --> 04:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
session if we find that police are not
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
abiding by it that would be the time to
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
add a penalty if we add a penalty to
 
04:57:16.830 --> 04:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
begin with then we'll have the forces
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
arrayed against us and it'll never make
 
04:57:21.510 --> 04:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
it through the Senate so strategically
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment is a lot better than
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
adding the
 
04:57:24.760 --> 04:57:27.750 align:start position:0%
adding the
penalty

04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
thanks and I'm just going to say I
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand that there's some issues with
 
04:57:34.670 --> 04:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
not having a penalty
 
04:57:38.510 --> 04:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
that this is where we are now I
 
04:57:45.708 --> 04:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
agree I think this bill would be better
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
asserted that had a penalty written in
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
there but that amend failed
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
so I still think that the the policy is
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
is really good policy and I I'm going to
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
the representative B thank you Mr chair
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
um I was actually basically going to say
 
04:58:16.070 --> 04:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
the same thing that representative uh
 
04:58:18.628 --> 04:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
Hopper said but he said it better than I
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%

19 by a vote of 19 years and two n the
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
motion of to pass as
 
05:04:41.230 --> 05:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
amended passed Mr chairman if there's
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be a floor fight I would
 
05:04:45.390 --> 05:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
recommend consent but if there's going
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
to be a floor fight then is there any
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
consent I don't
 
05:05:00.548 --> 05:05:00.558 align:start position:0%
understand that what Mr representative
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
bur said about a floor flight I don't
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
think you have to have a FL fight for
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
every bill but I think by if
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
something passes with some no
 
05:05:15.270 --> 05:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
votes so I think somebody ought to be
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
able to speak about why they voted no
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
and let the house itself not get into a
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
big fight but just understand the
 
05:05:25.628 --> 05:05:25.638 align:start position:0%
arguments and maybe they will too decide
 
05:05:28.910 --> 05:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
to vote no on the whole thing in the
 
05:05:31.548 --> 05:05:31.558 align:start position:0%
house we just CL when representative
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
bird saying FL fight I don't think he
 
05:05:36.628 --> 05:05:36.638 align:start position:0%
means that negative under it's often a
 
05:05:42.628 --> 05:05:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.548 --> 05:05:46.558 align:start position:0%
ice so if there is two
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
objections two name in the rest of pass
 
05:05:53.230 --> 05:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
what can happen is if you put on consent
 
05:05:55.230 --> 05:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
and that usually when a matter is on
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
consent it means that there won't be a
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
four debates on the bill or on on the
 
05:06:05.310 --> 05:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
rec the motion so with that being said
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
if someone were to remove it froment
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
being removed tradition is the person
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
removing it normally would be the member
 
05:06:17.750 --> 05:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
participating in the FL debate so I I I
 
05:06:19.708 --> 05:06:19.718 align:start position:0%
believe what representative saying if if
 
05:06:22.430 --> 05:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
you don't intend on participating in for
 
05:06:25.470 --> 05:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
debate he's I think suggesting or trying
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
to encourage you not to object to this
 
05:06:27.280 --> 05:06:28.230 align:start position:0%
to encourage you not to object to this
going

05:06:28.230 --> 05:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
going
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
on that's my understand it is but what
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
we can do it's 208 we do have a public

05:06:46.990 --> 05:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
keep everything going is this a question
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%

so may may proceed sir yes you may
s

05:08:43.708 --> 05:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
s
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
um imagine a kid walking into uh a movie
 
05:08:50.750 --> 05:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
theater to watch an our
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
movie or going into a strip club and of
 
05:08:58.590 --> 05:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
course they can't but they can take any
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
smartphone and do it uh any smartphone
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
and get into that material there may be
 
05:09:06.788 --> 05:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
a saave search that can turn off but
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
they can get at it and so this this
 
05:09:13.390 --> 05:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
Bill uh puts a filter in uh to to
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening does not
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
prevent any adult from accessing any
 
05:09:19.708 --> 05:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
material they want they can sign up to
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
remove the filter for a nominal fee um
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
and that the money going from that fee
 
05:09:30.030 --> 05:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
to the state it is to is toh support
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
anti-child trafficking initiatives and
 
05:09:34.470 --> 05:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's a list in the Bill of what that
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
would do and this this uh bill as
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
written passes Constitution muster
 
05:09:42.670 --> 05:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
because Supreme Court and other courts
 
05:09:45.868 --> 05:09:45.878 align:start position:0%
have found out that filtering is a least
 
05:09:48.990 --> 05:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
harmful way of of of
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
of blocking material objectionable
 
05:09:54.548 --> 05:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
material so it does pass constitutional
 
05:09:57.708 --> 05:09:57.718 align:start position:0%
muster it does protect our children uh
 
05:10:00.030 --> 05:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
both from seeing un materials they
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
should not see and protect them from
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%

Representatives might recognize that

hb10 was presented in 2019 as
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
hb21 and it was referred to interim stud
 
05:11:12.470 --> 05:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
that summer came out of study with a to
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation and then came out of
 
05:11:17.430 --> 05:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
the committee with that
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation in a roll call vote in

hb21 which moved on to the Senate and
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
then covid happened and the rest is
 
05:11:37.230 --> 05:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
history the bill before you HB 180 is
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the same bill as it was as
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
hb21 it would increase the penalty for

eliminates distinctions between
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
traffickers and buyers by recognizing
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
the equal role buyers play in creating a
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%

05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
$4,000 hb180 would raise the penalty to

05:15:51.868 --> 05:15:51.878 align:start position:0%

School in their Journal of Law and

policy the fastest way to dismantle a

market is to dissolve the demand and a

study from the D Department of Justice
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
put this actly quote without the demand
 
05:16:11.190 --> 05:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
for commercial sex there would be no

05:16:23.110 --> 05:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
there be a force driving the production

05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
cause I am sensitive to and in I in

support of critical and meaningful
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
criminal justice reform efforts and I'm
 
05:16:51.788 --> 05:16:51.798 align:start position:0%
in full support of that however I am
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
simultaneously listening to survivors
 
05:16:57.430 --> 05:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
service providers and Advocates who
 
05:17:01.150 --> 05:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
continuously deal detail the severe harm
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
that buyers caused we are talking about
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
people who are paying to rape children
 
05:17:11.548 --> 05:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
and who our criminal justice systems
 
05:17:13.948 --> 05:17:13.958 align:start position:0%
have historically
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
ignored not over or unjustly
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
criminalized buyers have historically
 
05:17:24.110 --> 05:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
been insulated by meaningful criminal
 
05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
account by meaningful criminal
 
05:17:31.230 --> 05:17:31.240 align:start position:0%
accountability because of their social
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
status if we are willing to hold the
 
05:17:37.948 --> 05:17:37.958 align:start position:0%
traffickers largely people who are not
 
05:17:41.390 --> 05:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
white m middle class men accountable
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
with class A penalties then we must be
 
05:17:47.310 --> 05:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
willing to hold those who are actually
 
05:17:50.070 --> 05:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
committing the sexually violent acts
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
against children to the same
 
05:17:57.948 --> 05:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
standard regarding deterrence it's all
 
05:18:01.230 --> 05:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
but impossible to measure deterrence
 
05:18:04.708 --> 05:18:04.718 align:start position:0%
simple because we are talking about an
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
act that never occurred or never came to
 
05:18:09.868 --> 05:18:09.878 align:start position:0%
full fruition
 
05:18:12.548 --> 05:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
however penalties are not simply put in
 
05:18:16.110 --> 05:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
place to deter a crime they are put in
 
05:18:19.470 --> 05:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
place to hold offenders accountable to
 
05:18:22.350 --> 05:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
bring Justice to survivors and to
 
05:18:25.948 --> 05:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
increase Community
 
05:18:25.958 --> 05:18:27.510 align:start position:0%

05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
when House Bill
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
201 came up for um a
 
05:18:39.230 --> 05:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
vote Governor cunu sent to the chairman
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Cushing at the time a letter
 
05:18:46.190 --> 05:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
that said it is imperative that we take
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
this immediate action to further protect
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
victims of sex trafficking I am writing
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
you today to express my support of what
 
05:18:58.830 --> 05:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
was then House Bill 201 relative to
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
enhancing penalties for sex fires
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
exploiting traffic
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
children it is my hope that the
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
committee will strongly Endor the
 
05:19:08.280 --> 05:19:09.750 align:start position:0%
committee will strongly Endor the
measure

05:19:09.750 --> 05:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
measure
 
05:19:12.590 --> 05:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
at one time New Hampshire was a leader
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
against human trafficking as we were one
 
05:19:17.788 --> 05:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
of the first States to criminalize this
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
activity as a result service providers
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
across the state have been able to
 
05:19:26.390 --> 05:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
assist survivors of sex and labor
 
05:19:29.830 --> 05:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
trafficking to help rebuild their lives
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
we must continue that tradition signed
 
05:19:34.910 --> 05:19:34.920 align:start position:0%

05:20:02.548 --> 05:20:02.558 align:start position:0%
coordin thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you realize that
 
05:20:09.310 --> 05:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
we changed this uh the penalty for this
 
05:20:09.320 --> 05:20:10.548 align:start position:0%
we changed this uh the penalty for this
in

05:20:10.548 --> 05:20:10.558 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
2017 uh to a class B
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
felony uh as that made it a
 
05:20:21.390 --> 05:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
difference again as I I stated in my
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
opening testimony that detur is really
 
05:20:29.708 --> 05:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't or seems not to be
 
05:20:34.150 --> 05:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
able to be measured simply because it is
 
05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
a crime it's a crime that is
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
not that never occurred or it never came
 
05:21:07.548 --> 05:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:07.558 --> 05:21:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
measure

05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
representa thank you for thank
 
05:21:18.030 --> 05:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
question um you listed some states with
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.830 --> 05:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
stiff how come we're not asking for
 
05:21:29.628 --> 05:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
those penalties in
 
05:21:32.708 --> 05:21:32.718 align:start position:0%
this um I'm sorry representative you are
 
05:21:35.910 --> 05:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
breaking up so I couldn't hear the
 
05:21:38.350 --> 05:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
question dur your testimony you talked
 
05:21:41.788 --> 05:21:41.798 align:start position:0%
about some states that has some very s
 
05:21:43.470 --> 05:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
05:21:46.548 --> 05:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
these say that
 
05:21:49.070 --> 05:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
again could somebody sort of translate
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
what he's saying because he's really
 
05:21:52.310 --> 05:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
breaking up and I'm only getting C of
 
05:21:52.320 --> 05:21:54.070 align:start position:0%
breaking up and I'm only getting C of
the

05:21:54.070 --> 05:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
question during your during your
 
05:21:58.868 --> 05:21:58.878 align:start position:0%
testimony you talked about some states
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
that have a very strong penalty
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes why did why aren't you trying for
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
those kind of
 
05:22:10.190 --> 05:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
penalties because those type of
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
penalties are exactly what went along
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
with the federals federal guidelines and
 
05:22:18.350 --> 05:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
I know that looking at Criminal Justice
 
05:22:23.310 --> 05:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
Reform we're trying to um take in
 
05:22:25.510 --> 05:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
consideration the
 
05:22:28.590 --> 05:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
perpetrators um background and motives
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:33.080 --> 05:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
victims

05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Bo
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
my question um so in line seven and
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
eight neither the actor's lack of
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge or other person's age nor
 
05:22:53.070 --> 05:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
consent of the other person will
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
constitute a defense in a charge under
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
this paragraph now we're looking at a
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
felony charge so there usually in a
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
major crime like this we need intent and
 
05:23:06.910 --> 05:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
you are basically saying that intent is
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
taken out of the equation
 
05:23:11.310 --> 05:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
is is that what you really want to
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
happen again can you repeat your
 
05:23:15.230 --> 05:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
question maybe it's on my end of the
 
05:23:17.310 --> 05:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
computer but I'm having a hard time
 
05:23:21.670 --> 05:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
hearing you fine lines uh seven and
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
eight neither the actor's lack of
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the other person's age
 
05:23:30.830 --> 05:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
nor uh consent of the person shall
 
05:23:33.310 --> 05:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
constitute a defense to a charge under
 
05:23:36.110 --> 05:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
this paragraph now we are talking about
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
a penalty of a Class A
 
05:23:38.958 --> 05:23:39.670 align:start position:0%
a penalty of a Class A
uh

05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
felony um you're taking
 
05:23:47.708 --> 05:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
out uh intent as as a as uh part of the
 
05:23:51.510 --> 05:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh justification of of the penalty is
 
05:23:53.310 --> 05:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
that really what you want to
 
05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
do when you say taking out the intent
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
what do you mean usually when you have
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
are looking at a major crime that you're
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to be found guilty of you have to
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
actually do it and you have to actually
 
05:24:09.628 --> 05:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
intend to do it and uh right now you've
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
taken intent
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
away well if if you're referring to the
 
05:24:17.708 --> 05:24:17.718 align:start position:0%
one about the actor's lack of knowledge
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
that is already in um
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire as far as they
 
05:24:28.628 --> 05:24:28.638 align:start position:0%
cannot use that as a defense yes but
 
05:24:32.190 --> 05:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
that is as a a class B felony which I
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
think is is a little different than a
 
05:24:37.110 --> 05:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
class a felony because you're looking at
 
05:24:39.788 --> 05:24:39.798 align:start position:0%
Major prison
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
time you're ma you're looking at Major
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
prison time as far as it would be eight
 
05:24:49.310 --> 05:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
more years than the top penalty for
 
05:24:49.320 --> 05:24:50.470 align:start position:0%
more years than the top penalty for
class

05:24:50.470 --> 05:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
class
 
05:24:50.480 --> 05:24:51.990 align:start position:0%
class
B

05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
B
 
05:24:55.230 --> 05:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about children
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
and you're clunking them in a class B
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
felony that has to do with Computer
 
05:25:02.830 --> 05:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
Fraud and shoplifting I really think
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
that our value of children should not be
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
clumped with Computer Fraud and driving
 
05:25:14.590 --> 05:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
intoxicated for the fourth offense so
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
when I first introduced the bill for
 
05:25:22.030 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
class B felony I was told as you know
 
05:25:24.750 --> 05:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
that when you introduce things you
 
05:25:27.270 --> 05:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
should go in small
 
05:25:29.868 --> 05:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
increments so instead of going to a
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
class a felony immediately I decide I
 
05:25:36.270 --> 05:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
was it was suggested that I start with a
 
05:25:39.990 --> 05:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
Class B and that's what I
 
05:25:41.708 --> 05:25:41.718 align:start position:0%
did thank
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:25:50.350 --> 05:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
G um thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
05:25:57.310 --> 05:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
um my question is has there been any
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
data captured
 
05:26:02.350 --> 05:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
since um the bill changed from misdem to
 
05:26:02.360 --> 05:26:05.230 align:start position:0%
since um the bill changed from misdem to
across

05:26:05.230 --> 05:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.270 --> 05:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.280 --> 05:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:26:14.310 --> 05:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:14.320 --> 05:26:16.190 align:start position:0%
[Music]
follow

05:26:16.190 --> 05:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
clarification any data around um since
 
05:26:23.868 --> 05:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
it was um changed to a class B felony
 
05:26:27.390 --> 05:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
you have any data as to what effect it's
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
had on um I guess uh people doing the
 
05:26:35.708 --> 05:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.788 --> 05:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
again um I have looked for thata
 
05:26:41.670 --> 05:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
like that um representative but
 
05:26:44.750 --> 05:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the data does not seem to
 
05:26:48.310 --> 05:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
be there as far as the effects of this
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
because obviously you would have to do
 
05:26:54.548 --> 05:26:54.558 align:start position:0%
some sort of survey of people who might
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
be intending to have sex with a minor
 
05:26:59.310 --> 05:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't think you would have a very
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
willing um sample come forward to
 
05:27:06.110 --> 05:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
participate in that type of a survey and
 
05:27:09.868 --> 05:27:09.878 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I I haven't seen any data
 
05:27:09.878 --> 05:27:14.548 align:start position:0%
um so I don't I I haven't seen any data
regarding

05:27:14.548 --> 05:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
that the data that I was referring to is
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
people that have been arrested has there
 
05:27:23.788 --> 05:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
been any um increase in um the arrestes
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
or decreases in the arrestes that's what
 
05:27:28.510 --> 05:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for when I was speaking of
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
the data okay I I checked with the
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and at the
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
state prison in New Hampshire they do
 
05:27:42.110 --> 05:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:51.070 --> 05:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
you being No Hands raised I want to
 
05:27:55.868 --> 05:27:55.878 align:start position:0%

growing up in a hypers sexualized
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
hyperviolet world right now but I ask
 
05:30:17.788 --> 05:30:17.798 align:start position:0%
you to pass House Bill 180 and send a
 
05:30:19.750 --> 05:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
message to buyers that New Hampshire is

05:30:36.750 --> 05:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
tman thank you for letting me ask this
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you so much Char
 
05:30:44.190 --> 05:30:44.200 align:start position:0%
um do you think that we should pass a
 
05:30:47.350 --> 05:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
bill that would somehow carve out an
 
05:30:52.110 --> 05:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.868 --> 05:30:54.878 align:start position:0%
where person was under
 
05:30:59.868 --> 05:30:59.878 align:start position:0%
20 having sex with somebody 15 or
 
05:31:02.868 --> 05:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
16 I do sir and the reason for that is
 
05:31:05.430 --> 05:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
because their their brains just aren't
 
05:31:07.990 --> 05:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
developed and they can't really tell how
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
old a person is sometimes I think that
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
that would be um a beneficial carve
 
05:31:23.548 --> 05:31:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%

05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
went over by about 20 seconds however
 
05:37:42.948 --> 05:37:42.958 align:start position:0%
represent B you do have a question for
 
05:37:45.270 --> 05:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
the wits yes I do thank you Mr chairman
 
05:37:47.910 --> 05:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
how many states currently did you say
 
05:37:53.948 --> 05:37:53.958 align:start position:0%
have this uh a similar Bill and does it
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
work in those States because I know kids
 
05:37:59.910 --> 05:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
are you know if I need um anything done
 
05:38:01.708 --> 05:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
on my cell phone I bring it to my
 
05:38:04.590 --> 05:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
grandkids and they fix it uh yes sir so
 
05:38:06.150 --> 05:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
first of all there four states have
 
05:38:07.750 --> 05:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
passed the last section of the bill we
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
call it the admission act when it's run
 
05:38:11.470 --> 05:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
separately Texas was the first state
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
that's the part that says you got to pay
 
05:38:15.150 --> 05:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
$5 to enter a strip club that goes to
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
the same Grant fund that the onetime $20
 
05:38:18.868 --> 05:38:18.878 align:start position:0%
filter deactivation fee goes to that has
 
05:38:20.910 --> 05:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
been incredibly successful it's been
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
challenged it went to the Texas Supreme
 
05:38:24.750 --> 05:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
Court and the Texas Supreme Court upheld
 
05:38:26.670 --> 05:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
that in a case called comes versus Texas
 
05:38:28.830 --> 05:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
entertainment for two reasons number one
 
05:38:30.990 --> 05:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
the fee is nominal and number two the
 
05:38:32.670 --> 05:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
fee doesn't go to the general fund it
 
05:38:34.830 --> 05:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
goes to all of these kind of groups like
 
05:38:36.990 --> 05:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
the child advocacy centers and the human
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking task force and things of
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
that nature now Utah has passed a filter
 
05:38:43.468 --> 05:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
Statute in 2006 and it says this it says
 
05:38:45.670 --> 05:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
going forward in that state uh if a
 
05:38:48.830 --> 05:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
person has an ISP Comcast AT&amp;T they can
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
demand that the ISP install a filter but
 
05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
they can charge a filter installation
 
05:38:55.070 --> 05:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
fee so members of our team sued the
 
05:38:57.190 --> 05:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
state of Utah in 2016 to say you guys
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
got that backwards it should be that the
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
filter comes on the front end and
 
05:39:02.628 --> 05:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
instead of subjecting consumers like
 
05:39:04.150 --> 05:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
schools parents and teachers and
 
05:39:06.430 --> 05:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
children to a filter installation fee
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
there should be a filter activation fee
 
05:39:09.868 --> 05:39:09.878 align:start position:0%
now the the company should keep a piece
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
of that but the state needs a part of
 
05:39:13.750 --> 05:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
that so we can Finance all of these
 
05:39:15.230 --> 05:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
great groups in New Hampshire that we've
 
05:39:17.670 --> 05:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
been talking with that you know are
 
05:39:19.590 --> 05:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
fighting to uphold Community standards
 
05:39:22.390 --> 05:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
of decency so but no state has passed
 
05:39:24.430 --> 05:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
the filter bill but I mean every state
 
05:39:26.110 --> 05:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
touching you basically is running the
 
05:39:28.190 --> 05:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
measure I I can name the sponsors be
 
05:39:35.310 --> 05:39:35.320 align:start position:0%

special force of Liberty we've been
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
fighting pornography for about 15 years

and human trafficking for about six as
 
05:40:32.230 --> 05:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
we know that human trafficking and
 
05:40:34.350 --> 05:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
pornography are highly
 
05:40:37.990 --> 05:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
linked and we have children in every
 
05:40:40.510 --> 05:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
state that we run by we we work with
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
groups we work with legislators we're
 
05:40:43.868 --> 05:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
trying to do the best thing we can to
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
protect our children for the future I've
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
got three children three girls and a boy
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
and they have run into pornography on
 
05:40:52.628 --> 05:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
quote unquote accident and we know that
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
they're being targeted and we know they
 
05:40:57.590 --> 05:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
are being um coerced into seeing
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
material that is not constitutional for
 
05:41:03.030 --> 05:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
them to see as a child or is not safe
 
05:41:05.468 --> 05:41:05.478 align:start position:0%
for their minds and we know that sex is
 
05:41:07.350 --> 05:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
great in the right context but when it
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
comes to a child in certain forms in
 
05:41:10.750 --> 05:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
certain areas of pornography it is
 
05:41:12.868 --> 05:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
demeaning it is demoralizing and it
 
05:41:14.910 --> 05:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
gives them the wrong perception of what
 
05:41:16.708 --> 05:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
the human body is for and what the the
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
nature of sex is for so I would vote in
 
05:41:23.590 --> 05:41:23.600 align:start position:0%

Church here in New Hampshire and across

called human trafficking nothing less
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
than a crime against
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
humanity hb180 focuses on the most
 
05:42:18.310 --> 05:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
egregious forms of this most egregious
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
crime right now by definition we have a

class B type of penalty for what is

power god-given right to self-defense by
 
06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.040 --> 06:14:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
possible

06:14:38.150 --> 06:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:38.160 --> 06:14:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
represa

06:14:43.190 --> 06:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:48.110 --> 06:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
M yes thank you Mr chairman I am um
 
06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
definitely not going to support this
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill um uh essentially what this would
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
do is it would it would act to cut off
 
06:15:00.270 --> 06:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
public debate uh I understand the desire
 
06:15:03.788 --> 06:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
to protect uh the Second Amendment but
 
06:15:06.070 --> 06:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
clearly we're doing it at the expense of
 
06:15:08.310 --> 06:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment uh in this
 
06:15:12.030 --> 06:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
particular case uh I don't believe that
 
06:15:14.990 --> 06:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
we should be uh tying the hands of
 
06:15:18.830 --> 06:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
future legislators um when it comes to
 
06:15:21.190 --> 06:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh to changing our gun laws especially
 
06:15:23.390 --> 06:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
thing especially laws uh that would
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
actually increase safety um for gun
 
06:15:28.750 --> 06:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
owners and other members of the public
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
um this is uh this is bad public policy
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
and to put it in the state constitution
 
06:15:40.350 --> 06:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
mistake oh and one other thing that I
 
06:15:46.150 --> 06:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
did want to also raise additionally is
 
06:15:49.868 --> 06:15:49.878 align:start position:0%
it is extremely challenging and
 
06:15:53.030 --> 06:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to try to respond uh to
 
06:15:55.310 --> 06:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
executing these bills with absolutely no
 
06:15:58.590 --> 06:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
notice uh that they're coming um as a
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
courtesy uh to other members of the
 
06:16:02.468 --> 06:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
committee I would ask the chairman going
 
06:16:06.110 --> 06:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
forward uh to at least uh give us notice
 
06:16:09.430 --> 06:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
of a few minutes of which bills
 
06:16:13.030 --> 06:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
willes if you are I understand the pr
 
06:16:15.510 --> 06:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
that you're making right now you're
 
06:16:17.350 --> 06:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak
 
06:16:21.310 --> 06:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
on the whether support opposition of the
 
06:16:25.350 --> 06:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
motion of at the pass CAC if you want to
 
06:16:27.868 --> 06:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
discuss the the practice of the chair
 
06:16:29.430 --> 06:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's for a different time you not
 
06:16:31.590 --> 06:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
recognize so I'd ask that we just stick
 
06:16:35.230 --> 06:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
to the topic for now I didn't understand
 
06:16:35.240 --> 06:16:44.430 align:start position:0%
to the topic for now I didn't understand
your

06:16:44.430 --> 06:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:46.270 --> 06:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
frustration you wish to continue
 
06:16:48.390 --> 06:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
speaking to
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%

06:17:13.230 --> 06:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
forward um this really ties the hands of
 
06:17:14.750 --> 06:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
of anybody that wants to talk about
 
06:17:17.270 --> 06:17:17.280 align:start position:0%

Kerman I'll be supporting this but this
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
been about cutting off debate
 
06:17:37.468 --> 06:17:37.478 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that every day today this
 
06:17:40.670 --> 06:17:40.680 align:start position:0%

06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
about some question about vaccines you
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
kicked off of
 
06:17:53.310 --> 06:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
Facebook that's just not an excuse
 
06:17:56.390 --> 06:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
besides there's a tenament that says
 
06:17:59.430 --> 06:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
people the people get make these kind
 
06:18:00.948 --> 06:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
States and people get to make these
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions not the federal
 
06:18:03.760 --> 06:18:09.628 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions not the federal
government

06:18:09.628 --> 06:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:09.638 --> 06:18:13.468 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:18:13.468 --> 06:18:13.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:13.478 --> 06:18:18.590 align:start position:0%
 
Newman

06:18:18.590 --> 06:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:22.110 --> 06:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
CRA thank you Mr chair I'll also be
 
06:18:23.830 --> 06:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this
 
06:18:27.150 --> 06:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
bill and mainly because I think that
 
06:18:28.948 --> 06:18:28.958 align:start position:0%
some of the language even goes to
 
06:18:32.190 --> 06:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
bringing up votes and and voting on it
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
and it just seems that uh this cuts off
 
06:18:37.590 --> 06:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
the debate and that would be in our
 
06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the kind of Co that the
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
previous member just talked about not
 
06:18:44.708 --> 06:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
being able to debate that that's
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
something that private companies have
 
06:18:49.670 --> 06:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
done none of that is in the Constitution
 
06:18:52.948 --> 06:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
so I will be opposed to this vote I'm a
 
06:18:55.070 --> 06:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
vot I'm opposed to the way we did this
 
06:18:56.430 --> 06:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
executive hearing and I won't have
 
06:18:57.788 --> 06:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
anything else to say about this we have
 
06:18:59.230 --> 06:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
no way to
 
06:19:03.708 --> 06:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.718 --> 06:19:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
chair

06:19:09.910 --> 06:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:11.750 --> 06:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
your objection to the executive session
 
06:19:13.070 --> 06:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
has been
 
06:19:16.430 --> 06:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
noted representa Maron thank you Mr
 
06:19:19.628 --> 06:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a note here to myself
 
06:19:22.708 --> 06:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
and I want to question about that do we
 
06:19:25.468 --> 06:19:25.478 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to the C and is it in
 
06:19:27.230 --> 06:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
the works or
 
06:19:30.430 --> 06:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
what there I have not seen any Amendment
 
06:19:35.070 --> 06:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
nor is anyone offered an amendment on to
 
06:19:39.750 --> 06:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.468 --> 06:19:42.478 align:start position:0%
CR representative Wallace thank you Mr
 
06:19:44.948 --> 06:19:44.958 align:start position:0%
chair just a question uh to the members
 
06:19:47.070 --> 06:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
who oppose of this on the basis that it
 
06:19:50.430 --> 06:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
makes that it stifles public uh input um
 
06:19:53.390 --> 06:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
and the questions you do realize that
 
06:19:54.990 --> 06:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
should this pass the house and the
 
06:19:58.628 --> 06:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
Senate it will go onto the ballot for
 
06:20:01.708 --> 06:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
the citizens in to vote on which I can't
 
06:20:03.510 --> 06:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
think of any other way to get more
 
06:20:05.070 --> 06:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
public input by putting question
 
06:20:09.510 --> 06:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%

06:20:35.868 --> 06:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
know why we're spending much time on it
 
06:20:35.878 --> 06:20:40.430 align:start position:0%
know why we're spending much time on it
thank

06:20:40.430 --> 06:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
you representative y um I also want to

06:20:50.110 --> 06:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
remind people that um at the end of the
 
06:20:53.468 --> 06:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
day of that hearing the support was 35
 
06:20:57.110 --> 06:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the the opposition was 166 and even
 
06:20:59.670 --> 06:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
more importantly uh Gun Owners of
 
06:21:01.590 --> 06:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
America were
 
06:21:06.310 --> 06:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
neutral so you know that long you know
 
06:21:09.030 --> 06:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
by itself says that obviously there's
 
06:21:10.670 --> 06:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
other more work to be done or there's a
 
06:21:19.990 --> 06:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:23.430 --> 06:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
bill representative roads Mr chairman I
 
06:21:25.510 --> 06:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to um say something in
 
06:21:27.468 --> 06:21:27.478 align:start position:0%
regards to with respect to
 
06:21:29.868 --> 06:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative ter G just said which was
 
06:21:31.868 --> 06:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
we do hear that a lot that you know how
 
06:21:34.030 --> 06:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
many people were here today testify but
 
06:21:35.590 --> 06:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
I think that sometimes we fail to take
 
06:21:38.110 --> 06:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
into account how many people have come
 
06:21:42.030 --> 06:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
up to us in our person and or sent
 
06:21:45.070 --> 06:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
countless emails that we all receive and
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
my personal email exploded with
 
06:21:50.750 --> 06:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly yes to all anything that
 
06:21:57.430 --> 06:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:00.270 --> 06:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
that fin thank you Mr chairman I just
 
06:22:01.868 --> 06:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
have a question since I was not here for
 
06:22:04.110 --> 06:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
this debate some could you or or someone
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the room remind me the threshold if
 
06:22:09.830 --> 06:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
this makes it to the Val then become
 
06:22:12.670 --> 06:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
what the number that it would have to
 
06:22:16.190 --> 06:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
hit I'm G answer this I hope I get right
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
sure some correct I believe in the house
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's require 60% vote as well as the
 
06:22:25.190 --> 06:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
Senate at that point if it's on the
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
ballot we need
 
06:22:32.350 --> 06:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
two know that you I believe you're
 
06:22:54.788 --> 06:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:56.910 --> 06:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
majority the other comment that I would
 
06:23:00.670 --> 06:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
like is at least when we get the um the
 
06:23:03.270 --> 06:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
testify sheet we can see the telephone
 
06:23:05.390 --> 06:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
numbers and when I can say is the
 
06:23:08.750 --> 06:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
majority of those were 603 numbers all
 
06:23:12.910 --> 06:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
right however what comes in our mailbox
 
06:23:23.750 --> 06:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:27.270 --> 06:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
States so I so basically if I'm GNA pay
 
06:23:28.948 --> 06:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
attention to something I'm going to be
 
06:23:31.510 --> 06:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking at you know where those uh
 
06:23:35.070 --> 06:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
people that are are for or closing or or
 
06:23:37.868 --> 06:23:37.878 align:start position:0%
um for a bill I'm really looking at
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
their telephone numbers or their
 
06:23:42.628 --> 06:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
addresses that they provide
 
06:23:45.150 --> 06:23:45.160 align:start position:0%
that and I will say I
 
06:23:49.788 --> 06:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
think in respect of that do get the 60%
 
06:23:54.110 --> 06:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
voted sign go to the bot every person
 
06:23:55.750 --> 06:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
they support
 
06:23:58.030 --> 06:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
opposition assuming they resent of the
 
06:24:01.510 --> 06:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
state time will be have opport to V on I
 
06:24:05.030 --> 06:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
think that's the that matters most
 
06:24:05.040 --> 06:24:10.430 align:start position:0%
think that's the that matters most
that

06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:23.788 --> 06:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:27.910 --> 06:24:27.920 align:start position:0%

recogniz I think you
 
06:28:36.190 --> 06:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
muted chair um I am a little concerned
 
06:28:39.070 --> 06:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
about what bills we are executing on
 
06:28:43.468 --> 06:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
each day uh I understand and it it's
 
06:28:46.910 --> 06:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
legal to to exact bills that we are
 
06:28:49.270 --> 06:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing the day that we are without any
 
06:28:54.468 --> 06:28:54.478 align:start position:0%
other notice so we heard on other days
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
without public notice I think is a issue
 
06:29:01.590 --> 06:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh there uh should there are people that
 
06:29:03.670 --> 06:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
are interested in those bills and if
 
06:29:06.310 --> 06:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're not know notice that there are
 
06:29:10.750 --> 06:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to be an executive session then uh
 
06:29:12.310 --> 06:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
you didn't complain last
 
06:29:15.030 --> 06:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
year was
 
06:29:19.548 --> 06:29:19.558 align:start position:0%
a representative B your concern is
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
understandable I will say that this the
 
06:29:25.830 --> 06:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
rules uh that we've adopted the
 
06:29:27.788 --> 06:29:27.798 align:start position:0%
executive session to be conducted this
 
06:29:30.868 --> 06:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
way on under regular circumstances I
 
06:29:32.868 --> 06:29:32.878 align:start position:0%
would share your philosophy on how to
 
06:29:34.708 --> 06:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
schedule executive session
 
06:29:36.430 --> 06:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to feel other questions or
 
06:29:37.948 --> 06:29:37.958 align:start position:0%
any responses to what I'm saying now
 
06:29:40.150 --> 06:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
this is the rule the chair has the
 
06:29:42.788 --> 06:29:42.798 align:start position:0%
discretion to call the executive session
 
06:29:44.110 --> 06:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
represent I'm not going to recognize
 
06:29:46.628 --> 06:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
anyone to speak so you want to keep your
 
06:29:49.030 --> 06:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
hand up you can I'm just explaining it's
 
06:29:51.948 --> 06:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
within disc of the chair if I even
 
06:29:54.670 --> 06:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
hinted at when executive sessions were
 
06:29:56.670 --> 06:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to be called a lot of it depends
 
06:29:58.750 --> 06:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
on the scheduling and how much time we
 
06:30:00.670 --> 06:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
have between the hearings so I couldn't
 
06:30:02.350 --> 06:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
even give you that if I want to even lay
 
06:30:04.830 --> 06:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
it out for you I couldn't actually do
 
06:30:07.628 --> 06:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
so it would be more misleading for me to
 
06:30:08.990 --> 06:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
give you a schedule but KN one you
 
06:30:11.110 --> 06:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't follow it but this is permitted
 
06:30:13.868 --> 06:30:13.878 align:start position:0%
and I recommend to everyone for any
 
06:30:15.990 --> 06:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have public hearing to be
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
prepared for to go towards an executive
 
06:30:21.110 --> 06:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
session that's the best I can offer
 
06:30:24.868 --> 06:30:24.878 align:start position:0%
right now um the only and I've been very
 
06:30:26.430 --> 06:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
I would say I've been very fair with it
 
06:30:28.070 --> 06:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't when people get up I
 
06:30:30.350 --> 06:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't try to take advantage of situation
 
06:30:33.030 --> 06:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
so I'm not gonna take any questions on
 
06:30:34.910 --> 06:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
this right now we're going to move on to
 
06:30:37.070 --> 06:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
the next executive session I want to use
 
06:30:40.750 --> 06:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
the hour and a half we have um wisely if
 
06:30:42.468 --> 06:30:42.478 align:start position:0%
you'd like to discuss your concern for
 
06:30:45.468 --> 06:30:45.478 align:start position:0%
me after do our own time right but this
 
06:30:47.110 --> 06:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
time I'm going to close the executive
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:03.110 --> 06:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
R8 this time we're going open open the
 
06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%

06:39:24.750 --> 06:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um chair uh
 
06:39:27.350 --> 06:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone I
 
06:39:29.350 --> 06:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
really um I'm
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I'm not trying to be
 
06:39:34.628 --> 06:39:34.638 align:start position:0%
disrespectful uh representative but I
 
06:39:36.910 --> 06:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
just don't find this necessary at all
 
06:39:40.190 --> 06:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
because whenever you download something
 
06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
or enter into a contract with an
 
06:39:46.030 --> 06:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
electronic company tech company you as
 
06:39:49.350 --> 06:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
the consumer are already made aware and
 
06:39:51.948 --> 06:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
fine print of your rights and you
 
06:39:54.510 --> 06:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
actually have to click on I accept these
 
06:39:57.150 --> 06:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
rights in order to use this software or
 
06:40:00.628 --> 06:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
Hardware or it is your choice to go on
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
your daily business and that is a
 
06:40:06.230 --> 06:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
contract that's already enabled and and
 
06:40:08.548 --> 06:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
informs people of the rights what this
 
06:40:11.788 --> 06:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
is going to do is not change anything
 
06:40:13.468 --> 06:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
except there's a fiscal note which is
 
06:40:15.230 --> 06:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to cost our people money I don't
 
06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
think this is enforcable with your
 
06:40:19.590 --> 06:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
intent your intent is good I get it we
 
06:40:21.910 --> 06:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taking advantage of people
 
06:40:23.788 --> 06:40:23.798 align:start position:0%
that don't know what's happening on
 
06:40:26.468 --> 06:40:26.478 align:start position:0%
their electronic devices but again it's
 
06:40:28.388 --> 06:40:28.398 align:start position:0%
their consumers
 
06:40:31.350 --> 06:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility and with that I I can't
 
06:40:33.388 --> 06:40:33.398 align:start position:0%
support this I don't think it's fair to
 
06:40:34.990 --> 06:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
people that are aware and know how to
 
06:40:37.548 --> 06:40:37.558 align:start position:0%
use technology and for the taxpayers to
 
06:40:40.150 --> 06:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
pay uh you know on something that
 
06:40:42.548 --> 06:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
somebody else just isn't educated enough
 
06:40:45.548 --> 06:40:45.558 align:start position:0%
on how to turn their privacy settings on
 
06:40:47.030 --> 06:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
is just not fair to the rest of the
 
06:40:52.030 --> 06:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:54.350 --> 06:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
state thank you represent
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
n representative
 
06:40:59.030 --> 06:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
Muse I would have to agree with
 
06:41:01.548 --> 06:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
representative Klein Knight um I think
 
06:41:03.510 --> 06:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's incumbent on on
 
06:41:05.190 --> 06:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
everybody in the digital age is to know
 
06:41:07.270 --> 06:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
how to manage their own individual
 
06:41:09.708 --> 06:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
privacy settings uh and when it came to
 
06:41:13.150 --> 06:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
finding the co ab app uh representative
 
06:41:14.830 --> 06:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
testerman didn't have any problems
 
06:41:17.030 --> 06:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
finding it and when he found it it

a motion of OD to pass I believe you

offering an amendment is that correct me
 
06:46:00.868 --> 06:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong is that Amendment
 
06:46:04.230 --> 06:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
2021 049
 
06:46:08.388 --> 06:46:08.398 align:start position:0%

06:46:11.868 --> 06:46:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh make a motion about to pass on house
 
06:46:16.868 --> 06:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
485 and I would move amendment
 
06:46:19.388 --> 06:46:19.398 align:start position:0%
04098 is there a
 
06:46:24.350 --> 06:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
second I'll second it that that motion
 
06:46:27.948 --> 06:46:27.958 align:start position:0%

06:46:31.708 --> 06:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
B speak to the
 
06:46:35.110 --> 06:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I think the amendment
 
06:46:35.120 --> 06:46:41.548 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I think the amendment
basically

06:46:41.548 --> 06:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:41.558 --> 06:46:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
clarifies

06:46:43.190 --> 06:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
06:46:46.190 --> 06:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
that if somebody stopped and the police
 
06:46:48.708 --> 06:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
officer asked to certific car there has
 
06:46:49.910 --> 06:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
verification that the person gave their
 
06:46:56.868 --> 06:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
consent so I support the amendment and
 
06:46:58.708 --> 06:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
the bill I think the
 
06:47:01.270 --> 06:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
U especially for younger people when
 
06:47:02.910 --> 06:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're confronted with police officer
 
06:47:06.510 --> 06:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
off and the police officer says you know
 
06:47:09.150 --> 06:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to search your car is that all
 
06:47:12.468 --> 06:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
right their natural inclination is to be
 
06:47:16.388 --> 06:47:16.398 align:start position:0%
bullied into into say yes
 
06:47:19.190 --> 06:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
this gives them that understanding that
 
06:47:21.868 --> 06:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
they do not have to say yes and if they
 
06:47:24.788 --> 06:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
do say yes there's documentation so that
 
06:47:27.788 --> 06:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
it's not disputable later
 
06:47:31.350 --> 06:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
on just to speak on that point the
 
06:47:35.310 --> 06:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically lines 11 and 12
 
06:47:37.350 --> 06:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
they all does add a single
 
06:47:39.910 --> 06:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
sentence original
 
06:47:43.310 --> 06:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
Bill essentially if an officer fails to
 
06:47:47.230 --> 06:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
comply with provisions of this
 
06:47:49.708 --> 06:47:49.718 align:start position:0%
section as a matter of law the search is
 
06:47:52.510 --> 06:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
going to be deemed to be nonc
 
06:47:55.430 --> 06:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
consens I would say and this is just
 
06:47:58.628 --> 06:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
particularly relevant in possession
 
06:48:02.110 --> 06:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
cases when an officer sech a vehicle the
 
06:48:04.788 --> 06:48:04.798 align:start position:0%
the real that is at least the majority
 
06:48:07.708 --> 06:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
of it often can often be whether the
 
06:48:09.150 --> 06:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
search itself was
 
06:48:12.110 --> 06:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
lawful if if a person can sense of the
 
06:48:15.190 --> 06:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
search all the search seizure
 
06:48:20.350 --> 06:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
Wass is we can spend hours a semester of
 
06:48:22.910 --> 06:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
lecturing on search and seizure laws
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
which we certainly won't do that
 
06:48:27.670 --> 06:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
today but if you consent to the search
 
06:48:31.270 --> 06:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
all that's out the door here the concern
 
06:48:33.388 --> 06:48:33.398 align:start position:0%
is that he said she said was whether the
 
06:48:35.110 --> 06:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
person consented or
 
06:48:37.868 --> 06:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
not this bill is very
 
06:48:40.190 --> 06:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
specific great job identifying this
 
06:48:44.070 --> 06:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
being writing a b body reporting I know
 
06:48:45.990 --> 06:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully one day the body caners will
 
06:48:48.150 --> 06:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
solve that for us but most officers that
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
I would hope have some type of SM that
 
06:48:54.430 --> 06:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
would have a recording on as well either
 
06:48:57.110 --> 06:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
way the point is is that this would just
 
06:48:59.708 --> 06:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
failure comply with it you're not going
 
06:49:01.548 --> 06:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
be able to say oh the person sent to
 
06:49:04.030 --> 06:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
search it does not change any other part
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:10.030 --> 06:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
sentence representative
 
06:49:12.788 --> 06:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
gate thank you Mr chair I don't have a
 
06:49:16.070 --> 06:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
copy of this amendment was it sent
 
06:49:19.708 --> 06:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
out I certainly hope
 
06:49:22.788 --> 06:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
so do the people at home
 
06:49:25.350 --> 06:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
have I don't have the amendment to this
 
06:49:28.990 --> 06:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill I was it sent electronically or I
 
06:49:31.628 --> 06:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have one printed
 
06:49:34.150 --> 06:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
all I think it was on the State website
 
06:49:35.590 --> 06:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
or state
 
06:49:40.708 --> 06:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
emails I think Karen sent it Mr chair I
 
06:49:43.030 --> 06:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
understanding the uh committee assistant
 
06:49:45.948 --> 06:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:48.230 --> 06:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
electronically but what I will just I
 
06:49:50.510 --> 06:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
can although it's prefer to everyone
 
06:49:51.990 --> 06:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
read it I'll just read the one L
 
06:49:53.548 --> 06:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
sentence this literally adds one
 
06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
sentence beginning line 11 it says an
 
06:49:58.788 --> 06:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
officer who fails to comply with the
 
06:50:00.350 --> 06:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
requirements of this
 
06:50:03.190 --> 06:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph proceeds with a search shall

06:50:11.948 --> 06:50:11.958 align:start position:0%
consent that's all the amendment
 
06:50:14.708 --> 06:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
acts it doesn't to change any other
 
06:50:17.388 --> 06:50:17.398 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of
 
06:50:17.398 --> 06:50:21.990 align:start position:0%

06:50:42.310 --> 06:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
new the representative that gives us the
 
06:50:44.628 --> 06:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
support numbers and opposed numbers did
 
06:50:47.070 --> 06:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
he give us them yes this piece of
 
06:50:49.628 --> 06:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
legislation supporting and
 
06:50:52.868 --> 06:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
opposing represent the
 
06:50:58.430 --> 06:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:01.548 --> 06:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
moment and we are
 
06:51:01.558 --> 06:51:03.590 align:start position:0%
moment and we are
are

06:51:03.590 --> 06:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:51:05.910 --> 06:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
there were 96 people who signed in in
 
06:51:08.310 --> 06:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
support of this bill two who signed in
 
06:51:10.670 --> 06:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition and one person who signed
 
06:51:19.548 --> 06:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:21.868 --> 06:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
neutral represented
 
06:51:25.548 --> 06:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
true I apologize Mr chair but I think
 
06:51:27.070 --> 06:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
you you made a comment that the only
 
06:51:31.510 --> 06:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
change was conducting a search without
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
consent but the other change is uh
 
06:51:40.628 --> 06:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:42.830 --> 06:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
consent document concept wasn't in the
 
06:51:52.110 --> 06:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:54.830 --> 06:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
cor that's not what I had let me just
 
06:51:54.840 --> 06:52:01.510 align:start position:0%
cor that's not what I had let me just
confirm

06:52:01.510 --> 06:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:01.520 --> 06:52:04.540 align:start position:0%
 
that

06:52:04.540 --> 06:52:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:04.550 --> 06:52:10.548 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:52:10.548 --> 06:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:13.110 --> 06:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
TR I thank you for pointing that up
 
06:52:15.990 --> 06:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is I think the second sentence of
 
06:52:17.350 --> 06:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment is also
 
06:52:20.070 --> 06:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
different point that
 
06:52:22.628 --> 06:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
out and that line says if a person
 
06:52:24.670 --> 06:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
consents to aarch the off first document
 
06:52:26.030 --> 06:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
the person's consent either in writing
 
06:52:27.590 --> 06:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
or by audio
 
06:52:30.590 --> 06:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
recording then they conduct The Sur that
 
06:52:35.868 --> 06:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:41.868 --> 06:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:45.030 --> 06:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
was and what that what that does is that
 
06:52:47.310 --> 06:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
first of all that clarifies that should
 
06:52:49.350 --> 06:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
be done prior to the search you're going
 
06:52:51.788 --> 06:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
to document being
 
06:52:55.230 --> 06:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
done it should be done you
 
06:52:57.670 --> 06:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
know documenting it after the fact I
 
06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:01.440 --> 06:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
successful

06:53:17.510 --> 06:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:21.388 --> 06:53:21.398 align:start position:0%
wait any anyone else wish to speak
 
06:53:23.868 --> 06:53:23.878 align:start position:0%

06:53:25.388 --> 06:53:25.398 align:start position:0%

06:53:28.510 --> 06:53:28.520 align:start position:0%

um Phil so we just sent it so he can

not be voting if he hasn't seen the
 
06:53:39.590 --> 06:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill the people at home not see anyone
 
06:53:59.030 --> 06:53:59.040 align:start position:0%

06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
one that you sent to Karen at sometime
 
06:54:12.750 --> 06:54:12.760 align:start position:0%

06:54:16.548 --> 06:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
also be voting against the bill without
 
06:54:19.230 --> 06:54:19.240 align:start position:0%

06:57:50.590 --> 06:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
question I just have a question would it
 
06:57:53.070 --> 06:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
be possible for the
 
06:57:55.230 --> 06:57:55.240 align:start position:0%
chairman if in fact we're going to be
 
06:57:58.270 --> 06:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
doing a series of executive sessions
 
06:58:01.590 --> 06:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
today and he has knowledge of of those
 
06:58:01.600 --> 06:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
today and he has knowledge of of those
executive

06:58:03.030 --> 06:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
executive
 
06:58:05.708 --> 06:58:05.718 align:start position:0%
of the bills that are going to be exact
 
06:58:07.150 --> 06:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
that at least we have that much
 
06:58:09.948 --> 06:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
information so that we can find the
 
06:58:12.030 --> 06:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
bills and the Amendments and bring to
 
06:58:13.948 --> 06:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
the chair's attention when we don't have
 
06:58:17.110 --> 06:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
the appropriate information thank you
 
06:58:18.750 --> 06:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
Newman I'll answer that question again
 
06:58:20.510 --> 06:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
while we patiently wait for represent
 
06:58:22.070 --> 06:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
Conley to forward the
 
06:58:24.750 --> 06:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
amendment if I were to give a provide a
 
06:58:27.868 --> 06:58:27.878 align:start position:0%
list of of bills that I anticipated on
 
06:58:30.590 --> 06:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
on having the executive session on and
 
06:58:32.750 --> 06:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
gave you a precise order
 
06:58:34.190 --> 06:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
it would be nothing short of a miracle
 
06:58:37.190 --> 06:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we stuck to that schedule so rather
 
06:58:39.030 --> 06:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
than create a schedule that I'm not
 
06:58:42.190 --> 06:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
confident that I can keep and then it
 
06:58:43.868 --> 06:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
suggests that I'm misleading it what
 
06:58:45.590 --> 06:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
what not I'm not going to recognize it I
 
06:58:46.708 --> 06:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
already said I'm not going to recognize
 
06:58:48.150 --> 06:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
again but I'm just we have some down
 
06:58:49.350 --> 06:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
time while
 
06:58:52.670 --> 06:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
represent assisting the committee I will
 
06:58:55.628 --> 06:58:55.638 align:start position:0%
tell you that it is the rules permit an
 
06:58:57.590 --> 06:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
executive session to be
 
06:59:00.910 --> 06:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
conformed um at any time after the
 
06:59:04.190 --> 06:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing is that's that's a rule
 
06:59:05.750 --> 06:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a house rule it's also
 
06:59:08.708 --> 06:59:08.718 align:start position:0%
noticed that way in the count I will say
 
06:59:11.788 --> 06:59:11.798 align:start position:0%
it is a rule that is new for This this
 
06:59:14.510 --> 06:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
term with that being said I would
 
06:59:17.948 --> 06:59:17.958 align:start position:0%
prepare for bills to be exec at any
 
06:59:19.070 --> 06:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
given time
 
06:59:24.150 --> 06:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
therea uh I will also point out that if
 
06:59:26.510 --> 06:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
we have 20 minutes of downtime that is
 
06:59:28.070 --> 06:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
rather than sit around and stay till
 
06:59:29.910 --> 06:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
9:00 and every gets mad at me we're here
 
06:59:33.150 --> 06:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
till 9:00 I say we use that 20 minutes
 
06:59:35.830 --> 06:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
during sunlight and we conduct an
 
06:59:38.030 --> 06:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
executive session and that's the
 
06:59:39.670 --> 06:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
discretion the chair and that's how I'm
 
06:59:42.510 --> 06:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
going to conduct and I'm not g any more
 
06:59:45.910 --> 06:59:45.920 align:start position:0%

07:03:37.990 --> 07:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
if you've read the amendment please give
 
07:03:41.310 --> 07:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:44.030 --> 07:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
07:03:48.350 --> 07:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
m i i I do have a have a question on the
 
07:03:52.510 --> 07:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
on the amendment um the original bill um
 
07:03:57.628 --> 07:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
uh only required uh the officer to uh
 
07:04:00.150 --> 07:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
inform the person that the the amended
 
07:04:03.708 --> 07:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
Bill uh seems to require uh them to
 
07:04:06.110 --> 07:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
document their consent either in writing
 
07:04:10.350 --> 07:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
or in audio what I'm curious about is is
 
07:04:13.548 --> 07:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
does that what happens to that record um
 
07:04:15.468 --> 07:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
how is that record made is there a form
 
07:04:18.430 --> 07:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
in existence that would do that um where
 
07:04:20.910 --> 07:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
are those records stored who's looking
 
07:04:23.510 --> 07:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
at them is there is there a process
 
07:04:26.270 --> 07:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
around the paperwork I guess that's my
 
07:04:28.510 --> 07:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
question a lot of questions yeah I can
 
07:04:30.628 --> 07:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
answer some of them
 
07:04:33.468 --> 07:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
so I the best I can do is compare this
 
07:04:36.670 --> 07:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
to the the Miranda form nor when there's
 
07:04:38.990 --> 07:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
a charge someone's
 
07:04:41.430 --> 07:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
arrested they're often read their mirand
 
07:04:44.750 --> 07:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
and they provide form to sign knowledge
 
07:04:47.708 --> 07:04:47.718 align:start position:0%
them and it's it's really somewhat
 
07:04:51.030 --> 07:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
repetitive but it's signed that's part
 
07:04:53.468 --> 07:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
of the arrest record and then that's
 
07:04:57.708 --> 07:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
often turned over to the county to the
 
07:05:01.190 --> 07:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
district attorney is often produced
 
07:05:03.110 --> 07:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
Discovery so so I would imagine that if
 
07:05:06.628 --> 07:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
there was a form uh whether it's a paper
 
07:05:08.350 --> 07:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
form you would be maintained in the same
 
07:05:11.468 --> 07:05:11.478 align:start position:0%
manner syst with that keep in mind might
 
07:05:13.030 --> 07:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
not always be an
 
07:05:16.548 --> 07:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
arrest in addition to that if there was
 
07:05:19.270 --> 07:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
a video recording
 
07:05:22.110 --> 07:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
be maintain the same way cases I worked
 
07:05:24.750 --> 07:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
on has been photographed or videos taken
 
07:05:26.708 --> 07:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
by officers on their own personal cell
 
07:05:30.150 --> 07:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
phone devices that has turned over
 
07:05:32.510 --> 07:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
Discovery so
 
07:05:36.670 --> 07:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
those are those are ways to do that so
 
07:05:38.708 --> 07:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from testimony we
 
07:05:40.910 --> 07:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
heard that some departments already have
 
07:05:43.230 --> 07:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
a standard form and they already
 
07:05:52.670 --> 07:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:54.750 --> 07:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
process I guess another question would
 
07:05:57.190 --> 07:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
be um given the fact that some
 
07:06:00.070 --> 07:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
communities may not have that uh and
 
07:06:02.388 --> 07:06:02.398 align:start position:0%
that the the state police have it should
 
07:06:08.150 --> 07:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:14.590 --> 07:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:17.590 --> 07:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
paper I I do understand that it it is
 
07:06:20.468 --> 07:06:20.478 align:start position:0%
just a piece of paper but um I spent
 
07:06:22.948 --> 07:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
half my career moving people off of uh
 
07:06:25.548 --> 07:06:25.558 align:start position:0%
paper-based benefits enrollment to
 
07:06:28.230 --> 07:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
online benefits enrollment so I
 
07:06:31.590 --> 07:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit about uh how one
 
07:06:34.910 --> 07:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
piece of paper uh can be very
 
07:06:36.990 --> 07:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
problematic in a process I'm going to go
 
07:06:39.070 --> 07:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
off pure memory
 
07:06:42.910 --> 07:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
here my understand 35 says that it's if
 
07:06:44.510 --> 07:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal no is
 
07:06:47.788 --> 07:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
below a certain threshold actually not
 
07:06:50.868 --> 07:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
requir I believe that is $10,000 I would
 
07:06:53.270 --> 07:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
like to say to 35
 
07:06:56.590 --> 07:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
37 someone wants to fact check
 
07:07:00.270 --> 07:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is I I don't I
 
07:07:02.430 --> 07:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
would find it
 
07:07:06.548 --> 07:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
I would anticipate $10,000 spent on
 
07:07:12.788 --> 07:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:16.388 --> 07:07:16.398 align:start position:0%
Che but I I believe in that with that
 
07:07:18.430 --> 07:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
being said I don't believe in this
 
07:07:18.440 --> 07:07:20.190 align:start position:0%
being said I don't believe in this
case

07:07:20.190 --> 07:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
case
 
07:07:22.628 --> 07:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
necessary I actually believe this save a
 
07:07:23.948 --> 07:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
lot of money because if you don't have
 
07:07:27.430 --> 07:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
to in possession cases the majority of
 
07:07:29.628 --> 07:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
the defense involved
 
07:07:33.070 --> 07:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
inpression hearings this if we if this
 
07:07:35.468 --> 07:07:35.478 align:start position:0%
is done specifically done the right way
 
07:07:38.270 --> 07:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
it could clear up some time free up the
 
07:07:41.350 --> 07:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
off being paid over time hearings fre up
 
07:07:45.070 --> 07:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys free the course of
 
07:07:46.830 --> 07:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
course there's actually a lot
 
07:07:50.350 --> 07:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
ofal savings been actually
 
07:07:52.510 --> 07:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
now it's hard to quantify what that
 
07:07:55.070 --> 07:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
would be but I said a lot of these are
 
07:07:57.270 --> 07:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
are often decided
 
07:07:57.280 --> 07:08:00.430 align:start position:0%
are often decided
on

07:08:00.430 --> 07:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:00.440 --> 07:08:12.510 align:start position:0%

07:08:22.548 --> 07:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
it anyone have opportunity to speak
 
07:08:25.948 --> 07:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:28.388 --> 07:08:28.398 align:start position:0%
speak see no hands raised the matter
 
07:08:31.788 --> 07:08:31.798 align:start position:0%
will be put question this is most about
 
07:08:35.070 --> 07:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
the pass the question whether to
