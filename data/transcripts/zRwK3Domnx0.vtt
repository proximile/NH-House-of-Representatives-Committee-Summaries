immunization

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
registry uh so the agency did file a
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request that did
 
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
address all of the comments on the final
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
proposal however in reviewing the
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
conditional approval it was noticed that
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
there was one word missing on the
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement on the form that's in
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
the rule text um I have talked with the
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
agency I believe they're going to
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
request an oral CA to include that word
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
in the form
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
um and should they do that I would
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
recommend that this be approved uh
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
conditionally approved with that oral
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment good morning Allison radme uh
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
administrator of the administrative
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
rules unit at the Department of Health
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
and Human Services um we are in
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
agreement that um we will be making a
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
change to um mirror the rule text in the
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
form language um however we do ask that
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
we flip-flop that and we're actually
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to remove the word immunization
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
from the rule um and keep the form as is
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
so where where exactly in the rule is a
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
change we're asking for so anybody wants
 
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
to follow along oh I apologize it's on
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
our conditional approval request on page
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
seven and it's the first paragraph at
 
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.469 align:start position:0%
seven and it's the first paragraph at
the

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
top thank you so that sentence will read
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
received immunization as requested to
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
request withdrawal of information from
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
territory further discussion
 
00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.390 align:start position:0%
territory further discussion
representative

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you both
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
for being here um as I was reviewing
 
00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 align:start position:0%
this rule I noticed that none of the
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
information about um how we handle
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
withdrawals relative to other states was
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
included that had been in earlier
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
working drafts um we had put to get put
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
I had put forward legislation in
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
parallel with the Department's intention
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
to handle withdrawals from outof State
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
immunization systems um consistent with
 
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
our constitutional protections for right
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
to privacy
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
that had moved forward but it was
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
interim studied in the Senate because
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
they thought that it was unnecessary
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
because it would be included in rules
 
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
yet reviewing for the meeting today
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
those important protections were removed
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
and it was reversed in policy and I'm
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
curious I I'd like to understand why
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
made good morning Emory mcum the
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
immunization section chief um that was
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
changed because we um felt like it was
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
premature to go ahead and change the
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
administrative rules in the response to
 
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:05.879 align:start position:0%
the legislative session which did not
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
enact that legislation um it did go to
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
interim study we would be required to
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
follow um any statutory change that does
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
come down and and from that um interim
 
00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:20.919 align:start position:0%
study um we would also be doing our due
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
diligence first of all the IM
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
immunization information system is a
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary system so as part of the
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
consent for a person to share share
 
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:31.240 align:start position:0%
their information they would be provided
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
the information that their information
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
may be shared with another state if they
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
received medical care or immunization in
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
that state and um the patient if they
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
chose to um go ahead and participate in
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
our program they would uh and later
 
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
change their mind they would be able to
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
seek New Hampshire withdrawal and they
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
would also be able to seek withdrawal
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
through that other state directly um the
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
problem with the legislation was the
 
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
involvement of the department on the
 
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
onus of who was performing that
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
withdrawal um was it the Department's
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
requirement to do the withdrawal or was
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
it the individual person who may have
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
received vaccinations in other states um
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
because not everybody's data go would go
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
to another state if we did enact the
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
sharing of data which we don't do with
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
any other states at this moment in time
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
um it is really kind of we're trying to
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
be proactive thinking about this for
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
future use to let individuals know that
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
in the future it may be shared um but
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
once again that would only be for those
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who received care or
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in other states um and we
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
felt as though by um providing that
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
information they would consent knowing
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
that they had that um as a possibility
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
um make their own choice and then if
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
they later changed their mind after
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
participating they would be able to
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to that other state directly
 
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
to request that withdrawal and it would
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
just be removing the department from the
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
obligation of having to process that
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from another state system
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't have that access to that's
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
good 10 minutes um since representative
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
sh Schmidt has arrived representative
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips can sit in for Senator
 
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.190 align:start position:0%
hacken Phillips can sit in for Senator
wetley

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
wetley
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
sure sorry follow up yes please um I'm
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
actually really confused by that process
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I I greatly appreciate that after the
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
initial hear public hearing on this this
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
in October um we worked together and we
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
worked together in what I saw is good
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
faith um at that time I was told that
 
00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:40.839 align:start position:0%
there needed did not need to be any
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
change to the statutes in order to do
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
that because it was consistent with our
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
existing statutory Authority and it was
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
consistent with the State Constitution
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
and therefore I was told that it was
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for me to file House Bill
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
1669 in order to ensure that the Privacy
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
rights of our people are
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
upheld um so I'm very very confused as
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
to why when this was moving forward
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
prior to the introduction and drafting
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
of my bill that was never communicated
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
to me and the intention from the
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
Department I understood was that this
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
would be included in the administrative
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
rules and my bill was therefore
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but would be a belt and
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
suspenders approach um so that's where
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from and why I'm so surprised
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to know is when um these
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
confusions and questions were communic
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
ated to the legislature because it
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
sounds like through this process some
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
important issues came up which could
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
have been resolved through House Bill
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
1669 had we been aware of them so I'd
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
like to know who was made aware and
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
when so so just again so I think the
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
problem we have is a chicken and egg
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
problem right so we interim studied some
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
bills with a bill knowing that there was
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
a rule coming forward and then once we
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
inter studied the bill the rule went
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
away that was being proposed
 
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
where we're in a kind of a circular
 
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
logic kind of problem it seems that
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's more to it though because it
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
sounds that sounds like there were
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
issues that that that arose because the
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
the the statute change was intended
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
simply to back it up to make sure that
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the future it wasn't changed because
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
I was told the statute change was not
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
necessary um but it sounds like new
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
issues arose and I'm curious as to one
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
that was communicated okay sorry good
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
morning um I'm Abby Rogers I'm the
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
legislative Le to for the division
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services um I worked on
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation with our Bureau of
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
infectious disease team and wanted to
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
just make the committee aware that
 
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
during the the public hearing on the
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
bill we had had a conversation um on the
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
rules had had a conversation with
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
representative L on her attention on
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
filing a bill to do uh to make the
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
changes that we see um we suggested that
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
we would work with her and meet with her
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
to to sort of address some of her
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
concerns maybe in doing uh through rule
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
but we felt that uh she wanted to
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
continue with filing her legislation and
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
moving forward with that we had had some
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh initial discussions and we also had
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
had asked her to review our language as
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
well um we worked uh with the house
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee um and uh the bill was changed
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the house committee we also worked in
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
finance um with the parties on the bill
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
um and at the end of the day when the
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
bill got to the Senate I think the the
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
feeling was in helping Human Services
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
that we don't currently share
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
information with other states and this
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
was really a sort of getting ahead of
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
yourself sort of situation although very
 
00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
important for privacy and to rec
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
recognized article 2B of the
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution that it was sort of you
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
know sort of more than what we do right
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
now happy always to protect privacy and
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
look at that in the future but the
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
Senate the senate committee decided to
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
um hold it either for further review or
 
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
revisit it in the fall um so that's kind
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
of where we are and that's kind of the
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
synopsis of our work on
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
it um yes my further question would be
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
um um just when that change was made
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
because as of the middle of April um
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
we're still moving forward with the
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
intention to um so the specific language
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm concerned about here so that
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what in the world I'm
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
talking about that would probably
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
help if I don't know if you want to look
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
at the form or if you want to look at
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
the rules they both have the same
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
page oop sorry I deleted that part so
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
let's go into the form and the
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
conditional approval that is on page 12
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
of the document the um IIs form that we
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
had referenced previously um initially
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
um the department was looking to add a
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
bullet saying I understand that unless
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise indicated on this withdrawal
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
form the department will notify any
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
other state territory jurisdiction who
 
00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
received transmission of immunization
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
information from the nhis to ensure
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
deletion of immunization information
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
sent by the nhis and from the other
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
state territory jurisdictions IIs and
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
then it had a check box to notify that
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
um there is is the 1 2 3 4 fifth bullet
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
in the acknowledgement that had been
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
removed uh because that was stating that
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
it would not otherwise be
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
withdrawn so my understanding of the
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
policy was that we weren't going to
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
share it without the ability to follow
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
the intention of the legislature in
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
regards to the withdrawal and I'm trying
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
to understand when this change in
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it happened and if
 
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:23.720 align:start position:0%
that was communicated to the Senate and
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
if that's part of why it was inter room
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
studied or if this was just simply mised
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
commmunication because quite honestly we
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
worked on so many things and worked on
 
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
so many things together this year that I
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
understand that you may have thought
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
that a conversation happened that didn't
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
because I thought there were
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
conversations that happened that didn't
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
because we were all trying to keep up
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
with the Bill Volume so if it just
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
simply was an oversight that's one thing
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious if that was
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
communicated to the Senate since it was
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
not communicated to the house so right
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
so when we when the bill got to the
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
Senate we testified on the bill and um
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
was basically they said that we didn't
 
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
think this was ready for prime time and
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
obviously because we don't the
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
department doesn't currently share with
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
other states we assured the committee
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
members that we would certainly work to
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
um protect privacy but at this point
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
they thought that we we don't do it
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
already and if we did do it then we
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
could address it but to put an
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
appropriation in for something that we
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
don't currently do seemed to be not a
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
good use of funds during this non-budget
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
year so they put it in a ter study to
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
review it in the fall and at that point
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
I think we felt that we would not be
 
00:16:30.749 --> 00:16:30.759 align:start position:0%
able to to carry out the rule language
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
without that funding for the position
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
and the needed upgrade to the system
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we provided in our testimony so if
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
there was a lack of communication on
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
that we we certainly apologize but um
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
the the way that it worked in the Senate
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that my understanding is we
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
did not testify that it would be in rule
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
is that we were looking at it um and uh
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
and apologize for any miscommunication
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
but certainly if we were to share to
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
other states that I think we would be
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
happy to make those changes and accept
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations to have that uh
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
structure in place to do that but we
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
don't currently share any information
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
with other states and that was a
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
decision that the the Senate HHS made to
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
put it in interm study to wait so that's
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's my update if I can follow up um
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a lot of
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
discussion that still needs to happen on
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
this since we're not sharing with any
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
other states would it make sense to
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
strike the language and the fifth bullet
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
point um so that the form is silent on
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from other states because it
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're setting a policy here
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
about not withdrawing um from other
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
states so to me it seems more
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward to strike that language
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
since we aren't sharing with other
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
states why are we putting it in our
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
disclosures at this point would that be
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um I can also find where it
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
would be in the rules specifically but
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
it would be the fifth bullet point on
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
the form on page 12 of conditional
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
approval so prior in prior to sharing
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
any information we would enter into anou
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
with the other state we would be vetting
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
them we would be reviewing their systems
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
their processes to make sure that
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
there's privacy confidentiality and
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
security um that bullet is placed there
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so that way in the event that the
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
information is not coming to New
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for withdrawal it it it just
 
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
is looking at who is responsible for
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
holding that withdrawal that statement
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
is there so that a person knows that
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
when they're withdrawing if their
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
information is in another state they
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
should contact that State directly that
 
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal from another state would
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
not be performed under New Hampshire
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that state
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
Appropriations or the position to
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
perform that function as you recall for
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature there was funding that
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
would need to be upgrading the um IIs
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
system that was a New Hampshire specific
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
enhancement because there's not normally
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
any transaction log of where a
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
recipient's information would be going
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
this was putting the onus of that back
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
onto the individual who has consented to
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
share their information and has full
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge that their information may be
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
shared with another state so that way if
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
they do change their mind at a later
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
point they can contact that other state
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
directly because that function would not
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
be performed by New Hampshire unless
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
those State Appropriations were
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
made as a followup sure I just want to
 
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm clear on what what you
 
00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
just said we have a little Catch 22 I
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
think um where you're saying we don't
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
currently share any information with any
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
state but here we're saying that but if
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
we do in the future it's now the
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
patient's responsibility to chase it
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
down um they don't necessarily have to
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
be chasing it down I think most
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
individuals know if they've received a
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination or medical care in another
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
state so you know if they are uh you
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
know residing halftime in Florida they
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
would just contact the Florida Ias so
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of chasing down state
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
by state by state because that
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
information would only go to that state
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
which they received care so that
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
individual would have that information
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
that process for New Hampshire to track
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
down where an individual any individual
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
who with withdraws that that would be
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
very expensive to do compared to an an
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
individual taking the matter into their
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
own hands because they're maintaining
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
their own records and the refusal for
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
the other seat um thank you I thought
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
that one of the reasons why the New
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I may exchange the
 
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
immunization information with other
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
states is for the purpose of ensuring
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
the completeness of the record that's
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
correct so that seems different than
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
getting a vaccination in another state
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore bringing it into the state
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
that seems like an entirely different
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
purpose to me so a complete record would
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
be pulling if if an individual has
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
consented to participate in our system
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
and they've received vacc inations in
 
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the Massachusetts system
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
does not talk to New Hampshire unless we
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
enacted Theseus to do that exchange of
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
information so a you know an individual
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
who's in our system who's a New
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident would have a
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
massachusett vaccination record but
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
their address would be New Hampshire so
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
if they have a New Hampshire residence
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
and were vaccinated in Massachusetts
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
that information then could sent be sent
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
over that what that does is that builds
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
that person's record to make it more
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
complete because otherwise the um system
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be missing that information when
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
they were vaccinated in another state
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that would work uh reciprocally a
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
followup so um if the purpose of
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring the completeness of record is
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of vaccination immunizations
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
received outside the state can we on
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
page five um item
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
seven add to the statement of of the
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
exchanging the information for the
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
purposes of ensuring completeness of
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
record um in regards to immunizations
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
obtained in other states and territories
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
because otherwise that language is very
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
very broad if the intention is that it's
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
only to pull in immunization information
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
happening outside of New Hampshire that
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
should be clarified in the rules I'm
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't know if it's on our page
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
five sorry s it is I'm sorry it's on
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
page five of the conditional approval
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
requests sure um
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
do you know what letter or
 
00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:35.350 align:start position:0%
do you know what letter or
3076

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
3076
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
30706 uh number H7 H7 H7 oh
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so and it's a second line
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
of seven to add for the purposes of
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
ensuring the completeness of record of
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
immunizations received outside of the
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry can you please repeat what
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
you were looking to amend between record
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
and the period at the end of that
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
sentence I would insert the phrase of
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
immunizations received outside of the
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair wouldn't that also exclude any
 
00:23:49.029 --> 00:23:49.039 align:start position:0%
um immunizations that were received in
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire then so I'm
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
I'm worried that that language would be
 
00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.149 align:start position:0%
I'm worried that that language would be
too

00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
exclusive for instance if you know a
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
resident moved to Massachusetts and
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to include their IM immunization
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
records to Massachusetts for the
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
immunizations they received in New
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you amended the language to
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
say only the immunizations received
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
outside the state of New Hampshire then
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
folks who used to live in New Hampshire
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to share their
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
information to the new state if you
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
excluded that so I'm just a little
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
concerned Mr chair um thank you for that
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at the third sentence in
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
that which is on the Fifth Line it says
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
that in the event that the registrant
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
receives medical treatment that would
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
have prompted retrieval so that already
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
covers that case and this already covers
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
the case of receiving a medical
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
treatment out of the state so the
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
language of for the purposes of ensuring
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
completeness of the record period is a
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
very very broad statement and if it's
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
intended to capture immunizations
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
clarified well I think that that that
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
was included because it does state that
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
you know if they're
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
participating they allow the transfer
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
immunization from another state into the
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
IAS so if they were vaccinated out of
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
the state that would come into the
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
IAS and if they were receiving medical
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
care or vaccination in another state it
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
would go to that other State's IAS so
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
seeing what you're asking in the
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
relevance um then can we strike for the
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
purposes of ensuring completeness of the
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
record because that to me reads much
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
broader than the following sentences so
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
if we ended the first sentence right
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
parenthesis I don't think it would
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
change the context of the intention of
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
what we were doing by striking that I
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
mean that the purpose is to get a to
 
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
have the most complete record for
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
patient so that they have a Consolidated
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
record no matter where they received
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
their vaccinations and that that record
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
can travel with
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
them thank you um if that's acceptable
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
I'll see where else that falls in the
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
rules because I think that line may be
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
repeated and I'll pull that up I don't
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
know if anybody else has any questions
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
but so let's back up so your request is
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
on line number seven at the end of um
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
where it says um information
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
immunization system and I in Brackets
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
put a period there and strike for the
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of uring complete completeness
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
of record strike those last 1 2 3 four
 
00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:35.799 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight words correct and
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
is and the Department's position on
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
striking those eight words yes or no it
 
00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:47.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter I think striking it here
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes if there's further revision I I
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
think we would request to review
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
whatever revisions were being requested
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay I'm scanning right now to see okay
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's already been OC in here so thank
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair could I ask what the
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
concerns are with this with this type of
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
review of the rules I'm not quite sure
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
since what's being requested was put an
 
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
interim study and the rules reflect that
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand the
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
concern sure um um you want to answer
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
you want me to my concern is that I have
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
been working with the Department to
 
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
resolve numerous questions that have
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
been raised at the October hearing um in
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of doing that they had moved
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
towards adopting adopting the language
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
that I was interested in in that bill
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
however that is based upon the fact that
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of data creep right now
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
with hippo things they can Market to you
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
based on your medical conditions and I
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
don't know that that was necessarily
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
intended making sure that our language
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
is and tight and concise and that the
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
per for the purposes of completeness of
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
the record refers to the individual's
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
record as opposed to the greater public
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
health record where we were able to
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
basically combine all of the state's IIs
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
systems which would be permitted with
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
that language um I think is absolutely
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
critical because we're here looking at
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
protecting the health of granite Staters
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to become part of a
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
large 50 state repository where we're
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
continually washing our data with other
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
states because that would be an entirely
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
different purpose than what the
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
legislature created the I
 
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
for so this protects against that
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
Creed yes but the agency has said they
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't share that data so we don't
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
participate in that I guess I'm just
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that you're you're you're
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
stating the house position but then the
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
Senate stated their position and it does
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
we have so perhaps the question might be
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
so again I I think that uh just to be
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
clear and I'll go to representative
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
moral in just one second is right now we
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
have an a request to just strike some
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
words that are causing represent concern
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
based on what went on the agencies
 
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
agreed to it and said it's okay that
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the content of what they
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
were intending to do um so that's where
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
we're currently standing um but director
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
Morel has a something he lik to uh thank
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
you because representative Lon has
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
indicated there are other places which
 
00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
have the same or similar language uh
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's the committee could continue this
 
00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
to the next regular meeting with without
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
a waiver and uh give time to find out
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
exactly where the other sports are if
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
that language is identical and give the
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
agency a little more time to determine
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
determination but that's up to the
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
committee um I've done my search and
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
that is actually the only time that
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
phrase appears I just wanted to make
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
sure we weren't removing it one place
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
and leaving it
 
00:29:53.679 --> 00:29:55.389 align:start position:0%
and leaving it
elsewhere

00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay further discussion
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
can I can I just represent l so I have
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
to say I I am not into the weeds of this
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
at all but what I am concerned about is
 
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.630 align:start position:0%
at all but what I am concerned about is
it

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
appears that what representative L was
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
saying was that as this matter was going
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and if
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
I'm misinterpreting this represent
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
please correct me but it appears that as
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
this matter was going through the
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
legislative process if I understand
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
resentative lon's uh point is that she
 
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
was told by the agency well this really
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary to deal with this
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
through legislation we can't handle it
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
through the administrative process um
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
and and and we'll do that and then it
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
turns out that the bill is goes to
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
interim study in the Senate perhaps for
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
that same reason because it's you know
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
something that that the legislature
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
believes or the Senate believes could be
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
handled through legislative process and
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
then when we get the legisl when we get
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
the regulations they don't address it
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
and that's if that's true that's a I
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
mean that's a real concern because it
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
seems like and I I don't you know lay
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
this on any particular individual but it
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
seems like there's been sort of a
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation to the legislature
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
about well we'll be able to do this
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process and then
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's not done and I think if that's if
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's the you know the fact that really
 
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
is a concern
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I can
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
address that a bit I think to shed some
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
light on this so the first time that we
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
had um discussed with representative Lon
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
that there she was interested in putting
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislation forward was that the rules
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the public hearing for this Rule
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
and we said oh yeah we're happy to talk
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
with you about your concern certainly we
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
take legislator's concerns very
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
seriously um we uh understood she was
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
going to file a piece of legislation
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
which she did
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
1669 which is which she represented I
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
think it was the first part of her bill
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
was filed we met with her in January to
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
discuss her concerns related to the rule
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
um looked went over the bill language
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
and looked at what we might be able you
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
know to do to accommodate uh concerns we
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
like to meet with legislators I mean the
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
whole time we were saying that we don't
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
currently share information with other
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
states if we do share with information
 
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
with other states you know certainly we
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
could make these changes um I think we
 
00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
represented fairly that um we were open
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
to you know understanding concerns
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the you know the the
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
provision of privacy um the bill we met
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
with her we we reviewed the language the
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
bill was filed um we testified at all
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
the hearings we went to finance in which
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
Finance put in um some position funding
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
for positions to update the system at a
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
cost of $80,000 for a onetime up upgrade
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
you know taxpayer funds to to make this
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
change for something that we don't
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
currently do it's a practice we don't do
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
if we do do it that would be one thing
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
but we we don't currently share
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
information with other states there was
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
also a I'm sorry but can I just have to
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
interrupt just for a second so
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
did so I was understanding that and and
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
again maybe this is just a
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding on my part but that
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
that what representative Leon was told
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
by HHS was
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
um your concerns are legitimate concerns
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
and we will address it in the in the
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
regulations as opposed to what you seem
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
to be saying now is no there's no need
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
to address this in the legislation
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
because in the regulations because we
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't share information with any other
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
states anyway so there's no need for
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
this and those are two I think two very
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
different things yeah I don't think
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
there there was I mean from our
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
perspective and we our B Team met you
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
know with legislators all the time there
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
was no misrepresentation on our part
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with legislators we
 
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
don't currently do the practice if
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
somebody files a bill and wants to you
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
know impose something upon our agency
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to testify in the bill we're
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
going to say what we do do what we don't
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
do what we can do you know we can do it
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
if there's funding to for the position
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
and the upgrade but certainly there was
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
no misrepresentation the Senate um
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
dispensed with the bill into interim
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
study I think the Department's position
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
is here we are talking about this the
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
the current legislation that was filed
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
is an interim study meaning in the fall
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
when the Senate HHS committee meets they
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
could look at the bill and say oh you
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
know let's make some changes to this
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
that will require additional room making
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
which require us to come back so right
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
now we would rather wait we're H this is
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
important issue absolutely but it's not
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time we want to wait and
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
see what the Senate decides and the
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
senate committee if they're additional
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
changes to the system to the then we're
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
back here again and so we said well
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
we'll take it out of the rule we'll come
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
back and we're happy to address it but
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
we don't it's not a practice we do if we
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
do do it we need the position the
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
upgrade and all of the things but I
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
think we've ascertained here that we're
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
you know trying to be transparent and do
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done it is not
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
something that we currently do um if we
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
were to do it there's some further
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
things that need to be worked out so
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
apologies on miss any misrepresentation
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
on that but that was how our team viewed
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
it collaboratively working and I did
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
send um the rules to representative land
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
three or four times for review and you
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
know at the last minute with the busy
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
session didn't get any response back on
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
those so you know just don't want to put
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
blame but like we're we're just trying
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
to get it everybody Happy on on what
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing but this isn't a practice we
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
currently do and happy to look into it
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
for but cently we don't um thank you on
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
the April 17th copy of the rules it
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
still included the language about the
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
withdrawal but moving outside of this
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
let's look at how we're moving forward
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
should I expect a budget request for
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
this position so that we will be
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
prepared should the department enter
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
into um any M us so that we then don't
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
have to do that out of the budget cycle
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
or will that not be coming in the next
 
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
budget cycle we would need to put in
 
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
state Appropriations if we were charged
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
with insuring ing that withdrawal and
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
doing that work themselves um once again
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
I think the option that would not cost
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire any dollar would be for an
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
individual to be informed of how their
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
information would be handled they would
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
have the choice to participate or not
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
participate and if they chose to
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
participate they would know that where
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
they got care or vaccinations they would
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
have to contact if they chose to
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
withdraw from that other state you know
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
for for New Hampshire maybe a person has
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
permanently moved to Florida and they
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
want to keep their information in
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
Florida this is saying the department is
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
forced to do that withdrawal so we're we
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
may potentially be withdrawing
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
information that the person did not want
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
to remove so I think that we have to
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
look at this very carefully if who
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
should bear the the responsibility for
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
performing that withdrawal is that a
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
task of the department or would we be
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
able to throughou have stipulations in
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
theou that said that you know this other
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
state would honor a person's request if
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
they made a request to New Hampshire
 
00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
maybe they could just accept the New
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire form so I think it's just a
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
matter of where that responsibility lies
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
and the dollar amount if you're asking
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be responsible for it
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's very few people
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
that do change their mind especially
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
after you know informed consent where
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
where they know that they have the right
 
00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
to say no I don't want my information to
 
00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
go in because it could go to another
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
state I think that's those are the
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
details that we need to work out which
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
is why you know waiting for any further
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
rule change makes sense until we have
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
that interim study so we can have these
 
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.550 align:start position:0%
that interim study so we can have these
full

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
discussions soes I just suggest you
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
support the go to the interim study
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
committee report meeting when it happens
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
and make sure your voice is heard so the
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the future
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislature would be known okay thank
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
you and I'll make sure I'll make sure to
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
request that I'm notified of when they
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
meet for the that interim study thank
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
you so I'd entertain a motion to
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve of the edits
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
that's been approved by the agency is
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
there a motion so moved it's been moved
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
by representative Leon second to approve
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
condition approv with the edits that the
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
agencies agreed to on um rule 23 1994
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
any further discussion see n all those
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
in favor signify by saying I I all those
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
opposed nay the eyes have it the rule is
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
adopted thank you
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
ladies next up is the boxing and
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission we'll take up
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
23280 uh permits and licenses For
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
Fighting uh Sports and
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
competitions so I have no substantive
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
comments on this role there's only a
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
need for legislation comment so the
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
issue is the boxing and wrestling
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
commission still has fee Authority Under
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
RSA uh
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
28513 and r a 28410 where it sets the
 
00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
promoter permits at $100 for each day
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
for the event um however the
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility for administration of the
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
licenses and uh was transferred to the
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
oplc pursuant to HB
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
279-282 but no changes were made to
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
28513 and so um we are recommending that
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendments are made to that statute that
 
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
would clarify that the commission no
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
longer has Fe
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
Authority which is consistent with the
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
other boards and so this this will just
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
be something someone needs to pick up
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
next year to deal with um the statute
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
because generally we don't set fees
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
directly in a rule like this we have a
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
fee schedule that is managed by oplc as
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
a whole not the board that manages the
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
event so there'll be future legislation
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
necessary to clean this up but we still
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
need the rule to move forward that's
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
correct so um and were there any minor
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
edits that were done that we need to
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve with edit um this
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
is an amended conditional approval I'm
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
sorry this was an amended cenal approval
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what you would be voting on
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
great any further discussion on rule uh
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
23280 seeting down and entertain a
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
approve second been mooved by
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
representative second by represent gr to
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
approve rule 23280 any further
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing done all those in
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
favor signify by saying I I all those
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
opposed name I have it the rules
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
approved next up is Rule 23282 ethical
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
standards so this is similar um 285 for
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
the boxing and wrestling commission just
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
does not clearly specify that there are
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
um Authority for ethics rules um they in
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
the rule they site to RSA 15a 15b and
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
RSA 21
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
G27 so what we think is is that the the
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 285 which is for the the commission
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be adjusted to include those
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
citations so that they can have the
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
authority to make ethics
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
discussion so uh the i' entertain a
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
motion to approve uh rule 282 as
 
00:41:20.829 --> 00:41:20.839 align:start position:0%
written moov by representative Leon
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
second by representative hacken Phillips
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
at any further
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
discussion all those in favor signified
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
by saying I I as oppose nay and director
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
moral you'll make a note that the
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
legislative update so at the end of the
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
year we have our list of future
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
bills next up is the Department of
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
Safety uh talking about the northern
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
border Alliance program under rule
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
2447 yes sir um there is one substantive
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
comment um and that is because the
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
interor roles expired on May 29th and
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see that comment on the top of um
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
page one of the rule which is page five
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the PDF packet the agency did request
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
a waiver of the 21 day deadline to file
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
the final proposal for this proposal a
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
couple of days before the meeting in May
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um they were trying to get these rules
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
adopted before the interim rules expired
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
on May uh 29th but the waiver was denied
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
due to lack of notice like I said they
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
filed it two days before that main
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
meeting but um the Jael car may have
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
some questions about uh the operation of
 
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
the grant uh since the Endor rules
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
expired on May 29th um there's really no
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
um enforcement but you may have some
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
questions around that operation of the
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
grant um there's one other comment
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
further down on page nine but um that
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
comment has been resolved I noted that
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the cover memo to the proposal um we
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
spoke with David Hilt and he let us know
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
that this grant really isn't competitive
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
it's first come first served and so
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
think that the uh qualifications or the
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
requirements in the rule are are good
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
enough for the non-competitive nature of
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
the grant funding but anyway that's the
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
only issue is that the en rules expired
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
on May
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
29th thank you very much so for those of
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
us that been on the committee you know
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
when we have expired rules one of the
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
things we always talk about is fees and
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement but in this case there are
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
no fees and enforcement so there is no
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
real implication other than they didn't
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
have rules for a certain period of time
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
but Captain if you want to say anything
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
you're welcome or or sir thank you sir
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
I'll leave the uh the wiser and better
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to the two of us to speak unless
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
he call from
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
me any discussion on the northern border
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
Alliance rule
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
2447 iate a motion to approve don't move
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
good move by representative Liv second
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
by representative Lon to approve rule
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
2447 any further
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all those in
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
favor signify by saying I I well as
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
opposed nay the eyes have it rule 2447
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
is approved moving on to
 
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
246 various carnal and amusement rules
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm also going to ask you to
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
speak about um the emergency rule that
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
goes along with this consecutively so
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
you don't have to come back under other
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
business so okay so um there are just
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
two issues to bring to the committee's
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
attention on um on these rules um it is
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
an in room Rule and they were put
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
forward to um to minimize the time
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
period of expiration the rules expired
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
on January
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
21st um so initially when they filed um
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
they just filed them just without
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
changes in order to get those rules uh
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
back into place and um but we did have
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
some comments on it so they did file a
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
conditional approval to address those
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
comments and um as uh the chair
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
indicated there are uh some um there is
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
a set of emergency rules that are
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
different they deal with other various
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
carnival amusement rules so my
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the um agency was
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
bringing those forward in an emergency
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
basis because they need those in place a
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
little sooner than they do with the
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
interim rules but um like I said the
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
only comments we had are that the rules
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
good morning attorney Dave hiltz for the
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety um we're happy to
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
entertain any specific questions the the
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee has um depending on what the
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
question is um I have Deputy State Fire
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
Marshall Mitch Katy um and also Chief
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
Inspector Briggs Lockwood and myself and
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
so we're happy to field any questions
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
that you have in particular so just I'm
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
GNA talk about the interim rule first um
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
so again you understand the inter R
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
expired we need we need a rule in place
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
because we have county fairs starting up
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the summer and we need these kind
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
of regulations in place to make sure the
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
safety of our citizens and the emergency
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
rule piece is strictly that is it you
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
need it in something in place right now
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
without public hearing order to deal
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
with the safety of the citizens for the
 
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
summer but you will go through
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately rulemaking process to resolve
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
that that is correct okay so we to talk
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
about uh so iate a motion to approve I'm
 
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:20.839 align:start position:0%
sorry is there any further
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
discussion Iain a motion to approve
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
inter room rule
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%

I'll second second by represent of Grove
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
to proove inimum rule uh
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
24-6 any further discussion seeing on
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
all those in favor signified by saying I
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
I all oppos n guys have it thank you
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
gentlemen just to clarify that was for
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
conditional approval I'm sorry just to
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
clarify was for conditional approval
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
conditional approval on on number 26
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
because it's an inter
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
rule Thank you very much thank you and
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
there's no action to be taken out of the
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
emergency rule it's informational
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
only next up is
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
2450 uh so for this rule the department
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
did file a revised amended conditional
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
approval that addressed all of staff's
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
comments however this was kept on the
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
regular agenda because there is an
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
informational note to the committee at
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
47.1 a those subparagraphs have
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
specific numbers for which uh Timber can
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
be cut and those numbers are found in
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
the statute however the numbers in this
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
proposal reflect the new uh excuse me
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
the amended statute which was SB 514
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
which will take effect July
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
1st so as long as the agency does not ad
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
adopt and make effective these rules
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
before July 1st they will be fine I have
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
talked to the agency they have agreed so
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
I would recommend that the committee do
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval with the
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
understanding that these rules will
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
become effective on or after July 1st
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so again to make the committee
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
clear we passed a law last year and we
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
also passed a law this year they
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
Incorporated both laws into the new rule
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
but obviously the new the one we just
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
passed doesn't take effect till July 1
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
so they have a rule for a law we haven't
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's not effective yet so we're asking
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the motion I'm hoping will be that
 
00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
we conditionally approve understanding
 
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
that we hold off implementation of the
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
rule until July one so that it it can
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
cover both make move has been moved by
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative Subs conditionally
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
approved and seconded by representative
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
grassy any further discussion other than
 
00:48:49.549 --> 00:48:49.559 align:start position:0%
we passed another law you'll be looking
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
at this rule again just to let you know
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
um so any further discussion all those
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
in favor signify by saying I I all is
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
opposed nay the eyes have it 2450 is
 
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:02.870 align:start position:0%
opposed nay the eyes have it 2450 is
conditionally

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
conditionally
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
approved next up is uh
 
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
2466 uh so the agency did file a
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request for this
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
proposal it did address a majority of
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the comments from the final proposal
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
however there are still a few that
 
00:49:26.359 --> 00:49:27.230 align:start position:0%
however there are still a few that
remain

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh one of which is a result actually of
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval uh so the first
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
comment is on page six of the
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request text um it
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
references in paragraph B A scoring
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
Matrix and then lists 12 requirements
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
that the Matrix shall have however if
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
you then look at paragraph C it says
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
that the score Matrix shall demonstrate
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
um or it's it's a demonstration I think
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
of what a scoring Matrix will look like
 
00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
which isn't exactly a requirement but it
 
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
then states that there are four
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and assigns points to those
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
four requirements set points within the
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
rule so it's kind of unclear about how
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
the agency is going to assign points to
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
the other eight requirements that were
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
in paragraph B and if the four
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
requirement that do have the set points
 
00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
if that's going to be a set for all
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
applications or if if it's just a
 
00:50:36.549 --> 00:50:36.559 align:start position:0%
demonstration it really shouldn't be in
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
the rules at all it
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
should it's not a rule if it's a
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
demonstration uh the next comment is on
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
page eight um and this is the one where
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
the agency changed the language in the
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
conditional approval previously on the
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
final proposal they had stated that
 
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.390 align:start position:0%
final proposal they had stated that
municipality

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
could not enter contracts with related
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
or Affiliated contractors for materials
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
labor or Services unless they
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that the contracts were
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
fair and competitive on the final
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
proposal I made a comment asking that
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
they create more criteria or more
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
examples of what municipality had to
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
provide in order to demonstrate that the
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
contracts were fair and competitive and
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
then additionally put in the
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
rules what the process was should there
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
be a disagreement between the agency and
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
the municipality on what is fair and
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
competitive uh what the agency then did
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
was they simply struck the language that
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
the municipality need to demonstrate
 
00:51:45.069 --> 00:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
that the contracts are fair and
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
competitive so now it just reads that
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities cannot enter contracts at
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
all with related or Affiliated
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
contractors which potentially could be
 
00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:57.829 align:start position:0%
contractors which potentially could be
fiscal

00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
impact change that they would need a
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
revised FIS for because they had
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
previously given a benefit to these
 
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:08.200 align:start position:0%
contractors under this a um grant
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
program and now they are taking that
 
00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
benefit away so there is a potential
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact there and there's also a
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
potential fiscal impact on the
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities if they can no longer use
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
contractors who they are affiliated or
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
related with they would then have to go
 
00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:23.799 align:start position:0%
and find other contractors which could
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
result in a increased or decreased
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
um so that is the only two comments I
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
had on that
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
proposal thank you um do you want to
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
speak to what they did sure thank you
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
very much Chase Hegman uh director of
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
the division of economic development at
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
Bea I just want to start by saying the
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
OS team has been incredibly helpful in
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
this process so thank you for all your
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
feedback and input uh and I'll say the
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh the department agrees um with the
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
with the assessment um as pertains to
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
section 6 405 B and C uh with the Matrix
 
00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799 align:start position:0%
concern um I think there's just a little
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
confusion on what was intended uh in
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
that language the um criteria the 12
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
criteria in section B is uh I would
 
00:53:14.789 --> 00:53:14.799 align:start position:0%
describe more as um uh principles or uh
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
explanation of the subsequent specific
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
the four scored categories so I think
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
the um what the department would propose
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
would be to effectively truncate that
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
section into the Matrix um as they as
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
those um uh principles relate to each
 
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:31.160 align:start position:0%
Matrix criteria that are already scored
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
so effectively moving and I've already
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
numbered them but the the the numbered
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh criteria would simply be collapsed
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
into uh what would what is currently
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
section c within the appropriate uh
 
00:53:42.799 --> 00:53:44.750 align:start position:0%
section c within the appropriate uh
Matrix

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
Matrix
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
criteria and to the second comment
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
around municipalities the second comment
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
um the the department also agrees uh and
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
I think it was sort of a circumstance
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
where the baby was thrown out with the
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
bath water uh and over correction uh so
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
we would recommend adding the language
 
00:54:01.309 --> 00:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
back in where municipalities are able to
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
have um Affiliated and related
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
contractors um and we'd work with OS in
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
the best language for that but our
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that the
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
municipality and developer would have to
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the contract that's
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
engaged in is uh effectively uh meeting
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
industry standards and best practices uh
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
and we can work with the with OS on on
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
what that language would look
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
like thank you so my concern again on a
 
00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:27.799 align:start position:0%
municipal piece especially in small
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
towns you may have a developer who was
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
also a contracted uh plow operator
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
during the winter right or or or does
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
construction work on the side of the
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
roads you know to do culverts and and
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
those kind of things in small towns and
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
the language you presented would say
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
they could no longer do business and
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
with that contractor at all if they're
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
also involved in an invest in h project
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
as well sure so that's my concern with
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
the language as I read it so I'd hope
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
you address that so I think the answer
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
would be is there any further discussion
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
around this so I think the answer is to
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary object let them go back
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
correct the problems we've identified in
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
B and C as well as this municipality
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
language and they can bring back the the
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh response that we
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
get I'm make before we make that motion
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I'm right on the
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection is the right
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
motion um yes that is certainly an
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
option um that the agency could do to
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
correct that the other option
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
potentially would be just to postpone uh
 
00:55:30.789 --> 00:55:30.799 align:start position:0%
this till the next meeting to allow the
 
00:55:32.829 --> 00:55:32.839 align:start position:0%
agency to file an amended conditional
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
approval if they're willing to work on
 
00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
those issues um it wouldn't need a
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
waiver as the deadline for the committee
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
is until July
 
00:55:44.349 --> 00:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
30th um but if it's going to need some
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
extensive work a preliminary objection
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
also would be uh appropriate to allow
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
them to work through it in a response I
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
think we'll just postpone it for now if
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
if everyone's okay I'm move their postp
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
we'll do the second so a move to
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
postpone second invite represent Smith
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
to postpone rule uh 2466 until the next
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
meeting any further discussion all those
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
in favor of postponement say I I all
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
those oppos nay eyes have it it's
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
postponed until next meeting 2466 next
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
up is uh 2467 the housing Champion
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
program uh so once again the agency did
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
file a conditional approval that
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
addressed uh a majority of comments on
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
the final proposal
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
um these are brand new programs so there
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
was a lot to work through um and the
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
agency was able to do that in a short
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
amount of time as they only filed these
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
rules with our office in April so they
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
have definitely been doing a lot of work
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
on these rules um but there are still a
 
00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
couple issues remaining with regard to
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
unclear comments on the way that the
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
certain sections and paragraphs are
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
written uh so the first is on page seven
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the conditional approval request text
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
there's an unclear comment um
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
on Bea
 
00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.230 align:start position:0%
on Bea
50405

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
50405
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
C3 because the language does not follow
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
the introductory language in C which
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
essentially makes it a bit confusing
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
because the introductory language talks
 
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.549 align:start position:0%
because the introductory language talks
about

00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities shall demonstrate the
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
following but then paragraph three talks
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
about in order to receive points the
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
municipality shall provide a copy of
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
relevant section so that paragraph
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
should not be a sub paragraph in that
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
section it really needs to be moved
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
either incorporated into a different
 
00:57:37.029 --> 00:57:37.039 align:start position:0%
section or made its own paragraph the
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
next one is on page 14 another unclear
 
00:57:40.319 --> 00:57:41.430 align:start position:0%
next one is on page 14 another unclear
comment

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
because the way the paragraph is worded
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
it says shall meet the definition
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
outlined in 504 .08 b 2 and
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
3 that section is the section
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
immediately above and it's not a
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
definition it's more of uh conditions
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
that need to be met in order to receive
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
these points these scoring points um so
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
that language needs to be changed uh to
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
clarify that that's not a definition uh
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
confusion uh the next one is also on
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
page 14 more toward the bottom uh
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph D4 it's unclear as
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
written because the way it's worded is
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
whether a project has entered into
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
public private Partnerships but a
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
project cannot enter into a partnership
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
unclear who the agency actually intended
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
one entering into these public private
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
Partnerships so that needs to be
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
clarified next is on page 17 there's an
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
unclear because the agency did not
 
00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
include a conjunction at the end of the
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
last subparagraph
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
and because of the way it's written it's
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
really could be an and or an or so it's
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
un usually we can make an inference of
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
whether it should be an or or an and but
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
in this particular instance it could be
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
either so the agency really needs to
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
clarify which one it actually
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
intended on page
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
18 uh another unclear comment uh because
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph D it's a it's an incomplete
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
sentence all it says is bonus points um
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
and then additionally there are sub
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
paragraphs under D so it's also lacking
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
introductory language for those
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
subparagraphs so that one needs quite a
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
bit of work page 28 there's another
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
unclear comment uh because the language
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
says this rules so it's unclear if the
 
00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
agency intended to say these rules or
 
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:46.270 align:start position:0%
agency intended to say these rules or
this

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
Rule and finally on page 34 um this
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
one's actually an authority legislative
 
00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
intent comment because the agency after
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
it Awards these grants they then have to
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
enter into agreements with the awardees
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
to lay out the conditions and what the
 
01:00:11.309 --> 01:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
awarde will do um and under RSA 541
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
A14 these are technically considered
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
rules however the committee has taken
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
VAR positions in the past on these types
 
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
of agreements or essentially
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
contracts um and so it's really up to
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
the committee whether or not they would
 
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
want these written out as rules or if
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
they would um simply allow the agency to
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
reference them as agreements um
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
additionally with regard to this rule
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
set specifically there's also additional
 
01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
oversight on these agreements because
 
01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:43.799 align:start position:0%
the awards will be uh approved by the
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive Council so
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's also that additional oversight
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to these agreements um but
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
once again this is one where you could
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
either issue a preliminary objection and
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
allow the agency to file a response to
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
address these unclear or if the agency
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
is willing to work with us and file an
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval you could
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
also postpone this one uh without a
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
waiver uh to the next meeting to allow
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
the agency to do that I'm going to
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
recommend we postpone till next meeting
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
give them time to work with the uh with
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
the staff to clear up all the unclear
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
comments and uh and go forward but
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
before we make that motion um there's a
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
a question I just want to make sure that
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to address all
 
01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
that before we before we meet again
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of stuff there I
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
agree um and I appreciate um the staff
 
01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:39.400 align:start position:0%
pointing it out and I will say that in
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
their comments they also made
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we agree with so
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
there are suggestions in there as to
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
what the change would be and I think
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the exception of maybe one it's a
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
pretty clear pivot uh but there was some
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
language um previously um adjusted that
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think needed some more
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
clarification and discussion as well um
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
so one one point of clarification I
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
think just from the agency agency's
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
benefit we have a statutory requirement
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
to have these rules and the previous
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
rules approved by actually July 1 not
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
July 30th so I don't know if there's a
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
possibility to have any kind of
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
retroactive nature to the rules or how
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
that impacts our requirements as no we
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
we're just going to have to recognize
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that you have a deadline you're
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
not going to meet it and legislator's by
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
a vote as said this committee said we
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
understand that okay
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
so so with that if if the chair allows
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion to postpone uh been
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
motion to postpone is there a second
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
second by representative Leon all in
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
favor of postponement signify by saying
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
I oppose nay guys have it we postpone
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
till the next meeting thank you
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
gentlemen very
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
much next up is the board of
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
registration of funeral directors and
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
ERS yes um so these rules are on um
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
applications for apprentice and bommer
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
licenses um the interim rule was filed
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
to minimize the time period of the rules
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
expiration the rules expired on May 1st
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
um it was initially filed without any uh
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
changes made but there were a lot of
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
problems with the rules and that there
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
were some conflicts uh with some recent
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
statutory amendments so um the board did
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
file the conditional approval and that
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
pretty much re resolved all the issues
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
there's some minor editorial comments um
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
towards the end and um my discussion
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
with the oplc indicated that they're
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
willing to make those changes so um
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
again the um only issue is that them
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
that the rules expired on May 1st um
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
there are some fees mentioned but if you
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
recall um the PLC rules were adopted
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
last August so um that issue is
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
oplc so our obvious question is expired
 
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
rule has been any enforcement or any uh
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
fees that are governed by this rule
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's expired that uh we need that the
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
agency needs to take care of good
 
01:04:06.269 --> 01:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
morning Shantel wheeler office of
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%

01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
um I have can you yes pull the
 
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
microphone closer if you
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
will is that better wait a little bit
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I've confirmed with the um board
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
that there have not been any Apprentice
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
applications for PR and balers that have
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
been processed great thank you further
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
discussion by the committee see on
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion and conditionally
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
approve with the
 
01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
edits moved and second by represent
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
second by representative hackins
 
01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:36.279 align:start position:0%
Phillips to conditionally approve with
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
edits uh 24-4 any further discussion
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
seeing on all those in favor signify by
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
saying I I I'll oppose nay the eyes have
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
it the rules adopted um we have an
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
objection response from the board of
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
natural scientists yes sir U these are
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
on the soil 300 rules uh the proposal
 
01:05:00.269 --> 01:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
was conditionally approved at the May
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
meeting and the board's conditional
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
approval response made some changes that
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
were not included in its request and so
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
that um caused the approval to convert
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
to a preliminary OB objection the board
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
has filed an objection response as well
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
as a revised objection response which is
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
um highly unusual um it sounds like the
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
board only meets quarterly so um it
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
sounds like they filed that for
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
convenience since that board only meets
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly um typically an agency will
 
01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:33.799 align:start position:0%
ask the committee for a revised
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
objection response and then the
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
committee will approve it but it's up to
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
the committee whether or not you want to
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
approve that the revised objection
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
response you do have that linked and it
 
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:45.799 align:start position:0%
makes um some substantive changes that
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
were not in response to our comments but
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
um on the objection response itself
 
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:53.960 align:start position:0%
there is one unclear comment that you'll
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
see on the bottom of page 11
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
and that's because the language is it's
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
slightly arguable whether or not that's
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
substantive we feel like it can be
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
argued either way it pretty much does
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
the same thing that it did it's just
 
01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
rewarded um anyway we recommend that the
 
01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
committee approve the objection response
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
and again it's up to the committee
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to you know
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
discuss the revised objection response
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
or not if you want to approve it Dr Mora
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
um it's always been the history of the
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee that uh an agency cannot Act
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh on something that has not occurred
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
since the objection response since
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
the committee has not yet entertained a
 
01:06:41.069 --> 01:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
revised objection then there can't be a
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
revised objection response um I even
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
remember one instance where Dees had a
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
rulle that they definitely needed in
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
place to get Federal funding and they
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
had a deadline of the day of the jail
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
car meeting they got a preliminary
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
objection they took it back and came
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
back to the committee and got the
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
approval on it it's the same thing they
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
you can't do a second step until you've
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
done the first
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
step right so again just to be clear as
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's clear what what happened was
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
we objected to this we gave them a list
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
of things that we objected to they in
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
their first response responded to a list
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
of things we gave them and then said oh
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
by the way we also want these other
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
things and then gave us a revised
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
objection response the problem is you
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
can't do the second thing because we
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
didn't tell them to look at it as part
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
of the rule process so um so I I'm going
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
to say that the only thing that's going
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
to be put in front of us today is the
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
objection response the first that their
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
response to us and I'd ask staff
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
comments on the objection response um is
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
there anything that's still pending
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
after their
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
response uh no there is like I said
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
there's one unclear on the bottom of
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
page 11 um the rest of the comments that
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
are made are just notes to you letting
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
you know that um that those sections
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
that those places were amended but all
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
those were in response to OS comments
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
the only one is on the on that one page
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 11 of your PDF and
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
like I said um Mike and I both thought
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
that it's arguable whether or not this
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
is substantive we we think it says the
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
same thing but just in a different way
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
so um we have no other comments on this
 
01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.870 align:start position:0%
so um we have no other comments on this
objection

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
response does the board have any
 
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:26.199 align:start position:0%
comments it's Tina Kelly um program
 
01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
um specialist office of professional
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
lure certification the reason that we
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
submitted both the objection response
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
and um the revised objection response is
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
that the wrong um amended conditional
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
approval request was submitted to jail
 
01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
car previously and I had the board come
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
in and we we had planned out a way to
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
move forward to get them to where they
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
needed to be it in Alliance with the
 
01:08:54.679 --> 01:08:56.110 align:start position:0%
needed to be it in Alliance with the
correct

01:08:56.110 --> 01:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
um Revis amended conditional approval
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
response and so the board meets
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
quarterly they came in for a special
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
meeting and I felt no through no fault
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
of their own um that we would just
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
follow the plan that was laid out to get
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
these to where they needed to be in in
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
compliance with the or in alignment with
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
the amended conditional approval
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
response that was submitted by the
 
01:09:23.199 --> 01:09:25.669 align:start position:0%
response that was submitted by the
office

01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
understand that we can't do that because
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
of 541 a right so you you were
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
responding to things we didn't talk
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
about and and we didn't bring up as an
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
objection and then you put them into the
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
rule again or into the rule and by our
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
processes we can't do that so we can we
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
can we can deal with the revised
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
objection I mean the objection response
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
that you gave and we can approve that
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
but we can't have you add things after
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we didn't we didn't address so a
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
point of clarification yeah does the
 
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
board need to remet and revote on this
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
you would need to reopen rulemaking if
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not if I'm not mistaken to deal with
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
all those changes you made that were in
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
response to our our objection that's the
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct if the objection response
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
is approved by the committee then uh new
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
R making would need to be started to do
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
changes any further discussion I
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion and conditionally
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
approve the objection
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
response it's been moved by
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative grassy second by uh
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative schmith they approve the
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve with that it's the
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh objection response any further
 
01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:35.719 align:start position:0%
discussion Mr chair I think um maybe the
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
agency has additional questions do
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
confused on the process so we approving
 
01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
confused on the process so we approving
the

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
response new R making has to be started
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
to do the other things that the board
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
wants not
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
revise I
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually it's a choice of the board
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
whether they want to go through new rul
 
01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
making to implement the changes they
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
made inputed in the revised objection
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
response excuse me keep that again okay
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh you put new things in the revised
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
objection response the board did uh they
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
can't do them if they wish to implement
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
those they can do it through another rul
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
making okay but for the uh purposes of
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
today you just need to file an adoption
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
of the objection response
 
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.760 align:start position:0%

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
13984 the next two say discussion item
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
13985 uh the first of those is a
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
rejection letter that should not have a
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
document number as no document number
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
has been issued um so the uh earlier
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
this year the board filed an an
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
emergency rule
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh nursing 30105 and nursing
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
30502 um Unfortunately they did not
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
base uh the emergency rule on the most
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
recent version of the rules it was a
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
prior version um so the committee asked
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
him last month or the month before as
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually petitioned the board to uh
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
repeal that emergency rule the board did
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
that on um May 24th same day they filed
 
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
a new emergency rule
 
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.390 align:start position:0%
a new emergency rule
um

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
and the problem with this one is in
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
13052 uh the board thought the entire
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
section was currently in effect and they
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh reopt it it with Amendment they
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
struck some stuff they inserted some new
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
language unfortunately almost all of
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
well most of
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
13052 had already expired uh there were
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of subclauses and some
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
introductory language that was still in
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
effect uh because of this there are
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
u rules that were in effect that are no
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
longer in effect uh under the emergency
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
Rule and there were Provisions that uh
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
were amended that could not be amended
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
because they did not exist
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
anymore because of this lack of clarity
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
with the emergency rule I discussed with
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire and with uh director
 
01:14:14.510 --> 01:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
alukonis and I decided that a receip
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
would not be issued to the agency and a
 
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:20.679 align:start position:0%
document number would not be granted um
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
what the agency could do at this point
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
is repeal this emergency rule
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
and file a new one and we would be happy
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
to sit down with the agency to assist
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
them uh to make sure the right uh right
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%

mistake on the letter that went to them

today um it says reopt with the entirety
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
