00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everyone the time
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
being 10:17 I'm going to open the exec
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
585 and um so over the
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
past week or so uh representative uh
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
Ames and representative spillsbury have
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
worked on an amendment to SP
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
585 and
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
um right now representative spillsbury
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
is in a senate uh hearing introducing a
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
Senate bill um so we will start with um
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
representative Ames to kind of tell us
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
with okay I'll give this a try
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
um this is all uh in in many ways quite
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
straightforward um but let's see if we
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
can uh walk through it the uh the bill
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
concerns the use of a property the
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
application of a pro property lean for
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
unpaid um or un returned to Dr taxes uh
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
and this is the meals and rooms tax
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um in the previous
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
version of the
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh the uh discussion that we had uh
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
sort of centered on the wording that uh
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
identified the people who might be
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
subject to the lean and um and I think
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
we all felt that it was uh pretty fuzzy
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and might catch up some people
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
who would find themselves uh um having
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
property that was now subject to a lean
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
even though they'd had no involvement
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in the business activity that
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh led up to this um so uh we worked uh
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
together to try to uh fix that um and
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
what you have in front of you it's
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2024 1796
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
H is uh represents the our work
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
product um what we uh we we've turned
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
this around from the concept of uh
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
people who had a managerial capacity in
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
a organization that was uh the that was
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh collecting this tax and not
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
returning it to the
 
00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:35.430 align:start position:0%
returning it to the
Dr

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
um and felt uh as we thought about it
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
that that wasn't the uh right Focus
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
managerial capacity was a concept that
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
might pick up uh uh Frontline managers
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
in a Burger King for example um and uh
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
that had no no relationships at all to
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
the financial flows in the business so
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
um so the new language uh abandons the
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
concept of managerial capacity of of an
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
organization and focuses on the uh the
 
00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility the people who have
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the ta ta for the tax
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
so you see that language in in
 
00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.909 align:start position:0%
so you see that language in in
bold

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
bold
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
um starting at line
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
14 and we're defining operator to
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
include any
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
person who has actual or constructive
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
managerial or custodial responsibility
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
for the collection and transmission of
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
attacks subject to demand under this
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
chapter so that's that's the core of
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
this thing and uh people in in with that
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh would be subject to
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
the uh the lean and then an additional
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
sentence relates to we discussed sort of
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
passive owners uh wanted to be sure that
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
passive owners that uh have no no um
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
meaningful relationship to the
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
activities that uh are involved in
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
collecting and holding uh tax uh
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
revenues um would not be caught by this
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
and so um so a mere ownership interest
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered to sufficient
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
Nexus is the language that gets rid of
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
that problem I don't think it's actually
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
NE necessary one could have this bill
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
without that it's just making explicit
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
that that won't uh won't do do the trick
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of being subject to lean just
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
because you have an ownership interest
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
let's say you're a uh uh in a
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
partnership and uh you're just a uh
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
General partner without
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
managing responsibilities um that those
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
people would not be ens snared by this
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
and uh then uh we also thought we should
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
make explicit that the Department of
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration could uh could
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
lay out in rules uh the criteria that
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
might apply that would that they would
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
apply to um discern
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
which uh situations met the standard
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's in this Bill and which do not and
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
U that picks up on the list that was
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
passed To Us by Dr last time um of uh
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
the kinds of situations that should be
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
subject to um to uh s subject the person
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
to uh the the
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
lean um so that's that's basically
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's the best I can do with it and uh
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
I uh I think uh both uh representative
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and I feel good about our
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
interactions on this uh this bill we
 
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
think we've come to a good result and
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
our chair uh shephered us as we did this
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that and uh that's
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
where it lies and now we'll find out
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
whether we did indeed did did a good job
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
or not by your reaction thank you thank
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Ames I think um
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
you've spelled it out nicely and um
 
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
as you know I saw the emails going back
 
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
and forth between you and spillsbury and
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury and um and I
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
think you guys really um did a lot of
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
work and and came to a good conclusion U
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes I just have a question um
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
my one of my concerns was that a hired
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
manager somehow might be held
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
responsible and when I look at this it
 
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
seems like that would Prelude that from
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
happening do you do you think that's
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
correct I didn't I didn't hear the
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
adjective you put on the manager what
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
kind of manager h a hired
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
manager you know everything
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
turn everything is determined by what
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility the person has is not not
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
the title that will um determine that so
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
I can't answer your question without
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
knowing what the hired manager was hired
 
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.470 align:start position:0%
knowing what the hired manager was hired
for

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
and and if I remember one of the issues
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
last time was whether a member should be
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
held responsible or not and I think the
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the nice thing about this new language
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
is if you are a passive member you would
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
not be held responsible but you could
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
still be a quote member but if you've
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
got sufficient um managerial capacity or
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
um what's the word authority over this
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
then you could be held responsible so
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
this new
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
language potentially allows a member to
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
be um held responsible and I think that
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
was what um we were trying to get to so
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative ol I see you and thank
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and following up on
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative fellows the determination
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be made by DR Dr first
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
regarding construed managerial or
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
custodial responsibility before an
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
action could take place and those
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
specific terms are already predetermined
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
in G in the broad body of uh black
 
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.750 align:start position:0%
in G in the broad body of uh black
letter

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.909 align:start position:0%
letter
law

00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's a narrow field because
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's already predefined an existing law
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth yes just a
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
comment I want to go back to the
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
testimony from Dr um Al Leen is Al
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
lean's definitely a last resort and they
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
try many steps ahead of that which means
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be a surprise uh if it
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
finally gets to the lean level also
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
um this tax is collected by the business
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
for the state the money never really
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
belongs to the business in any way any
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
part of the process so again it
 
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a surprise that this money
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
is only to be delivered to the
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
state all right representative uh Aly
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes I think we're not in executive SE
 
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
session yet are we we are we are um can
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
we call uh we have represent brury back
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:32.440 align:start position:0%

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%

00:26:39.679 --> 00:26:41.269 align:start position:0%
from Dr to just say whether this
works

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:42.990 align:start position:0%
works

a very good
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
explanation as to who's responsible and
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
the last line actual or constructive
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
managerial or custodial responsibility
 
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:01.480 align:start position:0%
for the collection and transmission of
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
good job describing it is I'm confident
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%

Shen fin Capital group representing the
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%

Association and uh I think Mike and I
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
learned something this
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
morning and what we learned is that we
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
should have had representative Ames and
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
spillsbury draft the bill for us in the
 
00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:25.830 align:start position:0%
spillsbury draft the bill for us in the
first

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
instance no it uh it meets the intent of
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do that's great
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you question represent fellows so
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask the same question I
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
asked before do you think that this um
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
the way this is written will mean that
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
the responsibility won't be put on
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who who is just a hired
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
employee and not part of the LLC
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
partnership yeah I would agree with
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative am's response it really
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
depends on what the responsibility are
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
of that person if that person's
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities include preparation and
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
submission of the tax then um they would
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh be caught in the web but um that that
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
was the intent of it all along
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
so followup so even if that person is
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
just a hired employee right if they're a
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
hired employee with no involvement in
 
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
what this bill uh addressing then they
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh they wouldn't uh be uh
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
assessed the text
 
00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.350 align:start position:0%
assessed the text
she

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
she
 
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.149 align:start position:0%
she
oh

00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay representative yeah if I could just
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
try to put that in uh basic English on
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
if you are working in a convenience door
 
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
and um you are a hired employee and you
 
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
are collecting the tax as part of the
 
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.629 align:start position:0%
are collecting the tax as part of the
price

00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
on but on it is the man
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
the real manager who collects all the
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
money that you've collected and divides
 
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
it up into tax and and um money for uh
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
profit then then on you aren capable of
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
lean yes represent fellows so I think
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
part of the the problem is that I come
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
from a perspective of financial
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
accounting for nonprofits and
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
particularly school districts and that
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
even though you have a financial manager
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
who determines H how you know
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
distribution of money to pay your
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
obligations which would include this
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
there is somebody in case of uh school
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
districts in the state board that has to
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
approve those um dispersements of funds
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
and so to me the school board is
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
equivalent to the Partnerships and so
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm trying to get at
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
that you can't just you know because the
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
bookkeeper doesn't you know cut checks
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
or you know approve you know things for
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.430 align:start position:0%
or you know approve you know things for
payment

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
the bookkeeper doesn't do that somebody
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
I would think at the partnership level
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
would is that correct or corre not
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
correct so that would exclude somebody
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
who's simply an employee
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
you yes and that's why the the terms
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
constructive management because that
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be constructive just because
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
all set okay any more
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
questions comments okay
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
um I was about to say the clerk will
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
call the role but we don't have a motion
 
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
yet we don't have a
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
motion um so U representative uh Ames

motion representative spillsbury very
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you for taking it on in my
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
absence um I think what
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
we detected that the Senate bill sent to
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
us had an important purpose but didn't
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
go far enough and we've now elaborated
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
on it and clarified it and I think this
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
is just a dramatic step forward I think
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
when you reflect back on what the
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
current law says without this bill as
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
amended we cannot let it stay it it
 
00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839 align:start position:0%
places too grave a risk in the wrong
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
place so I urge otpa thank you any
 
00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.230 align:start position:0%
