00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
okay folks two minute warning two
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
right folks it is 1000 hours here in
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
state federal veterans uh as is our
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
custom we will start with a pledge of
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
allegiance and I'm going to look at
 
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bennett perhaps and ask
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
might I pled to the flag of the United
 
00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
States of America and to the Republic
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
for which it stands one nation God
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay at this time I'm going to hand my
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
gavl to our vice chair representative
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
Rollins because I am the prime sponsor
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
of this uh HCR
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
hcr1 house concurrent resolution 10
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
calling for the repeal of the Jones act
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
so uh represent Rollins uh good luck
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative MAF
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you Mr Vice chair okay uh
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to repre some arguments put
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
forth several years ago by Brian Riley
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
of the KO inst KO Institute uh on the
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
Jones act and you should have a handout
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's going around also from the KO
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
Institute on this measure
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
so the Jones Act is shorthand for the
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant Marine Act of
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
1920 and it provides a lesson in my view
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
on how economic
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
controls can backfire so the Jones Act
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
is described by the US Department of
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security as a protectionist
 
00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
policy intended to protect and develop
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
the American Merchant Marine and US ship
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
building protectionist elements of the
 
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
Jones Act of 1920 include requirements
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
that ships transporting goods within the
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
United States must be us crude us owned
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
and US
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
built so these Provisions many of us
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
feel today over a century later are not
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
only unnecessary but
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so Jones act Defenders
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
and supporters um allege or claim that
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
requiring the use of us Crews for
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
domestic waterborne shipping protects
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
Americans against foreign terrorists and
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
spies freely traversing say the
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
Mississippi River disguised as ship
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
operators uh some of us feel that's
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
largely a scare tactic so with or
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
without the Jones act it's still illegal
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
for someone to work in the United States
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
without a permanent resident card
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
supposedly a work permit or an
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
employment related
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
visa and this is true whether they
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
transporting merchandise between us
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
ports or employed in any other job the
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
Jones act's requirements that ships
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
transporting goods between domestic
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
ports must be us owned deprives the

open to foreign investment account for 7

million plus us jobs as other analysts
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
have pointed out removing ownership
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
limits would provide more opportunities
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
for Americans involved in domestic

00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee on foreign investment in the
 
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
United States it's called the
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
cfius to to mitigate National Security
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
concerns or risks and also it's been
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
argued that modern ownership
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
Arrangements render the Jones act
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
ownership requirement
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
Obsolete and maybe the most criticized
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
element of the Jones act has been its
 
00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
ban on the use of foreign built ships
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
for domestic shipping this is a unique
 
00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:45.879 align:start position:0%
regulatory barrier no other similar
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
restrictions apply to domestic
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
transportation of merchandise by air
 
00:34:51.879 --> 00:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
transportation of merchandise by air
rail

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
rail
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
truck as a result Americans pay infl
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
inflated prices for
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
ships according to a 2017 Congressional
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
research service report Coastal siiz
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
container ships built in the US cost six
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
to eight times more than comparable
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
foreign built
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
ships so the argument made by proponents
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
of maintaining the Jones Act is simple
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
the US needs a strong ship building
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
industry in the way to realize this goal
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
is by freeing it of the obligation to
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
compete with foreign ship
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
Builders but high tech tariffs don't
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily make Industries stronger
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
they actually can make them
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
weaker by reducing competition the Jones
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
act reduces the incentive for the US
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
ship Builders to innovate it's a problem
 
00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.550 align:start position:0%
ship Builders to innovate it's a problem
with

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
protectionism for take foreign car
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
competition I I drive a Nissan
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
Versa uh foreign car competition has
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
prompted American car manufacturers to
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
improve that people could buy Toyota
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
Toyotas instead of Fords makes Ford a
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
better company I remember in the 70s
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
Chrysler and American automobiles were
 
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
not very good buying large and they've
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
gotten much better why did they get
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
better because people started buying
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
Japanese cars so the American car
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturers improved their
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
product so according to the US Maritime
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
Administration the US non-defense Oceano
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
vessel Fleet declined from 193 ships in
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
2000 to
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
96 in October of 2018 it's probably less
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
now and our na we don't build ships like
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
we used to not even close our Navy and
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
again this is state federal veterans
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
committee our Navy is down to around 280
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
ships give or take China by comparison
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
has around 500 ships so our great
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
decline in domestic ship building
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
creates National Security issues as well
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
as economic
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
issues so some of the strongest
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation manufacturing Industries
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the US operate in a low tariff
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
environment us production of aircraft
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
railroad Rolling Stock automobiles as I
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
said uh heavyduty trucks has been
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
increasing even though the government
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
does not force Americans to use us built
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
Planes Trains or automobiles when
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
transporting cargo as it does with ships
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
moreover the effective tariff rate for
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
imported recreational boats you know if
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
you have a if I spend time at wiip
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
places packed with recreational
 
00:37:40.109 --> 00:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
boats so
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
the effective rate for these imported
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
recreational boats is just 1% but 95% of
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
the recreational boats sold domestically
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
are made in the USA without this this
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
protection so clearly American
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturer don't need High tariffs to
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
be successful they just need good
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
products in fact this their success is
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
contingent upon low trade barriers that
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
Foster Innovation and competition
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
quality products here's a specific
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
example of how the Jones act hurts
 
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
America uh a Washington State fishing
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
company uh it's called fisherman
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
Fisher's finest uh they commissioned a
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
new ship from Dakota Creek Industries
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
however because 7% 7 % of the ship's
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
steel was from Holland the ship was not
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to fish in US Coastal Waters so
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
here's an American built vessel and
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
because 7% of its its uh steel was from
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
another country it couldn't fish in US
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
Coastal Waters so George Will some of
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
you have heard of George will I'm a fan
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
of fiz I'll admit it so he wrote quote
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
fomenting spurious National Security
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
anxieties is the first Refuge of rent
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
seeking Scoundrels who tired up
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
protectionism as patriotism when they
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
inv vagle government into lining their
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
pockets with their fellow citizens money
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
unquote from George Will so trade
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
barriers undermine US security by
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
weakening the economy and creating
 
00:39:19.109 --> 00:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
conflict with our allies here in New
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
England we need fuel oil natural gas
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's been a cold winter uh as you may
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
have noticed uh pipelines are great but
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
they largely tapped out and regulations
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
make it hard to build new ones and we'd
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
love to have a pipeline come through New
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
York but politicians in New York won't
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
let it happen so we depend on fuel
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming here via
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
ship recent wall Wall Street Journal
 
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
article stated that the Jones act
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
limitations add costs that encourage
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
fuel to be exported overseas City
 
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
group's Global head of commodity
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
research told the paper the Gulf Coast
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
is not selling diesel to Philadelphia or
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
New York they sell it to places like
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
Holland so you got fuel Laden ships from
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
America that to satisfy the Jones act
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
they they have to bring fuel here not
 
00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
from the Gulf but from the from Holland
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
via the gulf it's uh absurd in my view
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's costly it's bad economics so again
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is over 100 years old
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
and instead of receiving unending
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
protection from International
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
competition ship Builders should operate
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the same low tff policy under which
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers as I said of trucks
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
automobiles planes and other Industries
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
are thriving so the Jones act should not
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
be allowed to inflict another 100 Years
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
or or 10 years or even even one year
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
this is a resolution that will be read
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
and heard if it moves forward and I hope
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
hope that when it does get this does get
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
to Executive
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
session uh this afternoon uh you'll
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
support this resolution that shines a
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
light on a serious situation while
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
encouraging Washington to take long
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
overdue action thank you Mr Vice chair
 
00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to try to try to answer any
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any are there any
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'll start at the table and
 
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.190 align:start position:0%
questions I'll start at the table and
come

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
around uh I just have a question why do
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
you think it hasn't has it been
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
addressed before and just not approved
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
or why do you think it hasn't been
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
addressed thank thank you for your
 
00:41:34.109 --> 00:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
question representative Bennett uh it
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
has been addressed before I read uh
 
00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
George Will's uh quote uh we addressed
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
it last term in this committee actually
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it came out of this
 
00:41:45.309 --> 00:41:45.319 align:start position:0%
committee 1010 and it was table in the
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
floor so we tried to uh address it in
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
this very committee uh so we're trying
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
again and I I I think because it affects
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire especially it's good to
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
have this this discussion in the winter
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
time as I said because it's so cold and
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
and uh without pipelines and because we
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
depend on shipping to bring fuel here uh
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
it it matters to New Hampshire but yes
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's come up before and
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh not just here but uh all over the
 
00:42:15.359 --> 00:42:18.630 align:start position:0%
uh not just here but uh all over the
country

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually further questions thank
 
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
you I know last time when we discussed
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
this there was a big um issue in regards
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
to the jobs that this would cost at the
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
Port um I don't have the exact figure on
 
00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
Me on the number of jobs but there was
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
definitely a large amount of jobs that
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
this would affect thank you repres Cy
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
yes that came up last time around and
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
there's we get different numbers and
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
different perspectives on jobs in New
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if the Jones act uh were
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
repealed would that affect any or many
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
jobs so uh obviously
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
those of us who support the bill don't
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
think that that the any jobs lost if
 
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
there are any jobs lost would be
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
significant but that that's from a
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
resolution question thank you Mr Vice
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
chair so many Americans U may have
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
concerns with foreign ships conducting
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
cabotage in America's Coastal Waters and
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
inland waterways if the Jones Act is
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
fully repealed um with global turmoil
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
with major waterborne Commerce country
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
countries such as Russia and China do
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
you think it's prudent to completely
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
repeal the Jones act or do you think it
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
may be a better option to reform parts
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
of it thank you for the question
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative plant that that's a good
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
question I touched on that a little bit
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh crew ships and the
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
security concerns and I I did try to
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
address that earlier uh to your point if
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
Congress which we hope does take this up
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily need to throw out
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
the whole uh repeal whole measure uh I
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
think you make a very interesting point
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
I think they could uh reform it was that
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
the term you used uh so that they have
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
the option of completely repealing it or
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
they could uh reform it to your point to
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
address in some fashion the consc the
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
security concerns if they're if they
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
consider those to be that real or viable
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's a good point they
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to repeal it they
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
could reform it if if they take it up in
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
questions representative ly thank you um
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess along those same lines
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
because that was actually the same
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
question I was going to ask uh is there
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
would you consider as a prime sponsor
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
amending the language to instead of say
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
repeal say amend and
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
address thank you for that uh as a prime
 
00:44:58.549 --> 00:44:58.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor I certainly would be open to
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
discussing changing that language from
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
repeal to reform that's something I
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
think to Representatives representative
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
plants Point uh may not be unreasonable
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh so yes it's something that we could
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
at further
 
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bela thank you
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for presenting
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
this bill I have a brief two-part
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
question if it would be allowed but
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
first is given the um definition change
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
for clean energy that passed through
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
this House of Representatives
 
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday um would
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
this if it goes through and if Congress
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
acts and if they make the necessary
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
changes or repeal to the Jones act would
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
this not dramatically stand to increase
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
the availability of clean energy in New
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for that first part
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
of your question the uh debate we had
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the house floor had to do a
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
lot with nuclear and and windmills and
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
whether they would be classified as as
 
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.829 align:start position:0%
whether they would be classified as as
clean

00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
clean
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
energy if we're talking natural gas that
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
seen that seem to be uh known to be a
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
cleaner not necessarily it's a fossil
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
fuel but it's cleaner than than coal or
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
or oil so yes I I agree I think that if
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
this moved forward and we could get
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
natural gas from the Gulf uh then that
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
would be uh a step in the right
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
direction for clean oil as you may know
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
the the bow power plant still uh
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
recently if not still has a coal
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
capability if we really need it so yes
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it could contribute to
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
clean energy in New
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow up thank you and so the
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
second part of that would be given
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
the rather significant changes to the
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
energy environment that are currently
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
occurring in federal policy that New
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
England broadly has really put a lot of
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
its eggs in the offshore wind
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
basket uh uh which may now be cut off
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
effectively given some of the executive
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
orders that come down isn't it really
 
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to increase our access to
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
these energy sources to secure our grids
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
and home heating for winter yes I think
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's a measure this resolution and if we
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
can get the Jones act repealed or
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
modified uh to to your earlier point to
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
our earlier Point uh that would be
 
00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
better for clean cleaner energy again in
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
terms of natural gas offshore wind I
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
know is in the news and uh it's
 
00:47:48.549 --> 00:47:48.559 align:start position:0%
interesting how offshore wind is is
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
being tied into the Jones act but I
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
think your point about clean energy and
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
especially if if offshore wind does not
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
move forward the way it was projected to
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
then we will need to look at
 
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and and I think repealing
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
the Jones act would help us to get the
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
natural gas alternative that we I think
 
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.549 align:start position:0%
natural gas alternative that we I think
we

00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
need further
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%

00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
um thank you m chair for taking my
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
question so were you the prime sponsor
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the same bill last term in the last
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
term thank you represent budha talki yes
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
I was I was the Prime sponsor last time
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
around follow
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
up would you sh lights
 
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:37.030 align:start position:0%
up would you sh lights
on

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
why the reasonings of opponents of this
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill last ter what what was the major
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
reasoning they give against or put forth
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
against this bill last time sure you've
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
heard one of them uh from the uh ranking
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
member there were concerns about
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
possible job losses and for the rest of
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
your question I know there are several
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
pink slips from some folks who do have
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
some uh knowledge and I think they could
 
00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:03.799 align:start position:0%
articulate the the problems with the
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
Jones act much better than me as the
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor so if you'll if you can
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
wait a bit I'm sure you'll have some
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
folks that'll make the the alternative
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
case much better than I
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
could further
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative lloy thank you
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:25.799 align:start position:0%
um the I guess my one of my other
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with this was would be in
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
regards to the US steel industry and
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
needing to use us steel Investments um
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
for this have we heard from any um any
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
Steel Workers unions or anything like
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
that thank for the question you seem to
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
recall a year ago or last term there was
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
someone from uh gilmington who
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
represented that segment of the labor
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
industry and they expressed concerns
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
that if we could have some amount of
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
foreign Steel in our ship building that
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
that could impact um
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
labor my thought after hearing that last
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
year was it it didn't seem to me to be a
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
a significant concern but that was just
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
opinion representative
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
Bennett thank you for taking my question
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering we're thinking about
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
jobs might be lost but would jobs be
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
gained in some ways because thank you
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
for that question I that's an excellent
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
question uh Bath Iron Works is a ship
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
builder in Maine and they build ships
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
and they we don't build as I touched on
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
earlier we don't build nearly as many
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
ships as we used to and with as the
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
point that I tried to make earlier and
 
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I think that we
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
think that removing some of the
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
protectionism would stimulate ship
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
building in America which we really
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
really need both uh mil naval military
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and also commercial so I think
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
that's a great point and I believe that
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
that if we get away from the Jones act
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
that it would be good for employment
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for coming to
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
our committee
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
happy to be here I I a couple of times
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
Ed the term artificially inflated
 
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
shipping is not a nice way of saying
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
coercion sure thank you for the for the
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
question and comment uh coercion I think
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
is is not a inaccurate term tariffs are
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
in the news a lot I know and so it's
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
interesting we're talking about tariffs
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
here and the whole tariff issue there's
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
many pieces to it generally
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know I am with the free trade out
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
free trade folks there are times where
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
tariffs uh are justifiable uh I I think
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
I I hate to contradict uh uh some folks
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
in DC I think short-term tariffs
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes have their place and there
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
there are reasons for them but
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
generally they raise prices they hurt uh
 
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
domestic jobs uh as I've already talked
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
about so uh yeah the
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
you could deem some of this coercive uh
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
but almost any legislative act could be
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
seen as is prompting some response or or
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
some activity that some would deem
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
coercive that coercive is kind of a
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
strong word um gentle prodding is a way
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to term
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
it I'll take a couple more question
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
question is there any fear that uh
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
repealing the Jones act would fully
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
decimate the US ship building industry
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
in that regard and make us more reliant
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
on uh foreign countries um like China
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
for instance you know we're using
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
Chinese ships to move Goods around the
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
US from coast to coast what if all of a
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
sudden one day uh the Chinese Communist
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
Party decided we're not we're not going
 
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
to allow you to use our ships anymore
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
then what do we do sure I touched thank
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question I touched on that
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
earlier and the the notion that
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
repealing the Jones act would uh hurt
 
00:53:30.359 --> 00:53:31.230 align:start position:0%
repealing the Jones act would uh hurt
our

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
domestic shipping
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
capabilities as I said earlier I think
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's the opposite I think that repealing
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
the Jones act would be better for ship
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
building and for American Commerce and I
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
cited the examples of planes and trains
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
and and Automobiles which are not
 
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
protected The Way domestic ship building
 
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
is and and they're thriving with
 
00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
competition so that would be my response
 
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh to that concern I I think that it
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
would repealing Jones act would would be
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
security any further
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative MAF excellent job thank
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire I represent the
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom and I've been very happy
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor this bill um the basic
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
issue here
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
is the Jones Act is is about um the
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
concept of free markets versus
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
protectionism and the Jones Act is
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
probably the best or one of the best
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
examples that we have that protectionism
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't work it was passed 105 years ago
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
at the time the US ship building
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
industry was the premier in the world
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
right and and the protectionism Pro of
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
provided by the Jones act caused that
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
industry to lack competition so that
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
we've gotten to the point where these
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
these uh large commercial ships simply
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
aren't built in the US anymore right
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not competitive they're
 
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
they you know the the industry has
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
dwindled to the point that that you
 
00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:35.319 align:start position:0%
simply can't get um liquid natural gas
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
type of ships a lot of container ships
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
and so on without the kind of um
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
expensive cost that that the prime
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor just mentioned so then the
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
question is if it's so bad why do we
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
still have it right why do we have it
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
105 years later right and the problem is
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
a political one this is one of those
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
examples of concentrated benefits and
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
diverse costs right so so the people
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
that Ben there are obviously some people
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
who benefit right there the people who
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
have the protected industry get some
 
00:56:15.029 --> 00:56:15.039 align:start position:0%
benefit from it they don't have to
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
compete it's easier for them Etc but and
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
so they know who they are and they can
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
go to and Lobby and and push to keep
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
their benefits but the the everybody who
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
pays higher shipping costs right the the
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
cost of your uh whatever that that gets
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
shipped to the United States or get
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
shipped from one part of the United
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
States to another is a little bit more
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
expensive but that's diverse right
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's you know pennies here and
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
pennies there so they don't know to go
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
and and um advocate for their position
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
because and it's not worth it to them to
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
advocate for their position and that's
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
why things like this um
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
continue I um sent you a few
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
examples uh I I sent you an email today
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
which which has plenty of uh articles
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
and and so on um about the situation
 
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'll give you um three specific examples
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
um just to kind of illustrate the
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
problems um the uh Puerto
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
Rico um need needs energy right they get
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
they use liquid natural gas for energy
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
and they currently are receiving it from
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
Chile right so it has to be shipped over
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
5,000 nautical miles through the Panama
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
Canal when right you know right in the
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
United States we have Pennsylvania has
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
plenty of natural gas plenty of shipping
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
we ship liquid natural gas to Europe and
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
other places and it's you know 1,500
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
miles away no Panama Canal much much
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
cheaper the problem is there doesn't
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
exist um us-made liquid natural gas
 
00:58:10.829 --> 00:58:10.839 align:start position:0%
ships so anytime you ship it it has to
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
be shipped one end of the of the of the
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
transaction has to be a foreign country
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
right because in that case the Jones act
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply and you can use the ships
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
that exists right so so Puerto Rico pays
 
00:58:28.029 --> 00:58:28.039 align:start position:0%
an exorbitant amount for their energy
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
simply because of the Jones act um and
 
00:58:36.029 --> 00:58:36.039 align:start position:0%
next next one is um I handed out today
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
um this letter from the New England
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
Governors uh it a couple of years ago
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
with the price of um natural gas was
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
getting high we had a tough winter and
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
so on so all six governors of New
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
England wrote um wrote a
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
um a letter to secretary granholm asking
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
for her to suspend the Jones act so that
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
New England could get shipments of
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
natural gas from Pennsylvania and the
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
Gulf Coast right directly from the
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
United States the U like I said the
 
00:59:15.029 --> 00:59:15.039 align:start position:0%
United States is an exporter and so
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
because there are no such ships when we
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
get liquid natural gas for winter it has
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
to come from Europe right so it's it's
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
just expensive and unnecessary and so on
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
I mean we ship to Europe and Europe
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
ships to us I mean it doesn't make any
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
sense and um so that s so so all of the
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
New England Governors not just
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
Republicans not just Democrats but
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
everybody um sent a letter and please
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
get you know let us be out of the Jones
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
act at least I mean they ask for
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
temporary but you know the the the
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
problem is is ongoing okay um and then
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about about cruises so
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
Carol and I like to take cruises um and
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
we tend to go maybe once a year once
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
every other year or something like that
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
and if you've ever taken a cruise you
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
will notice that it has to it always
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
goes to a foreign country right so I
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
took a cruise um a year ago year and a
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
half ago that went down the east coast
 
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
of the United States so it stopped in
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
New York City it's stopped in norfol it
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
stopped in Charleston and so on but
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
guess what what one day we went to
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
Canada right why did we do that it's
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
because of the Jones act it's because
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
all of these cruise ships have crew and
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
um uh and they're built mostly in
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
Germany and some other places but
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
they're not built in the United States
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
because of this
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
protectionism and uh and their crew is
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
often many foreign uh people and
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
so and so they have to you know the
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
Jones act causes this sort of natural
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
situation where you can't simply send a
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
cruise to those places and come back to
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
Boston it has to go to Canada um anyways
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer questions oh
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
maybe before I wanted to an to address
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
um a couple of U representative plants
 
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:18.839 align:start position:0%
question he talked about military so
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
another example of the problems of the
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
Jones one of the um when the Jones Act
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
was passed one of the one of the um
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
arguments put forward for it was that it
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
would help us build up a a a commercial
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
set of ships that in time of War would
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
be available for use by the military
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
right but the problem is because it's
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
gone the other way right comp because of
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
no competition the number of ships have
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
built in the US have declined um so for
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
example when we went to the war in Iraq
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
right the US government the the Army had
 
01:02:04.589 --> 01:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
to ship all kinds of tanks and other
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
equipment to Iraq so they had 500 ships
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
uh moving equipment to Iraq to fight
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
that war well only two of them if if I
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
remember right the only two of them were
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
Jones act chips right Jones act
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
compliance chips so the idea that
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
somehow it helps
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
our our security or our military or what
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
ever it it's the other way around
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
because we are not competitive we don't
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
have us sources of those ships right so
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
so all that shipping to move the
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
military to to uh to Iraq took place on
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
non Jones act ships right so so if we
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
get competition and it will help our
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
industry build up think of the
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
industries we have that are Premier in
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
the world right
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
um uh computer
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
software uh film
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
making um uh uh Financial sort of
 
01:03:08.789 --> 01:03:08.799 align:start position:0%
Industries um a lot of those are things
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
that have light or or no regulation
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
especially regulation of this sort right
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
um the the chairman
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned um Railroad and and airplanes
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
and so on so all these things where we
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
compete are places where we don't have
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
have things like the Jones act right we
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
have open
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
competition and even as he mentioned um
 
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
pleasure boats right there's not a Jones
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
act there plenty of pleasure boats are
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
built in the US RVs all this kind of
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
thing right so um so it hurts us
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
militarily and other ways not helps us
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
and now I'm happy to answer
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
representative cber yeah thanks um
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um so in
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
in the very beginning of um your
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
testimony you spec you said well you
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
didn't specify but when you referred to
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
they as being the protected interests or
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
something in regards to this um can you
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
specify a little bit more on who is they
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much so the way I
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
understand the Jones act in the ship
 
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.269 align:start position:0%
understand the Jones act in the ship
building

01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
arena is that um in order
 
01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
for a ship to move to move goods from a
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
Us Port directly to to another Us Port
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
it has to be
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
constructed in the United States right
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
so there are a handful of companies that
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
build ships in the United States for
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
this Market but as your chairman said
 
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
they cost many times more than similar
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
ships container ships and other ships
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
built elsewhere well there are a there
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
are a handful of companies that build
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
such ships it turns out most of them if
 
01:05:09.069 --> 01:05:09.079 align:start position:0%
if not all are actually foreign
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
owned the work you know the the
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
shipyards and the building and so on is
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
in the US but they're owned by you know
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
Swedish they're part of other foreign
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
owners right so so those are the kind of
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
people that because they build those
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
special those ships that meet the the
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
Jones act they have an incentive to keep
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
it follow upk you so just to follow up
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
on that so I mean we can go on about how
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
they're foreign owned that wouldn't be
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
the first like I guess industry in the
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
US that would be have a similar
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
structure to that I mean technically it
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
isn't a monopoly let's say um I guess I
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to maybe stress or or ask
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
ask you like are we sure that are there
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
any definitive numbers that the our
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
amount of sh ship building would go up
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
and that there actually is a direct
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
interest in doing so if we were to do
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
this yes thank you for the question yeah
 
01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not saying there's anything
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
wrong with foreign ownership in
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
particular it's just that it doesn't
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
meet the the stated reasons when the Act
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
was passed right it's sort of the
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
opposite has has become happened in over
 
01:06:30.269 --> 01:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
the ensuing Century but
 
01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:31.910 align:start position:0%
the ensuing Century but
um

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
so the answer is it's it's not something
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to change overnight right
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
so so building up a large
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
industry is going to take time and and
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of catchup involved
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
right because you're starting from a
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
from a low point and and moving forward
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
so if you're asking me you know is the
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
number of sh I think the number of ships
 
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
built in the US of these types will go
 
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
up over time but I can't tell you you
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
know next year there'll be 10 and the
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
following year it'll be 20 and then you
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
know the year after that's that's
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
unknowable further questions
 
01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.829 align:start position:0%
unknowable further questions
representative

01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
for being here sir
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
um the uh six Governors they had asked
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
suspension would would that be a better
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
word to use instead of repeal because
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
that that means it doesn't go away
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
permanently it get it gives you time to
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
give it a trial instead of just uh and
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
do some feasibility studies instead of
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
just pushing it away yes thank you for
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
the question so I think the um the
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
reason the governor's letter is written
 
01:07:50.549 --> 01:07:50.559 align:start position:0%
that way is because it's not they didn't
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
write it to Congress they wrote it to
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
the executive branch and the executive
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
branch does have the authority to repeal
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
right this is a resolution going to
 
01:08:03.029 --> 01:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
Congress who could repeal it right so so
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's a different sort of a different
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
situation I personally don't think I
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
mean certainly a suspension is better
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
than nothing right but but I don't think
 
01:08:13.559 --> 01:08:15.309 align:start position:0%
than nothing right but but I don't think
it's

01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
um I really don't think there's much
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
question about the harms of of the Jones
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
act in
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.749 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
buak so you know I have this Johns act
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
in front of me you know I like the goals
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh you know the acts goals includes
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
bolstering you know economic and
 
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.829 align:start position:0%
bolstering you know economic and
Military

01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
Military
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency ensuring uh the US has
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
its own Merchant Marine to avoid
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
dependence on other nations uh its key
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
Provisions are shipping between us ports
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
requires cargo to be transported on us
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
built us owned and US flagged ships
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
vessels with us
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
Crews you here to testify against these
 
01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
goals and how is this aligned with the
 
01:09:10.839 --> 01:09:11.789 align:start position:0%
goals and how is this aligned with the
current

01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
Administration I mean
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
president yes thank you for the question
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
no I wouldn't say I'm necessarily
 
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
against the goals the the problem here
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
is you can put in the front of any piece
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
of legislation what your goals are but
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
the question is does the method of the
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the legislation end up Meeting those
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
goals and I would argue in this case it
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
did not right so so we would like it
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be nice if there's a a robust US
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
ship building industry and if um us
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
seamen uh were employed in moving Goods
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
back and forth and things like that
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely but but the problem is the
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
method that that was you know that the
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
part the bill that the active part of
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
the bill didn't have that
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
result so and and I don't have any
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
special knowledge of you know what the
 
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
Trump Administration thinks about this
 
01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
particular issue so I I can't really
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
answer that part of the question CH
 
01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
follow follow up
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
um if it's
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
date thank you for the question so I
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
don't I have the free market I guess is
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
what I think so so um I think that that
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh light regulation is the way to go in
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
in competitive businesses all right and
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
I I think like the examples I cited the
 
01:10:54.669 --> 01:10:54.679 align:start position:0%
US can do very very well um in
 
01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
competition we have a lot of innovation
 
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
here um we have a lot of smart people um
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
but protectionism simply doesn't
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
work further
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
providing our military with needed
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
logistical support in peace and in war
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
simply put without the Jones act foreign
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
companies subject to control or
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
influence by Foreign governments would
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
be permitted to transport vital caros on
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
our domestic waterways making our supply
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
chain vulnerable to Serious disruptions
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
including by China repealing the Jones
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
act would not only damage all of these
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
American interests but would do so
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
without creating any significant
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
economic benefit for the people of New
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a December 2023 study
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
conducted by the National Bureau for
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
economic research founds found that the
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
Jones act adds approximately 3/10 of a
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
cent to each gallon of gasoline yet this
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
minor increase pales in comparison to
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of fuel which is
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
determined by global market factors
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
moreover the study assumes International
 
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
carriers would pass nominal savings on
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
to customers
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
but such savings are nearly always
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
pocketed by oil Traders hcr1 argues that
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
terminating the Jones act would decrease
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
fuel costs when in reality the cost of
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
shipping has virtually no impact on the
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
cost of fuel for
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
consumers fuel prices on the World
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
Market are determined by oil companies
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
and any transportation savings are
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
pocketed by energy traders meaning if
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is waved it is oil Traders
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
not consumers and not American Mariners
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
who will benefit to summarize this
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
resolution is simply out of step with
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
the common sense Homeland and economic
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
security policy that the Jones act
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
represents we urge the committee to vote
 
01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:08.830 align:start position:0%
represents we urge the committee to vote
against

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
hcr1 uh thank you for for your time and
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
and consideration and if I could just
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
add one more brief note to my remarks
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
here um I we've heard some discussion
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
about uh the Jones act preventing the
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
the innovation of the US flag Fleet and
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
I would like to um emphatically state
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
that that is not the case um that uh the
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
US uh as I as I noted the US Maritime
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
industry contributes billions of dollars
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
to the American economy and that
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
includes in in modernizing its its Fleet
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
um we we see we we've heard uh
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I believe it was
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned Puerto Rico I'll use that as
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
an example uh the very first ever LNG
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
powered containership is a Jon act
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
vessel meaning it was built in the
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
United States owned by a us Company
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
crewed by us Mariners uh we've had a
 
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
number of awo members so Tugboat and
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
Barge companies uh that have been making
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
investments into wind development so we
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
we proudly consider us Maritime to be a
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
very modern and
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
modernizing uh industry that is is is
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
doing what needs to be done to meet uh
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
the the very unique energy challenge es
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
facing the nation as we look to the
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
Future so appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
just add that thank you thank you for
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
your testimony any questions
 
01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:38.270 align:start position:0%
your testimony any questions
representative

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you mentioned New
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employees employed in the
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
maritime uh are they uh working on
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
oceangoing vessels or just Tugboat
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
operators barge operators there's there
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be there would be a mix and I
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't have the specific data
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
for each industry but a number of those
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh a number of New Hampshire residents
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
engaged in the maritime Industries would
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
be engaged working on International
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
vessels but also working uh for for
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
Tugboat and barges uh we have a member
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
company Moran Towing corporation that
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
has ship assist operations in Portsmith
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of uh that that would be
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
the sort of local job that awo
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
specifically represents follow up follow
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.470 align:start position:0%
up thank
you

01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
so you mention like like the Mississippi
 
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
River will say they do a lot of barge
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
traffic right how if repealing the Jones
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
act how would that affect Tugboat
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
operators moving barges along the
 
01:17:46.679 --> 01:17:47.950 align:start position:0%
operators moving barges along the
Mississippi

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
Mississippi
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
River well the the the Jones act applies
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
to to all us us cargo trans
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation so any any any company
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
that's engaged in transporting cargo
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
from one Us Port to another Us Port is a
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
jonak compliant vessel so whether
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether that is a a a a tugboat and
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
Barge unit transp transporting fuel from
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
say the gulf to uh to uh the midatlantic
 
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
to Philadelphia or whether that is uh
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether that's an A tobo and Barge
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
operation or moving cargo on the
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
Mississippi those are all Jones act
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
compliant vessels and that would would
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
be those would be trade opportunities
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
that would be open up to foreign markets
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
if the Jones act were to be repealed
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
plant thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
for my question thank you for your
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um would you agree that the
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
reason there is little to no liquid
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
propane ships that are Jones act
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
compliant is already due to the free
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
market and that the demand is high
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
enough domestically to entice US ship
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
Builders to innovate and produce more
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
Jones act compliant ships yeah thank you
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
for the question sir I I I definitely
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
would agree that Jones act operators are
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
beholden to some of the realities of the
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
market one of the challenges that we
 
01:19:13.229 --> 01:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
that that our member companies have seen
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
with regard to building up the U the US
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
Fleet for LNG for LPG for other fuels of
 
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
that nature is that there is not um
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
there's not the consist
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
y uh there for uh for companies to feel
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh completely confident making those
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
Investments and so I'll give an example
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
um in reference to uh the request by uh
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
New England Governors um for a uh I
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
believe it was a waiver of the Jones act
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
for LNG shipments um that's that that
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
speaks to I think a lot of the
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
challenges that that us operators are
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
facing when it comes to making making
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
some of these inations uh what what we
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
have found uh States will often do is
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
look to wave the wave the Jones act in
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
the event of of an emergency for a
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
one-time shipment of LNG whereas what
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
our members are looking for um is an
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um make significant
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
investments in the LG Market as an
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
example um with the benefit of of
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts Our member companies
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
want to serve New England's fuel needs
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
um for for the long term term for the
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
foreseeable future and when states are
 
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
simply requesting what are essentially
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
oneoff uh deliveries of LNG that makes
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
the market a little bit more difficult
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
for um you know for for uh for our
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
members to uh to engage in without that
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
long-term stability does that answer
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
your question sir thank you other
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
questions uh go to the corner
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Belta Manion yeah so my
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
question is kind of like a chicken and
 
01:21:02.669 --> 01:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
egg thing with that is like is the
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
demand itself for the the manufacturing
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
of LG freighter uh being affected by the
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
fact that they don't need to compete on
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
this stage because of the protectionism
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
that's already in place and we have to
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
import from overseas and it's not worth
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
the investment right now no I mean I
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
would say that if there was the
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
stability of of a longer term contract
 
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
um awo member compan companes the the US
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
flag Fleet would happily make make those
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
investments in in the LNG Market I think
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges that we have been
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
seeing is that there just is not that is
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
is not that stability and I would we've
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
been talking a little bit about offshore
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
wind a lot of the same challenges exist
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
exist there now they're just uh our our
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
members uh the the US Fleet is in is in
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
the the business of making these
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
long-term Investments and it helps to
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
that pres bodu Jackie excuse me um it's
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
not a question it's a request would you
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
be able to send us the report that you
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
cited uh from National Bureau of
 
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
something I would be happy to do do that
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
sir representative Lloyd thank you and
 
01:22:19.950 --> 01:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um in
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
your opinion um or your organization's
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
opinion are there part of the Jones act
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
which might be able or open to be
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
amended or should everything stay
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
exactly as is I would say from from our
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
point of view the the Jones Act is is is
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
working it's working for American
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
consumers it's working for American
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
Mariners um it has broad bipartisan
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
appeal um at at Federal at the federal
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
level at the state level um we we would
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
not we would oppose any effort to repeal
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of the Jones act and and as I as
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
I hoped to to try to emphasize in my
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
testimony here we we believe any a
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
repeal of any aspect of the Jones act
 
01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be would be bad for the United
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
States and would be bad for the the
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as well further
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
testimony very good job all right thank

it
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
morning the Jones act and cargo
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
preference laws work to ensure we have
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%

of 1920 it's 105 years old it's been in
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
place there's been amendments but it
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
stood uh in has bipartisan support and
 
01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.149 align:start position:0%
stood uh in has bipartisan support and
has

01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
historically uh we also heard about ship
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
building um in New England um it's my
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that Bath Iron Works which
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
was brought up earlier they specialize
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
in building warships they build
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
specialized uh Navy destroyers up in
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
bath up on the kbec river there are
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
multiple small uh shipyards that build
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
tugboats small cargo ships and fishing
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
boats uh specifically in Maine but in
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
New England and those are uh domestic
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
jobs with specialized domestic
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
Labor uh I also heard discussion earlier
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
about Cruise Lines uh this summer
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth enjoyed the opportunity to uh
 
01:29:29.229 --> 01:29:29.239 align:start position:0%
invite the cruise liner American Cruise
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
Lines which is a jonak compliant and
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
passenger vessel uh Services act
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
compliant uh Cruise Line means it's US
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
flag US own us crude and they were going
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
in and out of pment this
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
summer uh as far as military cargo uh
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
International military cargo does not
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to go on Jones at
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
compliant vessels but it's going to go
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
on vessels that are us owned uh us
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
flagged with us Crews that are moving
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that uh military material whether it's
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh food fuel ammunition um or what is
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
required by the Department of Defense to
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
be moved domestically and
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
internationally uh and uh recently as
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
we've just rolled into a new
 
01:30:19.390 --> 01:30:19.400 align:start position:0%
Administration the uh during his
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
confirmation hearing the department of
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh Transportation secretary Shan Duffy
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh shared his support for the Jones act
 
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
during his confirmation in the
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
Senate that is the end of my testimony
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I welcome any questions thank you
 
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
questions yeah thanks for taking my
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
question um I actually thought of this
 
01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
when you were mentioning Coast Guard um
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
how the Coast Guard you know whatever
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
they approve folks um under the Jones
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
act um for Mar for being Mariners um but
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
um we know that you know as much as we
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
try to stop it that also like drugs can
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
come in through obviously through the
 
01:31:11.229 --> 01:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
waterways is one major way um how how
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
would this affect that like um repealing
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
the Jones act could that affect that and
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
in what way are you aware of
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
possibly I'm not aware specifically of
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
of how
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh influx of uh drugs and illegal cargo
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
could uh be affected by the Jones act
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
however uh Jones act Mariners are going
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
to be US citizens they're going to uh go
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
through background checks in order to
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
obtain a credential and maintain a
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
credential so much much like you would
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
see a TSA agent at the airport and you
 
01:31:51.189 --> 01:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
know that they are um an employee of the
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
TSA and they've gone through whatever
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
background checks required to ensure the
 
01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
security at the airport uh A Jones act
 
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
us Merchant Mariner holding a US
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant Marine credential and a
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
transportation workers identification
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
credential has gone through a stringent
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
background check has been overseen by
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
the US government and uh the Coast Guard
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
as well to ensure that that person uh
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
has a clean and clear background so in
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
that way these Jon act Mariners ensure
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
that security because they are secure
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
Personnel operating these
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
questions pick
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
one thank you for taking my question um
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
you gave a lot of statistics about
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
people who work on the ships and all of
 
01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:44.310 align:start position:0%
people who work on the ships and all of
those

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
numbers so how are you seeing the Jones
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
act as I'm thinking you're thinking if
 
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
With the Jones Act is is
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
appealed um that these jobs how are you
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
seeing these jobs going away I'm seeing
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
it as they would maybe increase but how
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
are you seeing
 
01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
are you seeing
it

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.550 align:start position:0%
it
so

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
for those jobs the Jones act related
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
jobs are all US citizens that are
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
employed on these vessels and and uh
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
with these vessels so specifically for
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
someone like me that went to Maine
 
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
Maritime Academy and then uh took my US
 
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
Coast Guard administer Merchant Marine
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
officer exams if a shipping company was
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
not a Jones act vessel if it was a
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
foreign vessel then I might not be able
 
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
to be employed on that vessel um there's
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
International credentials there's other
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh countries that can employ Mariners
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
and so if that uh if a foreign uh
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
company uh could employ a foreign
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
Mariner over a US Mariner pay them less
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
not have to ensure um safety and uh and
 
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
um security like the US requires of
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
their Mariners than they might go ahead
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
and do that and so that would be a
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
direct loss of an American job uh
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
employment good employment for an
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
American family and a a local uh student
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
that might be coming out of a Maritime
 
01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:26.070 align:start position:0%
that might be coming out of a Maritime
Academy

01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
for being here sir thank you
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
um there's pros and cons to both of uh
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
repealing the Jones act
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
um obviously if it is repealed there's
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
going to be a hiccup in the water
 
01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.229 align:start position:0%
going to be a hiccup in the water
transportation

01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:34:47.239 --> 01:34:48.910 align:start position:0%
transportation
industry

01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
and T as we know in this world timing is
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
everything and with
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
things coming out of Washington right
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
now such as uh we don't know where
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
international trade is going on
 
01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
especially with tariffs and so on and uh
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
we want to become less dependency on
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
foreign oil is is the timing wrong right
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
now to
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
this in response to your question sir I
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
I believe the timing will always be
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
wrong to repeal the Jones act however
 
01:35:28.350 --> 01:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
ever uh one thing that I I've learned is
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
that the Jones act does bring stability
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
especially to uh States and um
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
protectorates of the United States that
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
rely on US flag vessels for instance
 
01:35:44.199 --> 01:35:46.790 align:start position:0%
rely on US flag vessels for instance
Hawaii

01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hawaii
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh food fuel uh that go to and from
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
Hawaii go on Jones act vessels if the
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
Jones Act were to be
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
repealed then Hawaii would have to rely
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
on foreign vessels to uh stop by and
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
bring them their food and some of their
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
fuel if a us if a foreign vessel did not
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to do that or wanted to charge an
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amount of money to ship to
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hawaii then the people of Hawaii would
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
be reliant on that service uh
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
additionally um we have United States
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
does have designated services that
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
service islands like hoi and so with
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
what you might call just in time
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
delivery you might be drinking one
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
gallon of milk and your next gallon of
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
not uh your next gallon of milk might be
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
on that cargo vessel and a uh
 
01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
refrigerated container on its way to
 
01:36:52.350 --> 01:36:52.360 align:start position:0%
Hawaii from the mainland so that your
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
next gallon of milk
 
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh is on its way if you didn't have that
 
01:37:00.030 --> 01:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
reliability then you don't know where
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
that next gallon of milk is coming from
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
just as an
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
example further
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative Lloyd thank you
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I'm
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
going to ask you the exact same question
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
I've been asking others um in your
 
01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
opinion um especially as someone who has
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
worked in the maritime community and
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
done as much as you have um
 
01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:26.679 align:start position:0%
are would there be any opening for
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
amending the Jones ACT versus repeal or
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
should it stand as is in your
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
opinion it has stood as is for 105 years
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
however um I think
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
if that it's a piece of legislation so
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's always open for Amendment if there
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
were amendments put forward that uh
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
would benefit uh the US people uh the US
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
Merchant Marine and ensure the stability
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
the security uh and the economic um
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
benefits then I
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
believe an amendment would be uh open
 
01:38:02.679 --> 01:38:04.149 align:start position:0%
believe an amendment would be uh open
and

01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'll take two more questions
 
01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:08.040 align:start position:0%

he could make out the b on the pink card
 
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:00.679 align:start position:0%

Andrew and I went to the same Academy so
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
I was trying to get a picture so I can
 
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
Association and I do apologize I had my
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
tie with me but I left it in the parking
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
lot and I walked here and I don't have
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
my Bean boots so I wasn't going back to
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
well uh good morning chairman members

I'm going to read my my statement and
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
then I look forward to some questions
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
because I have worked on every single
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
one of these issues that was brought up
 
01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
today and in a very uh very detailed way
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
and so I think I can help bring some
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
perspective to to this uh today I speak
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
in opposition of hcr1 calling for the
 
01:39:50.189 --> 01:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
repeal of the Jones act as a former New
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%

I worked aboard the iconic tugboats in
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Harbor as a three combat tour
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%

01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
Captain also as the former deputy
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
Maritime administrator appointed by
 
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.629 align:start position:0%
Maritime administrator appointed by
President

01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
President
 
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
Trump I hope my perspective adds and
 
01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:14.830 align:start position:0%
Trump I hope my perspective adds and
helps

01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
helps
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
you the Jones act has enjoyed bipartisan
 
01:40:20.350 --> 01:40:20.360 align:start position:0%
support in New Hampshire and in
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
Washington for many years as a former
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
Trump appointee I am especially pleased
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
that President Trump recently shared a
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
pro Jones act oped and his
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation secretary Shan
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
Duffy uh mentioned support for the Jones
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
act in his recent nominations
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
hearings this is all for good reason in
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
the face of the Chinese Communist
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
parties escalating Global Maritime
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
Ambitions and ship building dominance
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is our nation's last line
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
of defense it is critical to Growing our
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
Maritime sector more importantly it's
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
critical to maintaining our reserve of
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
us Mariners to support our deployed
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
forces who are defending our
 
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
nation securing our borders and
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
protecting us from undue dominance of
 
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:14.910 align:start position:0%
protecting us from undue dominance of
foreign

01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
governments though we have a short
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
Coastline here in New Hampshire it is
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
still a maritime State we experience 236
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
million in the maritime industry in the
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
state and and it affects hous homes
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
across the
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
state 1,200 Jobs and 73 million in
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
wages if the Jones act will repeal today
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
then New Hampshire would rely on Chinese
 
01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.830 align:start position:0%
then New Hampshire would rely on Chinese
shipping

01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
shipping
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and you better believe that
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
those profits would not be seen here by
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
our consumers they would go back to
 
01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.629 align:start position:0%
our consumers they would go back to
China

01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
China
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
there are challenges in the US Maritime
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
industry but we know what they are and
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
we know how to fix them it makes no
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
sense to concede this important Market
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
to any foreign government repealing the
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
Jones act would give many New Hampshire
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
and nation's Maritime Workforce a pink
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
slip making us even more vulnerable in
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
Wartime the repeal would off hundreds of
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
thousands of us jobs to foreign workers
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
shut down critical Maritime Academy
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
and devastate our commercial ship
 
01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:26.790 align:start position:0%
and devastate our commercial ship
building

01:42:26.790 --> 01:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
industry rather than request a repeal of
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
the Jones act New Hampshire legislators
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
should join the Congress and the Trump
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
Administration in supporting and
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
strengthening America's domestic ship
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
building and shipping Industries if we
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
want to compete with China we need to
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
secure our borders and we must keep the
 
01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:46.830 align:start position:0%
secure our borders and we must keep the
Jones

01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
Jones
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
act that's a very brief quick statement
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
but I am more than happy to talk about
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
all of these issues
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
especially two ship building and LNG and
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
energy to New England cuz I found myself
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
in the Oval Office being tasked
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
personally by the president to work on
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
those issues in the previous
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
administration chair thank you question
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you thank you Captain I was
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
in Need for signalman back in the day uh
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that uh the Jo Act is is
 
01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.310 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that uh the Jo Act is is
important

01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
um for us because uh it helps with our
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
security etc etc so if the Jones Act is
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
so important why are we not building
 
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
more ships so that more American crews
 
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
could man American Flag ships well sir
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's a good question um and that has
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
been a problem in the past as I
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we do have our problems
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
and in fact if you want to look up ships
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
for America Act which was just
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
introduced in the US Senate and the US
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
House of Representative it has
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support in both the Senate as
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's been supported as it's been
 
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
sponsored by uh Senator Kelly from
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
Arizona um I forget who the Republican
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
is and then the same on the house side
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
and that very piece of
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislation was also co-authored by the
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
now uh National Security adviser Waltz
 
01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
um to uh increase ship building in the
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
United States to increase the size of
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
our Merchant Marine and to counter the
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
Chinese threat I think what a lot of
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
folks maybe may not know in this room is
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the the Chinese are our major
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
adversary in this industry they are the
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
largest Builders of ships in the world
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
they are predatory in the way they do
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
their business and I'll give you a great
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
example without using uh the company's
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
name one of our us shipping companies
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
was involved in a little fender bender
 
01:44:53.070 --> 01:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
in a port and had to go to ship your
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
yard to get it repaired they went to
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
three different us shipyards to get uh
 
01:45:00.629 --> 01:45:00.639 align:start position:0%
quotes the quotes came back between
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
three and5 million to do the repair the
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
Chinese came to that company and offered
 
01:45:10.870 --> 01:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
for them to sell the ship to China have
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
the repairs done and then bring it back
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
to work in the United States which is
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
completely legal there's a a vat tax
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
that has to be paid do you know what the
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
$90,000 that's not real those are not
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
real numbers it's because it's so
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
heavily subsidized and government owned
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's impossible for Private Industry or
 
01:45:37.589 --> 01:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
capitalistic Society to compete against
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
that and so that's what we're up against
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's just one example of the types of
 
01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
things that that are being
 
01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
done follow up thank you so that was
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
the ships for America Act yes sir but
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
more follow up on that it was introduced
 
01:45:56.510 --> 01:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
in December
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh in your estimation with your
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge that you have what's going on
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
does this act have any legs is it it
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
does it's an enormous act it's a it's a
 
01:46:11.790 --> 01:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's a an attempt to fix uh Decades of
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
um neglect within our own Maritime
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
industry uh so it's it's taken a big
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
bite out of the Apple but I I think what
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
we'll see is portions of it will be
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
taken and put into to the next uh uh
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
National Defense authorization act
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
because itself as a piece of legislation
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
is so it's it's so encompassing that
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be difficult to push
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
through the Congress and the Senate uh
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
as a whole and that's just my personal
 
01:46:41.990 --> 01:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
opinion further
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions Madam clerk thank you and
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question same
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
exact question for you as I've asked
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
everybody else um in your opinion given
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
your history and and what you've worked
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
on um would would amending the Jones act
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
be a potential possibility instead of
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
repeal or would that should it stay as
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
is well uh it should stay as is but but
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
let me explain that what what what
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't been talked about here today is
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is not just this one
 
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
strict law that says you can't do this
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
and you can't do that there are multiple
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
paths to wave the Jones act for example
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
if a company comes into the United
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
States and wants to do heavy lift
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
operations in our offshore environment
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
and that that type of ship that can lift
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
those kinds of loads does not exist in
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
the US Fleet then they can quickly apply
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
for a us uh non-availability waver the
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
maritime Administration and the
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security issue
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
that and then they can go work and
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's a foreign vessel working in our
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
ports to the LG issue there are already
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
two waivers on the books for companies
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
to come in and take uh foreign ships to
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
take uh Fuel and bring it to New England
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
with one stipulation they have to ref
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
flag to the United States uh and the
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
reason that hasn't happened is because
 
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
there is no long-term Market I worked on
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
this very issue for a lot of months in
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
my first term in the Trump
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
Administration and the problem is Neo
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
has regulations that will not allow
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies to enter into more
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
than a six- week contract to provide
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
fuel to the region the pipelines are
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
tapped out as was mentioned the storage
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
capacity is tapped out I had companies
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
like shell accelerate energy all willing
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
to ref Flag ships to come in and service
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
this Market because the letter I think
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative Jones mentioned for
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
the six Governors that sent it to the
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
president that's why I got called in and
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
the president said find us a solution we
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
brought multiple solutions to the table
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
multiple companies to the table in the
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
end none of them could do it because of
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
the of the uh inability for the region
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
to enter into long-term contracts but I
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
do have some good news the first ref
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
flagged LG carrier has been purchased by
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
Crowley Maritime and is currently in the
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
shipyard right now being prepared to
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
enter US flag and will be able to to
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
service Puerto Rico will be able to
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
service New England if the need is come
 
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.070 align:start position:0%
service New England if the need is come
comes

01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
comes
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
up further
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you sir and with no
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%

head

01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.350 --> 01:51:28.360 align:start position:0%

will exact we plan to exact uh all these
 
01:51:36.510 --> 01:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
measures this afternoon that's the plan
 
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
that's the hope uh we'll see how things
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
go we have one more hearing this morning
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
on hr12 and we have one this afternoon

01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
hcr1 uh repres of Jones I hope you don't
 
01:51:51.069 --> 01:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
take the repeal of Jones act personally
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's just a coincidence that
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh that we have a Jones in our committee
 
01:51:57.930 --> 01:51:57.940 align:start position:0%
uh nothing personal of course
 
01:51:57.940 --> 01:52:00.830 align:start position:0%
uh nothing personal of course
[Laughter]

01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
so I also want to point out I it might
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
have been the deputy ranking member it
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
asked about changing the wording and we
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
we did put in a request to OS for a
 
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
slight wording change in response to
 
01:52:16.350 --> 01:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
your uh your input so that will be
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully forthcoming this afternoon if
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
if OS can can get to that FYI
 
01:52:24.069 --> 01:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
okay at this
 
01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
time uh we want to go to
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
hr12 which is urging Congress to amend
 
01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
the Smith month modernization Act of
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
2013 and the prime sponsor uh is from
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
this committee representative belshire
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
and I know there are perhaps hundreds of
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
people watching at home who want to know
 
01:52:51.229 --> 01:52:51.239 align:start position:0%
more about the Smith Mont modernization
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
Act of 2013 so welcome I'm sure that uh
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
you can uh inform on inform everyone on
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you chairman Moffett and
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you members for having me here to
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
introduce another bill the good news
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you is we're probably going to
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
get back on track TimeWise shortly they
 
01:53:12.669 --> 01:53:12.679 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take too long first of all
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
this bill resolution um was the result
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
of our work in the covid-19 efficacy
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
investigation committee
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
from last year this was one of the
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came forward from
 
01:53:27.679 --> 01:53:28.669 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came forward from
the

01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
committee so the Smith Mont act existed
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
for much of modern American history and
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
it contained in it a very important and
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
unique provision that prohibited the
 
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
federal government from propagandizing
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
the American
 
01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
people this was a Prohibition on using
 
01:53:53.310 --> 01:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
the sort of techniques of information
 
01:53:56.910 --> 01:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
Warfare and propaganda that we utilize
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the state department federally and in
 
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:00.189 align:start position:0%
in the state department federally and in
the

01:54:00.189 --> 01:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
military on other countries there was a
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on propagandizing American
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
citizens this law was amended by the
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
Smith month modernization Act of
 
01:54:18.109 --> 01:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
2013 and critically in that act the
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
prohibition on propagandizing the
 
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
American people was removed
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
the result has been quite
 
01:54:30.589 --> 01:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
dramatic we have seen through various
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
sources on both sides so this is really
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
not even a partisan thing we've seen on
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
both sides of the matter problems cut
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
Downstream from this we've learned from
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
the mainstream media in various articles
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
we've learned from the so-called Twitter
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
files even the work of the newly minted
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
Department of government off efficiency
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
at the federal level that's currently
 
01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
exposing a lot of interesting funding
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
that has happened under uh USA and and
 
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
some other
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
organizations what we are learning and
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
what we have found is that billions and
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars of federal tax money
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
expended through various media sources
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
and on various information Warfare
 
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
campaigns that have utilized even jok or
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
the joint um Special Operations Command
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
and their psychological warfare
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
divisions to affect Americans perception
 
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
of various things that have happened in
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
our country's recent history not not at
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
all limited to but including things that
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
occurred under the covid-19 pandemic
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
there were influence operations that
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
were undertaken under various names
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
utilizing things such as nudge Theory
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
and other items to change the way
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
Americans viewed and thought about items
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
including the source of
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 the safety and efficacy of
 
01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.430 align:start position:0%
covid-19 the safety and efficacy of
various

01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
various
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
treatments who or what uh people or
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
countries might be responsible for what
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
happened there were information Warfare
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
and propaganda campaigns undertaken with
 
01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
American Funds by the American
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
government against American
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
citizens and all of this is Downstream
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
from the Smith month modernization Act
 
01:56:31.639 --> 01:56:32.350 align:start position:0%
from the Smith month modernization Act
of

01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
legal so this is a fairly simple
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
resolution that asks Congress to re
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
amend this act to
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
reinsert that longstanding prohibition
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
on using taxpayer funds using the state
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
department using the military to
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
propagandize and conduct information
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
Warfare campaigns against the American
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
people on us soil it's not something
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
that should have ever been done it was
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
we really need to fix it thank you I'll
 
01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:12.109 align:start position:0%
we really need to fix it thank you I'll
take

01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
belshire you preempted a question that
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
came to my mind as I was reading the
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
resolution and listening to your
 
01:57:21.639 --> 01:57:22.709 align:start position:0%
resolution and listening to your
testimony

01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to us
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
Aid uh that's hugely in the news the
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
last couple days and it relates to do
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
and in that effort in DC currently and
 
01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
apparently us Aid has been uh directing
 
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
many millions of dollars to the likes of
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
political uh presumably to influence
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
press coverage so my first question is I
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
is with regard to when you submitted
 
01:57:54.189 --> 01:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
this because is very timely extremely
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
timely I think but this is not something
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
you just put in this week so for people
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
who don't understand the process for
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
putting in uh bills or resolutions or or
 
01:58:07.069 --> 01:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
HRS or
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
hcrs when did you submit this to to the
 
01:58:15.069 --> 01:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
uh OS process thank you and that's a
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
very good question um so you may or may
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
not be aware that in the last house term
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh our speaker uh created a new
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee to investigate the state's
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
response to covid-19 to figure out what
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
happened what was done good what might
 
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
have been done better and it was through
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
that investigation that I was a part of
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
and had the um the pleasure of being
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
able to author the report on mostly uh
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
we were able to
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
learn about the these sorts of things
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
other things as well but the sort of
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
information Warfare campaigns that took
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
place and I can say information Warfare
 
01:58:58.350 --> 01:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
and I can use that word accurately
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
because they actually used military
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
assets to conduct some of this
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
information uh Warfare on us
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
soil this came to the light of the
 
01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
committee we felt it was important to as
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
one of the multiple recommendations of
 
01:59:16.069 --> 01:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
the committee to move forward with some
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
kind of a call for Congress to fix this
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
issue so it stops
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it was a committee uh
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
effort and this was put in um without
 
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
the full knowledge of everything that
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
we've come to know in the recent times
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
but with enough knowledge of what had
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
happened and you brought up the issue of
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
the funding that has flowed to various
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
mainstream media Outlets even more
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps importantly than the funding is
 
01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
to recognize the Personnel that have uh
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
occupied role roles in some of these
 
01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
major mainstream media outlets in the
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
time since have come directly from prior
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
roles in the state department prior
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
roles in the CIA and prior roles in
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
Military Intelligence before coming to
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
occupy those roles in mainstream media
 
02:00:12.189 --> 02:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of connections there
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
again it's all Downstream from smithm
 
02:00:17.550 --> 02:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
and that's where we need to fix
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
this representative the committee you
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
sub you referred to that the speaker put
 
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
together that was presumably a
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee how how large was
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
the committee can describe the makeup a
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
little bit indeed it was I believe we
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
had a 10- member committee uh so it was
 
02:00:35.790 --> 02:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
broken down evenly uh partisan Le 5 and
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
five um we met a couple dozen times I
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
believe took um dozens upon dozens of
 
02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
hours of expert testimony on various
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
subjects uh and we put together a fairly
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report that was
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
published around November of last
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
year did you say you met a couple dozen
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
times did I hear that correctly I
 
02:01:01.069 --> 02:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
believe it was I believe it was at least
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
an excess of a dozen times maybe maybe
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
two dozen times we met quite a lot we
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
met basically every Friday for the
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
better part of a
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
year thank you other questions for the
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative Manion
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh uh you mentioned a lot
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
about the covid-19 but it's highly
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
likely would you uh agree that it's
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
highly likely that this could be used to
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
spark a you know propaganda war against
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
weapons of mass destruction for a
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
military invasion of some country under
 
02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.950 align:start position:0%
military invasion of some country under
false

02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
false
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
pretenses uh in indeed it could and as
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
part of our um our research as a
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
committee and as part of my personal
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
Research into the sorts of things that
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
have occurred we actually know that um
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
the state department and Military assets
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
have been utilized in public influence
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
information campaigns uh around more
 
02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
recent events such as the war in Ukraine
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
that has tragically perhaps resulted in
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
already other questions representative
 
02:02:07.069 --> 02:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you rep
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I need a
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
little point on line six here um you in
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
quotes nudge Theory could you explain
 
02:02:18.910 --> 02:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
what nudge theory is yes thank you so
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
nudge theory is a concept that comes out
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
of um Research into psychological
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
warfare and psychology generally that
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
suggests that people are manipulable in
 
02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.510 align:start position:0%
suggests that people are manipulable in
their

02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:02:35.950 --> 02:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
beliefs by undertaking small incremental
 
02:02:38.830 --> 02:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
steps of information change this is
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
something that we know was uh undertaken
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
specifically because of information that
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
came out of uh especially Britain under
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
their I believe it's MI6 Intelligence
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
Division they work Clos with uh some of
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
the founders and proponents of nudge
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
Theory and they were also involved with
 
02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
um along with our state department and
 
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
jck in conducting nudge Theory campaigns
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
using subtle information shifting um and
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
framing uh in media and um paid
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
information campaigns on the internet
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
things other questions representative
 
02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
things other questions representative
cyber

02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
cyber
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
so I have a question too because we're
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
talking also about corporate media here
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
and as we know there are a lot of well a
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
couple meain corporate media Outlets who
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
are um definitely a huge part of and
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
while practicing their Amendment rights
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
to you know free speech and all that
 
02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
though that are effectively doing what
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
this is you know aiming to stop and
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
quite honestly it doesn't stop them not
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
saying this this resolution is bad in
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
any way but should we not go further
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
into trying to stop them from doing the
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
exact same thing on behalf of the
 
02:04:05.069 --> 02:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
government but without the government's
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
approval thank you for the question and
 
02:04:09.069 --> 02:04:09.079 align:start position:0%
that's a very important distinction to
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
bring up and talk about
 
02:04:14.189 --> 02:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
because what we're talking about is in
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
the original Smith month act it was a
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on the state department and
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
Military from conducting propaganda
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
operations against Americans
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
and what is propaganda you can you can
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
reasonably Define propaganda as any
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
information effort taken to attempt to
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
change somebody's views about something
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
well every op-ed in history that's ever
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
been written is therefore reasonably
 
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
defined as propaganda and that's okay
 
02:04:41.229 --> 02:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
because individual citizens and
 
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
corporate entities that are not
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
government have rights to free speech
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association and these things
 
02:04:49.549 --> 02:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
they can even go so far as to say things
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
that aren't true and as long as they're
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
not violating laws against defamation or
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
the other very specific carve outs for
 
02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
free speech there's really not much we
 
02:05:02.189 --> 02:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
can do about that lawfully but it's a
 
02:05:04.589 --> 02:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
very different um issue entirely When
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
government gets involved because
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
government is by necessity a massive
 
02:05:12.189 --> 02:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
coercive apparatus it has a monopoly on
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
violence so when the government decides
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
that it has not just the Monopoly on
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
violence but also is the Arbiter of
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
Truth now you have the only entity with
 
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
the guns and the means and Taxation too
 
02:05:26.709 --> 02:05:26.719 align:start position:0%
by the way so they can forcibly take
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
money from people you have the only
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
entity with all of those things now
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
deciding what is true and false and
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
operating in the information space to
 
02:05:36.549 --> 02:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
try to make everyone else believe what
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
is true and false according to it so
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very different thing because
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
government simply put government doesn't
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
have free speech rights people have free
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
speech rights so we can't really go any
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
further with this than saying government
 
02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative the Smith month
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
modernization Act of 2013 obviously was
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
named after some Congress people do you
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
know who Smith and Mt were I must
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
confess that I I do maybe maybe I'm not
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the only one who doesn't remember who
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
they were do do you know thank you I
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
honestly I would have to do a search
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
because that's well before my time
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
because actually the smithm
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
modernization ACT amended the original
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
Smith Mont act which if I'm not mistaken
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
dates to sometime in the early uh 20th
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
century right thank you for that I was
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
wondering if if it was a bipartisan uh
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
combination I but that's something we
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
can find out just curious uh
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative cyber kind of have a
 
02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
followup to my other
 
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:42.030 align:start position:0%
followup to my other
question

02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that there is a
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
possible need
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
for propaganda on behalf of the Govern
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
government to be used if said lies um by
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
the people that the very second
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment laws
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
protect um that those lies can cause a
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
national security risk and therefore
 
02:07:12.109 --> 02:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
based on a lie would there would need to
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
be propaganda come behind
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
that thank you and and that's a good
 
02:07:18.189 --> 02:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
question and that's some of the line of
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
argumentation that was um relev in the
 
02:07:26.030 --> 02:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
initial taking away of that prohibition
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
toward government propaganda what I what
 
02:07:31.069 --> 02:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
I would say is there is unfortunately no
 
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
perfect solution to false speech the
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
only uh the best solution is to have a
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
an Open Marketplace of ideas where
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
people are free to say things that are
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
both true and false and hopefully the
 
02:07:48.390 --> 02:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
truth will rise to the top as people can
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
demonstrate things to be false because
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
things that are false can often be
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to be false the problem is
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
when government gets involved in that
 
02:08:00.549 --> 02:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
effort explicitly to try to demonstrate
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
something is what is true the government
 
02:08:05.870 --> 02:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
is necessarily taking a side in
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
something and sometimes it would be a
 
02:08:10.109 --> 02:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
side I like sometimes it' be a side I
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't like but in any case because it
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
has exclusive power to violence
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
exclusive power to taxation it can then
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
take that mandate for deciding what is
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
true and what is not and take tax money
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
as we have now seen to begin to assert
 
02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:32.559 align:start position:0%
information uh environment control by
 
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
placing persons various places in
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
mainstream media in New Media and
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
running these operations that really
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
have the ultimate effect of muddying the
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
waters so much that one of the
 
02:08:46.430 --> 02:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate things we are seeing I think
 
02:08:47.709 --> 02:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of people simply don't
 
02:08:52.030 --> 02:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
know what is true and false anymore
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
repr if I could follow up on
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
representative cyber's
 
02:08:58.510 --> 02:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
point I I'll point out that during World
 
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
War II the government funded a Why We
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
Fight uh series of films and news reals
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
that had received widespread
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
dissemination uh all over the country
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
and beyond our borders uh Ronald Reagan
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
was an actor who was part of that effort
 
02:09:18.599 --> 02:09:19.229 align:start position:0%
was an actor who was part of that effort
I

02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
believe so would
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
you would you think or do you believe
 
02:09:33.149 --> 02:09:33.159 align:start position:0%
that the use of government funds to
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
support I guess you could call it
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
propaganda uh somewh I suppose the the
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
Why We Fight series that made the case
 
02:09:43.149 --> 02:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
for people who going to war for people
 
02:09:45.149 --> 02:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
and families who whose loved ones are
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
going in times away why are they going
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
to war well that was the point of the
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
Why We Fight series
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
so do you would this preclude or let me
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
ask you put it this way do you think it
 
02:09:59.549 --> 02:09:59.559 align:start position:0%
was wrong for the government to to uh
 
02:10:01.589 --> 02:10:01.599 align:start position:0%
put out the Why We Fight
 
02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
series thank you for the question I
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
would have personally mixed feelings on
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
it just for my personal perspective
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
because on one hand I I'm not
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily opposed to such things as a
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
general patriotic education and things
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
like that um on the other hand there is
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity there for some malfant
 
02:10:22.430 --> 02:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
however it's application to this in
 
02:10:24.189 --> 02:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
particular I can tell you during that
 
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
period of time when that video was
 
02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
released the original smithm Act was
 
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
already in place and it did not prohibit
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
the release of that so this change would
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
not in fact I don't believe prohibit
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing what it does prohibit
 
02:10:41.629 --> 02:10:41.639 align:start position:0%
is utilizing these sort of explicitly
 
02:10:43.629 --> 02:10:43.639 align:start position:0%
information Warfare and propaganda
 
02:10:46.830 --> 02:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
assets I mean as a committee who deals
 
02:10:48.669 --> 02:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
with Veterans Affairs we should all have
 
02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
a basic concept that there are
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
psychological warfare divisions in the
 
02:10:55.229 --> 02:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
United States military that
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
undertake uh strategic deception and
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
other goals in order to try to win and
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
when those kind of assets are turned
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
against the American people that's where
 
02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
we get into some really dangerous
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
territory sure they're called scops and
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
that is part of military strategy some
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
will say scops take place in other
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
venues to include uh I I won't go there
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Lane welcome
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm I'm substitute as you
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
well know uh and thanks for taking my
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
question um I guess info Warfare is such
 
02:11:36.199 --> 02:11:37.270 align:start position:0%
question um I guess info Warfare is such
a

02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
broad term can you give me maybe two
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
examples in during the covid thing that
 
02:11:48.549 --> 02:11:48.559 align:start position:0%
you think that you think of as info
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
Warfare sure thank you for the question
 
02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
so Jo off the bat in information Warfare
 
02:11:55.149 --> 02:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
it is it sounds like something that can
 
02:11:56.589 --> 02:11:56.599 align:start position:0%
be nous term but it is actually
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
something that's reasonably well defined
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
within military Doctrine and includes
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
you know strategic deception toward uh
 
02:12:06.069 --> 02:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
affecting certain goals uh things that
 
02:12:09.310 --> 02:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
would qualify or or did happen under the
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
guise of covid include um significant
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
efforts that were piped from uh this is
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
just actually I'll give you one really
 
02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
good example this is this is ideal so
 
02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
when was a lot of confusion over the
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
initial covid uh appearance and trying
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
to figure out where did this come from
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
what happened here there was immediately
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
a roll out from certain elements within
 
02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:36.559 align:start position:0%
the US government um within certain
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
areas such as the uh the NIH uh DARPA
 
02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
was involved who realized that there was
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually potentially some ties to the US
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
Military and having funded possibly some
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the research that that preceded this
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
whole situation that occurred and
 
02:12:55.149 --> 02:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
immediately we and we know this
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
definitively because of the emails that
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
have been received from these various
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
departments immediately there was
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
efforts to reach out through various
 
02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
actors including through State and other
 
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
departments to contact their mainstream
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
media sources to push this concept that
 
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 originated in a wet Market as a
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
result of some animal incident that
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
happened in in muhan China and they they
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
they immediately sought the down play
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
any possibility that this had anything
 
02:13:25.990 --> 02:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
to do with a laboratory leak because
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
they knew that within their files they
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
had actual um uh proposals that were
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
written to create and do the gain of
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
function research on the Corona virus in
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
question that would come to light if
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
that Wuhan lab uh story broke and they
 
02:13:49.149 --> 02:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
were able to chase down well where that
 
02:13:51.549 --> 02:13:51.559 align:start position:0%
you know where does that lead us so
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
there was an immediate information
 
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
Warfare effort to deceive the American
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
population to where covid came from
 
02:13:59.149 --> 02:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
because people within our own government
 
02:14:01.709 --> 02:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
knew that they may have had a hand in
 
02:14:05.069 --> 02:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
funding the creation of that
 
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
virus other
 
02:14:10.990 --> 02:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing No Hands uh and and
 
02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
having no other pink cards do we have a
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
pink card for the prime smer I do not uh
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
if if you haven't done that
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative if you could because
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's the right thing to do thank you
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
for introducing this uh before I gel us
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
out of session here out of hearing mode
 
02:14:30.990 --> 02:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh I want to point out that this
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have our final measure the
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
16th of 16 that this committee has been
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
tasked with it's the hcr1 on climate so
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
that will commence at 1:00 1300 hours
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
and that's the only one that we have uh
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
I my sense is there may be some u in
 
02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
fact I know there will be some testimony
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
coming coming in on that uh I am the

03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully until crossover represent s uh
 
03:34:49.630 --> 03:34:49.640 align:start position:0%
are are you going to put in a pain card
 
03:34:52.750 --> 03:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh we do as our customers try to
 
03:34:55.870 --> 03:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
give deference to um uh legislators who
 
03:35:00.429 --> 03:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
are who take the time to Comm in
 
03:35:02.429 --> 03:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:35:04.510 --> 03:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
sequence okay and I'll turn the gavl
 
03:35:08.830 --> 03:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Moffett Prime
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor on
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
up oh wait a minute yes sorry about that
 
03:35:40.510 --> 03:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay there you go get after
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
me opening the hearing on hcr1
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
represent M go ahead good thank you
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins get right to it
 
03:35:54.510 --> 03:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
um this is largely a resolution about
 
03:35:58.269 --> 03:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech and about
 
03:36:00.670 --> 03:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
fairness it simply states that we should
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
listen to all sides when forming policy
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
in this case climate policy is lawmakers
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
who deal with climate related bills
 
03:36:14.189 --> 03:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we listen to all sides
 
03:36:17.469 --> 03:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we listen to all sides for any
 
03:36:20.349 --> 03:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
Bill uh it's also as I see it as the
 
03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor see it as an
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
anti-bullying uh resolution s seriously
 
03:36:28.349 --> 03:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll explain that uh there are
 
03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
those of us who feel that the climate
 
03:36:33.630 --> 03:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
alarmists have long been overly
 
03:36:36.389 --> 03:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
successful in defining climate
 
03:36:39.790 --> 03:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
narratives on on their
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
terms uh dramatic claims abound uh to
 
03:36:46.189 --> 03:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
advance those narratives
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
the chair of our Science and Technology
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh not long ago shared a list
 
03:36:52.189 --> 03:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
of around
 
03:36:57.030 --> 03:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
50 50 what he referred to as hysterical
 
03:37:00.110 --> 03:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
climate change claims and predictions
 
03:37:02.750 --> 03:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
none of which came came true all of
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
which proved false I won't go through
 
03:37:08.110 --> 03:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
them here uh but uh they're out there
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
I'll say no earthquakes are not caused
 
03:37:14.229 --> 03:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
by climate change uh and no the the many
 
03:37:16.269 --> 03:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
Canadian wildfire
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
last year were not caused by climate
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
change they were they were caused by
 
03:37:23.950 --> 03:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
arsonists so climate is being blame or
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
climate change man-made climate change
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
is being blamed for anything and
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
everything I'm exaggerating somewhat but
 
03:37:34.389 --> 03:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's part of the impetus behind
 
03:37:34.399 --> 03:37:35.150 align:start position:0%
uh that's part of the impetus behind
this

03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:37:37.349 --> 03:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
resolution uh and of particular interest
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
to the state federal veterans committee
 
03:37:41.630 --> 03:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
would be efforts to force our military
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft to use climate friendly but
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
hugely expensive
 
03:37:51.429 --> 03:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
bofs uh or to mandate the use of battery
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
powered tactical
 
03:37:56.910 --> 03:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
Vehicles then vice president Harris a
 
03:37:59.189 --> 03:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
couple years ago uh excitedly spoke to
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
graduates at the Naval Academy about
 
03:38:07.070 --> 03:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
having Marines carry solar powered
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
blankets as a former Marine Corps
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
infantry men myself I'll say that we
 
03:38:13.469 --> 03:38:13.479 align:start position:0%
make troops and a lot of you know what
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about we already make troops
 
03:38:18.990 --> 03:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
carry way too much weight already
 
03:38:21.630 --> 03:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
without asking to carry solar panels or
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
batteries into combat situations as well
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
so when this climate activism threatens
 
03:38:34.110 --> 03:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
the military procedures and and by
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
extension National Security I think we
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
need to take notice many of us think we
 
03:38:40.469 --> 03:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
need to take notice now we've
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
heard uh I've heard we've heard many
 
03:38:45.990 --> 03:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
times 97% of scientists agree we need
 
03:38:47.550 --> 03:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
climate action
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
now but many of us feel a need to
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
challenge that
 
03:38:55.389 --> 03:38:55.399 align:start position:0%
97% this consensus supposed consensus of
 
03:38:58.590 --> 03:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
scientists who all agree that uh man is
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
changing the climate we need to take
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
climate action
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
now if a scientist holds a healthy
 
03:39:09.790 --> 03:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
skepticism about dramatic climate change
 
03:39:12.269 --> 03:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
claims uh we've seen them labeled as
 
03:39:14.150 --> 03:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
deniers that's something we hear a lot
 
03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
about oh you're a climate denier it's
 
03:39:18.870 --> 03:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
similar to Holocaust denier which is a
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
pejorative term meaning you're denying
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
something that is true and shouldn't be
 
03:39:26.429 --> 03:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
denied and I don't think that people who
 
03:39:29.070 --> 03:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
have some measure of skepticism about
 
03:39:31.550 --> 03:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
some climate claims if they have some
 
03:39:33.990 --> 03:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
questions or Skeptics they shouldn't be
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculed or denounced or called
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
deniers Nobel lauriat Dr John clauser
 
03:39:42.750 --> 03:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
was going to present a seminar on
 
03:39:44.910 --> 03:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
climate models to the IMF that's the
 
03:39:46.750 --> 03:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
international monetary fund who was
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
taking a look at some climate situations
 
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
but he had his talk canell this happens
 
03:39:53.790 --> 03:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
a lot happens on college campuses
 
03:39:57.870 --> 03:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
especially people who have contrary
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
opinions on climate uh get bullied to
 
03:40:04.990 --> 03:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
include a Nobel laurate who had his talk
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
cancelled and that concerns me whatever
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
the position is I I think most of us are
 
03:40:13.790 --> 03:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
free speech Advocates if any opinion
 
03:40:16.590 --> 03:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
gets uh squashed
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
if it gets denounced if it's not allowed
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
to be expressed that's a threat to
 
03:40:21.239 --> 03:40:22.349 align:start position:0%
to be expressed that's a threat to
everybody

03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:40:25.870 --> 03:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever your position
 
03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
is in 2023 a list of 16009 uh you can
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
find this on online
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
169 renowned scientists Scholars and
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
others including engineers and and and
 
03:40:43.349 --> 03:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
others uh 169 people signed a statement
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
that said quote there is no climate
 
03:40:47.120 --> 03:40:49.189 align:start position:0%
that said quote there is no climate
emergency

03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
16009 so should these 169 views be
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
discounted and dismissed and uh shunned
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh here in this body we're asked to
 
03:41:03.070 --> 03:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
impose higher electric rates on granite
 
03:41:06.189 --> 03:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
Staters so as to subsidize what some of
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
us feel are are questionable climate
 
03:41:11.790 --> 03:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
initiatives the climate activists have
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
succeeded in raising electric rates
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
that is a fact fortunately and I give
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
the folks who are experts in this and
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
Science and Technology committee who
 
03:41:27.110 --> 03:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
spent a ton of time on this I give them
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
credit for doing their due diligence and
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
and and making some of the decisions and
 
03:41:35.149 --> 03:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
recommend recommendations that they have
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
vermonts on the other hand in Vermont
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
they've gone
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
way radical uh last term in Vermont they
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
pass measures that are SE seeking to
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
hold uh energy companies liable for
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
climate change in
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
Vermont and the repercussions of that uh
 
03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences are manyfold
 
03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
and and and scary uh Vermont's trying to
 
03:42:06.830 --> 03:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
walk back this bill the the last
 
03:42:09.269 --> 03:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
election saw a lot of the people uh
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's a big change in the Vermont
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
legislature uh last election just this
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
last November in part du
 
03:42:18.070 --> 03:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
to some of the bills that they passed
 
03:42:21.149 --> 03:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
like the one that's going to scare
 
03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
energy companies out of Vermont because
 
03:42:26.349 --> 03:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
if they do business in Vermont they're
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay all this money to
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont to fix climate change in
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont so I think there's a there's a a
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
lesson there for
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
us to pay attention to uh here in New
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not long ago a bill was
 
03:42:45.229 --> 03:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
introduced to ban wood stoves in New
 
03:42:48.189 --> 03:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some of you recall that yeah
 
03:42:49.870 --> 03:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
some folks are coming after our wood
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
stoves and it gets cold here in New
 
03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that measure did not pass
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
but that's the type of mentality that we
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
need to uh acknowledge and and encounter
 
03:43:04.830 --> 03:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
it gets cold in New Hampshire and so and
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
activist climate activists are also
 
03:43:09.630 --> 03:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
working hard to mandate carbon taxes on
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
our businesses All Over America like
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
they have in in Sweden France Portugal
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere California even passed a
 
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
law Banning the sale of gas powered cars
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
after 2035 and there were people in the
 
03:43:24.550 --> 03:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
granded state who wanted in every state
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
who want similar measures to be passed
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
into law to ban the sale of gas
 
03:43:29.640 --> 03:43:30.510 align:start position:0%
into law to ban the sale of gas
powerered

03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
powerered
 
03:43:33.790 --> 03:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
cars it's all some it's already a fact
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
in California but they they have 10
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
years to to get there uh of course I
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time in California
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
climate regulations in California have
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
pushed gas prices presently you know
 
03:43:48.149 --> 03:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
five over $5 a gallon I was there last
 
03:43:51.710 --> 03:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
year and it was some places $6 a gallon
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
$7 a gallon why is California gas so
 
03:43:56.269 --> 03:43:56.279 align:start position:0%
expensive a lot of it's due to climate
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
regulations in that state and who does
 
03:44:01.469 --> 03:44:01.479 align:start position:0%
that hurt the most when you have $6 a
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
gallon gas price the the people who can
 
03:44:05.229 --> 03:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
least afford
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
it then there are carbon credits and
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
carbon allowances the United Nations
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
assigns carbon credit formulas to
 
03:44:13.550 --> 03:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
various countries who are supposed to
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
monitor carbon emissions and report back
 
03:44:18.349 --> 03:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
to the UN organizations can buy carbon
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
credits and they can even sell them if
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
they don't use them
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
all 13 States including most of our
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
neighbors here in the Northeast have are
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
involved in they call it cap and trade
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
programs uh and a lot of you have heard
 
03:44:34.110 --> 03:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
of uh Reggie the regional greenhouse gas
 
03:44:36.750 --> 03:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
gas initiative which I New Hampshire has
 
03:44:40.189 --> 03:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
been able to avoid getting committed to
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh which I I think is good I know some
 
03:44:46.149 --> 03:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
disagree I would sub submit that Reggie
 
03:44:46.159 --> 03:44:48.030 align:start position:0%
disagree I would sub submit that Reggie
and

03:44:48.030 --> 03:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:52.349 --> 03:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
Associated recommendations and and and
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
demands probably have zero impact on our
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
climate but it has made electricity as I
 
03:44:59.710 --> 03:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
said more expensive and inconveniently
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
many climate activists fly around the
 
03:45:03.510 --> 03:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
world in Jets leaving massive carbon
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
Footprints so to counter that they can
 
03:45:08.110 --> 03:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
plant trees to offset their carbon use
 
03:45:11.550 --> 03:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
or they can buy forests as has happened
 
03:45:14.269 --> 03:45:14.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I'm from Coos County so
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
one out ofate entities purchased 146,000
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
Acres of forest up in Coos County up in
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
the North Country so as to engage in
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets and selling carbon
 
03:45:26.990 --> 03:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
credits now these Forest this Forest
 
03:45:28.910 --> 03:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
land that's been Pur you can't cut those
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
trees because they're they're part of
 
03:45:34.309 --> 03:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
selling carbon credits to the to the
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
people who fly these Jets around and
 
03:45:39.710 --> 03:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
need to offset their carbon use by
 
03:45:42.189 --> 03:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
putting our timber in in the North
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
Country uh out of off limits for
 
03:45:48.149 --> 03:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
lumbering for Timber
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
use so ponder that the US has about 4%
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
of the United or 4% of the world
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
population and New Hampshire accounts
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
for less than a half percent of that
 
03:46:02.030 --> 03:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
population so in my view and many of our
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
views all the Reggie initiatives and
 
03:46:07.990 --> 03:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
subsidies and mandates and carbon taxes
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
and carbon credits that they want to
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
impose on graned Staters will have Zero
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
Effect on climate so all the stuff that
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
that people want to do to us uh is going
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
to have zero impact so why do we want to
 
03:46:28.110 --> 03:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh adopt policies and pass bills that
 
03:46:29.830 --> 03:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
like Vermont did like California did
 
03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to hurt in my view our view
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
grand Staters if it if we could know
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
that it's going to make a difference
 
03:46:37.630 --> 03:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but if it's pretty
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
apparent it's going to have zero impact
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
on climate what are we
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
doing and it's such a challenge to raise
 
03:46:46.590 --> 03:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
a Wess about the dangers of climate
 
03:46:48.670 --> 03:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
extremism when the media the so-called
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
clean energy Industries lawmakers
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
alarmists and other activists join
 
03:46:55.990 --> 03:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
forces to squelch those who question
 
03:46:56.000 --> 03:46:58.110 align:start position:0%
forces to squelch those who question
climate

03:46:58.110 --> 03:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
climate
 
03:47:01.070 --> 03:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
Orthodoxy so again I said this is also a
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
bullying measure so I hope we can stop
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
bullying people who are skeptical of
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
climate alarmism so this resolution
 
03:47:12.149 --> 03:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
simply calls for all voices to be heard
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
and for a fair climate debate I want to
 
03:47:17.149 --> 03:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
let other folks testify and you know I
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
know there's other pink cards here um I
 
03:47:21.550 --> 03:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
want to finish by saying that I some of
 
03:47:24.750 --> 03:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
you know I write I I it's what I do I I
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
do a Blog I you've some of you probably
 
03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
seen I have op-eds and opinion pieces uh
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
put words together and the platforms the
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
blogs and daily newspapers have been
 
03:47:40.070 --> 03:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
very good about using stuff I send them
 
03:47:41.790 --> 03:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
maybe because it's good stuff or
 
03:47:46.149 --> 03:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
whatever but uh one local daily with an
 
03:47:48.670 --> 03:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
exception one local daily paper uh
 
03:47:50.590 --> 03:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
refused to run something I wrote about
 
03:47:52.429 --> 03:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
climate now I wrote it in response to
 
03:47:54.469 --> 03:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
some climate alarmism that I just
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
thought needed a response to so I tried
 
03:47:58.429 --> 03:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
to respond and they wouldn't run it they
 
03:48:01.389 --> 03:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
run almost everything I send them good
 
03:48:04.429 --> 03:48:04.439 align:start position:0%
stuff apparently except climate and
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's goes to my point about uh some
 
03:48:08.399 --> 03:48:09.910 align:start position:0%
that's goes to my point about uh some
perspectives

03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:11.990 align:start position:0%
perspectives
being

03:48:11.990 --> 03:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
denied uh the the title of my piece for
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
the mon the local paper was uh 14 points
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
wood Wilson once had 14 points uh at the
 
03:48:25.269 --> 03:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
end of World War I so I picked out 14
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
points regarding the climate I could
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
have picked out 40 but I picked out 14
 
03:48:30.910 --> 03:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
so because I can and because the paper
 
03:48:32.030 --> 03:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
didn't run I'm going to take a couple
 
03:48:33.309 --> 03:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
minutes very quickly and go through
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
those 14 points number one centuries ago
 
03:48:38.149 --> 03:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
during a hotter era Viking settlements
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
thrived on the Greenland Coast
 
03:48:44.070 --> 03:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
Greenland uh global cooling caused their
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
abandonment uh in when it got very cold
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
in Greenland I guess we're back in
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
Greenland but uh so why weren't those
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
Coastal communities inundated by higher
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
sea levels uh during those much warmer
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
times number two in 1999 climate
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
researcher Michael man his climate work
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
was cited all over the world to support
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
anti-global warming policies his claims
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
were later repudiated he's a Canadian in
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
the Canadian court but man the scientist
 
03:49:14.910 --> 03:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
man refused to share his data or his
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
methodology and so he lost the case and
 
03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
had to pay court costs because he
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support he wouldn't Supply the
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
methodology to support his claims number
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
three conspiratorial climatologist
 
03:49:27.910 --> 03:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
correspondents in the UK included an
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
email from man Michael man which
 
03:49:33.910 --> 03:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
chillingly suggested finding a friendly
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
investigative journalist to expose
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
skeptical scientists like Steve McIntyre
 
03:49:43.309 --> 03:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
classic bullying okay McIntyre is a very
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
highly regarded climate ologist who had
 
03:49:47.790 --> 03:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
a contrary view so they tried to take
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
him out they tried to have friendly
 
03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
media people uh take him on and uh
 
03:49:53.159 --> 03:49:54.510 align:start position:0%
media people uh take him on and uh
expose

03:49:54.510 --> 03:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
expose
 
03:49:56.910 --> 03:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
him IR number four ironically
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%

endorsed by many or most presidential
 
03:50:53.389 --> 03:50:53.399 align:start position:0%

green New Deal
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%

endorse the green New Deal which would

impose stifling government regulation to

03:51:22.670 --> 03:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
to proposals like the green New Deal and
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
all that goes with it number nine our
 
03:51:28.030 --> 03:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
climate changes constantly always has
 
03:51:30.590 --> 03:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
always will but no one can state with
 
03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
certainty the precise impact humans have
 
03:51:36.269 --> 03:51:36.279 align:start position:0%
on such change and aside uh I am not a
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
climate denier I agree the climate
 
03:51:41.950 --> 03:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
changes always has always will the the
 
03:51:45.389 --> 03:51:45.399 align:start position:0%
big issue is uh how much
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
does mankind impact climate change
 
03:51:51.149 --> 03:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
there's a spectrum of thought on that no
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
no one can say
 
03:51:56.110 --> 03:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
precisely uh number 10 uh that humans
 
03:51:59.950 --> 03:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
can change our climate is is quite
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
presumptuous a Sports Illustrated piece
 
03:52:04.910 --> 03:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
on shorter P pond hockey seasons in
 
03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
Canada proposed that we quote cool our
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
planet as soon as possible so even
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
Sports writers are compromised calling
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
for us to cool our planet uh number 11
 
03:52:20.229 --> 03:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
almost done uh Mother Nature can indeed
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
cool the earth a catoa style volcanic
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
eruption would spew many millions of
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
tons of Ash into the atmosphere block
 
03:52:30.269 --> 03:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
sunlight lower temperatures this
 
03:52:32.429 --> 03:52:32.439 align:start position:0%
occurred a number of times our four
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
major ice ages many think or due to
 
03:52:37.870 --> 03:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
massive volcanic eruptions that block
 
03:52:41.070 --> 03:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
the Sun and then we had ice ages a
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
little ice age occurred in
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
1816 a year with summer there was a
 
03:52:47.750 --> 03:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
massive eruption in Mount
 
03:52:50.469 --> 03:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
Timor and uh lower temperatures for a
 
03:52:52.110 --> 03:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
year it's here in New Hampshire it
 
03:52:55.229 --> 03:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
snowed every month and crops are ruined
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
this is when people got the heck out of
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because they couldn't
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
raise crops and they moved to Tennessee
 
03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
wherever it's called 1816 and froze to
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
death if you want to look that up uh
 
03:53:08.750 --> 03:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
that cooling happened not because of
 
03:53:11.710 --> 03:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
mankind it happened because of Mother
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
Nature and it leads want to wonder if if
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
mankind is indeed warming the planet
 
03:53:23.269 --> 03:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
which many claim uh some are skeptical
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
if we if we are doing that and we warn
 
03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
the planet by a degree or two would that
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
temper or counter the next major
 
03:53:32.149 --> 03:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
volcanic eruption would it save us from
 
03:53:34.389 --> 03:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
nice stes I don't know just putting that
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
out there okay number 12 the media
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
Embrace climate climate change stories
 
03:53:42.590 --> 03:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
because sensationalism gets attention
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
but if one does some digging one notes
 
03:53:46.990 --> 03:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
that many climate op ads are written by
 
03:53:50.189 --> 03:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
solar or wind power folks who stand to
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from mandated reductions and F
 
03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel use of course the people who
 
03:53:57.510 --> 03:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
make batteries and so solar panels and
 
03:53:59.630 --> 03:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
windmills and all that of course it's in
 
03:54:02.110 --> 03:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
their best interest to scare people and
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
create a demand for their
 
03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
products uh number 13 uh scientists get
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
more attention and more grant money if
 
03:54:11.590 --> 03:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's a climate crisis so of course
 
03:54:13.950 --> 03:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
it's in their best interest to make the
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
case we have a crisis and finally number
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
14 uh political movements this politics
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
of this of course political movements
 
03:54:23.590 --> 03:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
need energy and we need to admit that
 
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
climate change activism is exploited by
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
some to Advanced agendas many folks now
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
associate climate change not just with
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
earthquakes but with everything else
 
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
from cow flatulence to militarism to
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
racism to sexism related to climate
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
change uh so the politics of climate
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
change is very real so uh there's much
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
more than these 14 points but as censo
 
03:54:50.990 --> 03:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
said of woodro Wilson's 14 Points even
 
03:54:53.149 --> 03:54:53.159 align:start position:0%
God had only ten commandments so thank
 
03:54:57.030 --> 03:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
you I'll stop there the climate is
 
03:55:00.110 --> 03:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
changing and humans are part of the mix
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
I just said
 
03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
that but a measured transition away from
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels is I think
 
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
desirable but a measured transition not
 
03:55:15.389 --> 03:55:15.399 align:start position:0%
a radical transition and as we move
 
03:55:17.550 --> 03:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
forward we should make decisions based
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
Less on bullying and more on reason and
 
03:55:23.070 --> 03:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
and mutual respect thank you for your
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
time I'd be happy to take questions if
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:55:26.159 --> 03:55:29.510 align:start position:0%
there are
any

03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.830 --> 03:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
03:55:35.550 --> 03:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
cber yeah thanks for taking my question
 
03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
um I guess um so are you aware that
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
meteorologists when it comes to bullying
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
meteorologists or with a doubt on the
 
03:55:47.830 --> 03:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
Forefront of that when it is their job
 
03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
to to report on the weather and they
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's essentially a consensus on that
 
03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
when it comes to meteorologists except
 
03:55:57.910 --> 03:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
the one who was threatened by their job
 
03:55:59.110 --> 03:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
on Fox
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
News so to um stop reporting um and
 
03:56:06.389 --> 03:56:06.399 align:start position:0%
using the term climate change and yeah
 
03:56:09.910 --> 03:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
and refers to that so um so I feel like
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
when there's bullying would you not say
 
03:56:14.630 --> 03:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's enough to go around on both
 
03:56:16.710 --> 03:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
sides and it's a little unfair to Target
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
one side about that sure thank you for
 
03:56:22.269 --> 03:56:22.279 align:start position:0%
the question and comment uh as I said I
 
03:56:26.550 --> 03:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
bullying whatever the issue is I I I
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
condemn I want everybody to be able to
 
03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
give expression and of course here where
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
we debate and discuss and challenge each
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
other that's our job uh so we're kind of
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
used to it here but uh to your point you
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned meteorologist now
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
meteorologists are are weather people
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
weather men whether WEA reporters uh as
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to climatologist and uh and I'll
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
Grant uh I I read up on this somewhat
 
03:56:56.269 --> 03:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
and a preponderance of
 
03:56:58.670 --> 03:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
climatologists seem to have given
 
03:57:01.229 --> 03:57:01.239 align:start position:0%
expression to the belief that man cause
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
climate change is an issue and I I I
 
03:57:07.110 --> 03:57:07.120 align:start position:0%
respect their opinions and they they may
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
be correct but to my earlier Point
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's meteorologists or
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
climatologists uh having back and forth
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's a spectrum even amongst
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
meteorologists or climatologists they
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
don't all agree precisely on how much
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
mankind or humans humankind impacts the
 
03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh the climate so uh I I take your point
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
and I think it's fair to expect uh you
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
know people to give some due deference
 
03:57:38.550 --> 03:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
to experts meteorologist climatologist
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
while acknowledging that they don't all
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
agree and consensus is not a scientific
 
03:57:45.910 --> 03:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
term consensus is when most people get
 
03:57:48.189 --> 03:57:48.199 align:start position:0%
together and they pretty much agree in
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
general uh but that's not how science
 
03:57:53.590 --> 03:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
Works science is very specific and uh
 
03:57:56.710 --> 03:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
you can have data and conflicting data
 
03:57:59.790 --> 03:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a consensus i' be careful about
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
science further questions representative
 
03:58:10.189 --> 03:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair if it's okay
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.630 --> 03:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for presenting this
 
03:58:20.189 --> 03:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh most of our our
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
resolutions finish up uh with the last
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
line saying who they want to go to and
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say anything it does do you
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
want it to the federal New Hampshire's
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
Federal delegation do you don't want it
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
to go to the Full House and Senate do
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
you want it to go to the
 
03:58:36.670 --> 03:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
president thank thank you represent it's
 
03:58:38.910 --> 03:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
a great question uh it's a concurrent
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
resolution we would have to go to the
 
03:58:42.870 --> 03:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
Senate and if it if it did pass both
 
03:58:45.990 --> 03:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
bodies uh then it would be incumbent on
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
the uh leadership of both bodies to
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
share that and that's something that
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
this if it passes the sponsors would
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
take it take the initiative to make sure
 
03:58:56.550 --> 03:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
that it was shared with the federal
 
03:58:58.750 --> 03:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
delegation uh I I agree I think it would
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
have been better like many other
 
03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
resolutions to specifically state that a
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
copy would go to uh the who or whatever
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
so uh so it's going to be up to the
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
supporters to uh uh promulgate this if
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
it passes okay I just want to know who
 
03:59:16.750 --> 03:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
we were writing to thank
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent representative
 
03:59:23.870 --> 03:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question so are I've been
 
03:59:26.990 --> 03:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
reading a lot of these studies I don't
 
03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
know if you have uh but there's some
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
talking about like the climate anxiety
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
with the upcoming generation would you
 
03:59:34.269 --> 03:59:34.279 align:start position:0%
say that we should not be legislating uh
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
the fear into the the children for
 
03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
things like this thank you for
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
mentioning that rub some Manion I was
 
03:59:41.110 --> 03:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
going to mention that and I I already
 
03:59:44.910 --> 03:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
had too many words um but kids are being
 
03:59:47.710 --> 03:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
scared to death uh there there's all
 
03:59:49.309 --> 03:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
kinds of anecdotal and statistical
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
information you know youngsters today
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
growing up this is hovering over their
 
03:59:55.149 --> 03:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
head the world's going to the world is
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
in danger uh there's a climate crisis uh
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
we're all going to die uh and I I'm I'm
 
04:00:02.790 --> 04:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
being a little bit uh hyperbolic but not
 
04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
much that's a great Point that's a
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
concern that I'm glad you brought up
 
04:00:09.149 --> 04:00:09.159 align:start position:0%
because uh we're scaring our kids and
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we need to be
 
04:00:16.990 --> 04:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lane um thank you and
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I just
 
04:00:24.030 --> 04:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to you had mentioned
 
04:00:27.030 --> 04:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday's um Bill about the definition
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
of clean energy and I just wanted to
 
04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
remind and I have to do this in a
 
04:00:35.790 --> 04:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
question but when representative mcke
 
04:00:38.349 --> 04:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
spoke on the floor she made it very
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
clear that she was not voting against
 
04:00:43.229 --> 04:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
nuclear energy and wanted it to be
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
included what she W do you recall what
 
04:00:48.670 --> 04:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
she said she was concerned
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
about yes I thought that was a very good
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
exchange yesterday uh representative
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
McGee explained her concern with what
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
was trying to move forward and she was
 
04:01:03.389 --> 04:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
not opposed to nuclear power uh but if
 
04:01:06.830 --> 04:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead if I can M Mr Vice
 
04:01:09.110 --> 04:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
chair if I can ask her to make sure that
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
we're clear on on the point there that
 
04:01:12.590 --> 04:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
what was said yesterday in the house
 
04:01:15.070 --> 04:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
floor sure
 
04:01:17.550 --> 04:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
and my recollection and again it's a
 
04:01:20.429 --> 04:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
recollection is that she wanted to have
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
she regretted that did not have time to
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
work on a better definition and wanted
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
it and was not happy that we were in the
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
position of having to change it on the
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
floor and she did not want anything
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
that's usually considered to be a quote
 
04:01:40.349 --> 04:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's low emissions or
 
04:01:42.710 --> 04:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
dirty emissions I'm not an expert but
 
04:01:44.750 --> 04:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
she did not want that in included in the
 
04:01:46.590 --> 04:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
definition and was hoping that they
 
04:01:49.149 --> 04:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
could reach a better to use the other
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
word consensus on the um definition
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's my recollection of the gist of
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
what she was saying would you say that
 
04:02:00.030 --> 04:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's an incorrect no I think you
 
04:02:01.870 --> 04:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
characterized it pretty well I I thought
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
represent McGee and and the chair
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
represent Vos were both very good at
 
04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
explaining their perspectives I thought
 
04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
they were both very uh uh knowledgeable
 
04:02:12.670 --> 04:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
to feel they're both in Science and Tech
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
energy and uh yeah so I guess my point
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
in mentioning that this came to the
 
04:02:20.189 --> 04:02:20.199 align:start position:0%
floor yesterday uh and I don't want to
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
have that misconstrued the my greater
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
point was that even yesterday we were
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the the uh issue of
 
04:02:29.389 --> 04:02:29.399 align:start position:0%
nuclear power being clean energy and I'm
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
trying to think of the terms are used as
 
04:02:34.510 --> 04:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
clean uh uh I'm trying to remember the
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
two terms uh that they were talking
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
about but uh yeah my greater point was
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
just that we were talking about it and I
 
04:02:43.309 --> 04:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
I think both I think the world of both
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
represent G representative votes and and
 
04:02:47.229 --> 04:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
and I thought was a very interesting
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
exchange and and uh and a good vote in
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.910 --> 04:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
questions oh yep sorry representative
 
04:02:59.479 --> 04:03:01.149 align:start position:0%
questions oh yep sorry representative
Duan

04:03:01.149 --> 04:03:01.159 align:start position:0%
Duan
 
04:03:04.389 --> 04:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you uh and thank you uh for
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in order to
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
maintain a healthy level of skepticism
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
don't you think it's natural for
 
04:03:15.149 --> 04:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
scientists to agree with whoever is
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
funding them thank you for the question
 
04:03:19.590 --> 04:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
I kind of touched on that it's a little
 
04:03:23.950 --> 04:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
bit of a uh that that notion that people
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
are being bought uh is goes both ways uh
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh I guess the your greater point is is
 
04:03:35.950 --> 04:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
money influencing some activities and
 
04:03:40.750 --> 04:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
energy and I think of course uh how much
 
04:03:43.870 --> 04:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
uh money impacts positions that people
 
04:03:45.550 --> 04:03:45.560 align:start position:0%
take is there's no way to measure that
 
04:03:48.269 --> 04:03:48.279 align:start position:0%
but yeah I think uh moneyed interests
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
they're having a big impact on the
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
debate yes I agree thank
 
04:03:56.149 --> 04:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
you any further questions seeing none
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mafa good job
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair and keeping the
 
04:04:02.429 --> 04:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
traditions in this in this committee
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask to have their
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
representatives come up testify first so
 
04:04:09.630 --> 04:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
Tim hornan would you come to the seat
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
and Tim has asked for two minutes and he
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm representing Timothy Oregon from
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10 and two
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
small bits of background is I was a
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
civilian employed the Army cor cor of
 
04:04:25.229 --> 04:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
Engineers a number of year working on
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
climate change issues and the climate
 
04:04:29.189 --> 04:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
has continued to change since then that
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
was about and also like I'm I was around
 
04:04:35.070 --> 04:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm old enough to remember well first
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
of all the Three Mile Island Disaster in
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
19 in the late 1970s and then also um
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
the uh fight over the seab brook nuclear
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
power PL so to get to the uh nuclear
 
04:04:47.630 --> 04:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
power plants the idea that's clean
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
energy I mean the technology may have
 
04:04:51.110 --> 04:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
its place but the idea that's clean
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
energy is kind of ludicrous uh we really
 
04:04:55.870 --> 04:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
haven't solved the problem of what to do
 
04:04:57.389 --> 04:04:57.399 align:start position:0%
with the waste and the other dangers so
 
04:05:00.189 --> 04:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
it's actually it's a technology that may
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
have some promise but it's still
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous um even if it
 
04:05:06.269 --> 04:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh release any carbon and the
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
idea that it's renewable um it's about
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
the least renewable source of energy
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
there is so as for the um as for the
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
climate change yes the climate has
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
changed dramatically before humans come
 
04:05:19.630 --> 04:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
along it's changing now and that's
 
04:05:21.189 --> 04:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's a re you know that's just a
 
04:05:23.710 --> 04:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
reality we only have this one planet the
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
human race only has this one planet to
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
live on I know Deputy president mus
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
wants to make us multiplanetary but that
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's a long way away from country to
 
04:05:34.469 --> 04:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
fruition I really don't think that can
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
ever happen certainly not happening now
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
so you we don't have any there is no
 
04:05:41.229 --> 04:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
Planet B there aren't any other planets
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
we can we can go to there's just this
 
04:05:44.990 --> 04:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
one planet it and we really should be as
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
careful as
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
possible possible with it and um
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
finally um we're talking about the
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
scientists being uh you know bought out
 
04:05:58.149 --> 04:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
and it's true you know the funding is
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
part of it but that's true also for the
 
04:06:00.910 --> 04:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies the only
 
04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
difference is the fossil fuel companies
 
04:06:04.149 --> 04:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
they run by corporate Executives so
 
04:06:06.990 --> 04:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
they're and they do a f fiary interest
 
04:06:08.189 --> 04:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
to pursue you know the goal of
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
maximizing shareholder value and I I
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
will assume that they must I will I
 
04:06:14.910 --> 04:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
won't necessarily just dispute the myth
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
that they do so with perfect objectivity
 
04:06:19.149 --> 04:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
out of the goodness of their hearts but
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so I would just say and also so I
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
would just say this this resolution the
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
idea behind it is bad and also like the
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
way it's drafted we're not really I'm
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
amazed it even got through the drafting
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
process because uh we're sending a
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
resolution to who no one so obviously
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
this committee if they want to go
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
forward to it they'll have to either
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
amend it or rely on the other body to
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
amend it but the other body has a his
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
has of not even accepting hcrs so this I
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
would just say I probably I've already
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
wasted about 2 minutes might well spent
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
about 2 minutes of my time talking on it
 
04:06:54.830 --> 04:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
so I think probably this is not
 
04:06:56.590 --> 04:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
something that's worth you know a large
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
amount of the committee's time because
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know we're sending this meaningless
 
04:07:02.349 --> 04:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
and false resolution based on
 
04:07:05.189 --> 04:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
questionable premises to who to no one
 
04:07:06.990 --> 04:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
no one really cares no one's really
 
04:07:09.030 --> 04:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
going to change what they do based on uh
 
04:07:13.870 --> 04:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.110 --> 04:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
question go ahead question oh thank you
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan yeah so if no one
 
04:07:22.469 --> 04:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
really cares why are you here um I was
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually here for another bill across
 
04:07:26.149 --> 04:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
the hall about school lunch I mean I did
 
04:07:28.030 --> 04:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
see this thing and said this is just
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
wacky like why you know I was amazed
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
even that it got through the drafting
 
04:07:34.269 --> 04:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
process and when I was a rookie rep
 
04:07:36.070 --> 04:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
freshman rep I think I had a resolution
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
about something and uh the drafter a
 
04:07:40.269 --> 04:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful man named Paul Lindstrom who I
 
04:07:42.510 --> 04:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
think is retired he said well here's
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
your proposal like you know if you
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
suppos a resolution you you're supposed
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be notifying someone exhorting
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
someone you know who is this resolution
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
directed to and I thought about it and I
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure so he I agreed that maybe my
 
04:07:58.349 --> 04:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
idea was bad so I'm this was the same
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
problem with this proposal when we
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
brought it into the drafting attorney he
 
04:08:05.750 --> 04:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
he or she probably forgot to ask um who
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
are we ex you know who are we directing
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
this to who are we exhorting who are we
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
acing action from um you know so that's
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks uh further questions
 
04:08:18.109 --> 04:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
representative plans thank you Mr Vice
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
being here thank you for your testimony
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
so you stated nuclear isn't clean energy
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
due to its waste um it's also finite and
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
not renewable what do you say to the
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
waste created for landfills from old
 
04:08:36.030 --> 04:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
solar panels and massive Abominations we
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
call windmills um I I I don't think the
 
04:08:41.950 --> 04:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
windmills or solar panels that bad but
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
the materials are at least in theory
 
04:08:46.950 --> 04:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh can be recycled more and they're not
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh they're not radioactive the way
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
nuclear waste is so I I just um disagree
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand where you're coming
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
from I know where those talking points
 
04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
are coming from but I I simply do not
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
agree with them so and um I think it's
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very small problem nuclear waste
 
04:09:04.189 --> 04:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
I mean n like the cabb nuclear power
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
plant some of that waste you know we're
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
going to have to find some
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
way to wait you know hundreds or even
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of years before it the
 
04:09:15.389 --> 04:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
radioactivity decays to a point where
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's safe to handle and we really um
 
04:09:20.550 --> 04:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
there really is no particularly good
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
plan for for dealing with it and
 
04:09:24.790 --> 04:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
especially if we actually this and
 
04:09:27.510 --> 04:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
especially if we then begin nuclear
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
power which has been a fairly small uh
 
04:09:31.550 --> 04:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we sort of a dead end in
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
technological Evolution so if it becomes
 
04:09:35.550 --> 04:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
a big deal again um you know then we'll
 
04:09:37.469 --> 04:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
have like exponentially more times that
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
waste to deal with representative any
 
04:09:39.479 --> 04:09:40.830 align:start position:0%
waste to deal with representative any
further

04:09:40.830 --> 04:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
04:09:44.750 --> 04:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thanks remember we only have
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
that one planet
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
so okay next on the agenda is Matthew
 
04:09:54.269 --> 04:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
Kellan did I say that right and he
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and is asking for four
 
04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
minutes good afternoon chair Mofford and
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Matthew Kain um
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
I represent myself today um as a
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
concerned C citizen I'm currently
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
self-employed as a health consultant and
 
04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
teach part-time at Antioch University I
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
support The Proposal with some a few
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions my qualifications is really
 
04:10:22.870 --> 04:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
a master's degree in public health from
 
04:10:26.670 --> 04:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
um UCLA um three decades of working um
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
with state and local offics within state
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
government collaborating with state and
 
04:10:33.389 --> 04:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
federal affili on on research um I've
 
04:10:35.229 --> 04:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
done a few peer- reviewed um
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
publications related to climate um and
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
the project um number of projects at a
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
local level trying to reach out and
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
trying to help communities adapt to
 
04:10:45.950 --> 04:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
climate change um I'm concerned about
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
climate change for a couple different
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
reasons well first I'm an outdoors
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
person I can really see the change in
 
04:10:53.349 --> 04:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
our longer summers U more intense
 
04:10:55.349 --> 04:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
shorter Winters and certainly the
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
expansion of of tick habitat and I'll
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
talk more about that um I believe the
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
other concern though really as a
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
scientist I'm concerned about the
 
04:11:04.870 --> 04:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
misperception of the consensus around
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
climate change um its causes as impacts
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
and solutions um more about that I
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
believe we have a lot of high quality
 
04:11:13.630 --> 04:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
evidence about the causes of climate
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
change there's a lot of consensus there
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
um there's some strong evidence for the
 
04:11:19.950 --> 04:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
impacts certainly around the idea of
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events and and uh not
 
04:11:24.030 --> 04:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
extreme weather events sorry um extreme
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
heat events um those are that strong um
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
but there's less strong evidence for
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
revivable Solutions and I think it's
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
important to know when we talk about a
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
consensus around climate change we're
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
talking about just that first Pete on
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
the causes and the impacts um and the
 
04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
solutions to those are still really in
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
within that s scientific Arena where we
 
04:11:44.269 --> 04:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
need to explore them more and understand
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
them so how does climate change um
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
impact Public Health I worked on it for
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
10 years through the New Hampshire DHHS
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
um and the evidence points to kind of
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
three main impacts um from climate
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
change in New Hampshire first is Vector
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
born disease I think we can really uh
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that because of the slight
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
warming and because of um more um uh
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
precipitation um tick habitat has
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
expanded and tick born disease has done
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
that some of the best studies look at 10
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
to 30 % of tick born disease is probably
 
04:12:17.229 --> 04:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
related to climate change in some way
 
04:12:18.510 --> 04:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
when I say climate change I mean
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
anthropogenic climate change right
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
something is happening because of human
 
04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
causes um the second main impact is
 
04:12:26.349 --> 04:12:26.359 align:start position:0%
mental health and somebody's already
 
04:12:28.349 --> 04:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned this um climate driven
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
disasters can lead to short-term mental
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
stress and also long-term disorders
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
longer warming seasons and shorter
 
04:12:36.630 --> 04:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
Winters um also really impact our
 
04:12:39.870 --> 04:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
outdoor workers um and impact um the
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
ability of ski industry uh Forestry
 
04:12:44.910 --> 04:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
Landscaping to do their job and that can
 
04:12:47.109 --> 04:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
be really stressful on those uh business
 
04:12:49.149 --> 04:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
people and their workers and finally
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
climate change has impact on traumatic
 
04:12:53.349 --> 04:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
injuries um and Heat injury I
 
04:12:55.030 --> 04:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
co-authored a study with Plymouth State
 
04:12:57.389 --> 04:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
University peers where we looked at that
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
we didn't find a huge significant impact
 
04:13:01.109 --> 04:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
but on those days where we had extreme
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
events all cause injuries went up that
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense in a way right we're
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
Outdoors we're playing we're working
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing things it makes sense how
 
04:13:09.670 --> 04:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
much of that is driven by climate change
 
04:13:11.710 --> 04:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to discover in that
 
04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
research um so in summary you know we're
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
adapting to climate change and I think
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
we have we can kind of show that we have
 
04:13:20.670 --> 04:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that and that's
 
04:13:22.349 --> 04:13:22.359 align:start position:0%
positive that I think addresses some of
 
04:13:23.469 --> 04:13:23.479 align:start position:0%
that mental health that there's
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions out
 
04:13:27.189 --> 04:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
there how climate change alarmism
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
affects Public Health this is something
 
04:13:30.510 --> 04:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
that isn't talked about much um an
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
alarmist approach to climate advocacy
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
can Nega negatively impact Mental Health
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
and Social Unity gets people it's a very
 
04:13:38.950 --> 04:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
polarizing issue recent surveys of Youth
 
04:13:41.670 --> 04:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
only almost 70% across the world
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually said that they are extremely
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
worried or very worried about climate
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
change climate researchers and media
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
reports as people mentioned here often
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
present the worst case
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
scenario um and uh climate Africa is
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
also downplay the known improvements in
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
environmental conditions we've all
 
04:13:58.750 --> 04:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
invested a lot in better air quality and
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
better water quality with real health
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
benefits um an example is climate has
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
warmed over the last 50 years but
 
04:14:08.030 --> 04:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
evidence shows a significant decrease in
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
heat related deaths especially in our
 
04:14:11.670 --> 04:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
cities it's getting warmer and we're
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
doing better the the research is I'm
 
04:14:15.389 --> 04:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
going to say complicated but some
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes contradictory and people need
 
04:14:19.149 --> 04:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
to know that in addition we've been able
 
04:14:20.590 --> 04:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
to improve air quality and reduce
 
04:14:22.750 --> 04:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
pollution related deaths by over 100,000
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
a year a young people need to hear this
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
they learn need to learn that history to
 
04:14:29.309 --> 04:14:29.319 align:start position:0%
improve their mental health gain hope
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
and be productive members of our society
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
um how this bill could be improved um I
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
believe this resolation can be improved
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
by changing the words fraudulent and
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
intimidation to more neutral terms even
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
if those words are accurate in some rare
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
cases it's like as that cause more
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
division appear biased and limit
 
04:14:45.720 --> 04:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
division appear biased and limit
bipartisan

04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan
 
04:14:48.870 --> 04:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
support now how this bill could
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
encourage better dialogue and maybe less
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
debate um if this resolution passes both
 
04:14:54.910 --> 04:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
houses in the Senate I encourage you to
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
engage with peers from the granite
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
Bridge Alliance led by representative
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
Fred plat from g toown New Hampshire
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan group is dedicated to
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
Reaching Across the aisle to improve
 
04:15:06.510 --> 04:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
dialogue I'd be happy to work with this
 
04:15:08.269 --> 04:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
legislature anybody who wants to work on
 
04:15:11.070 --> 04:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
that for the issue of climate in closing
 
04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
this resolution is focused on the topic
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
of climate shap this it also brings to
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
light this polarization of our political
 
04:15:18.910 --> 04:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
views I hope we can use this as an
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to engage in thoughtful
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
dialogue and move away from that
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
reactive debate we need more honest
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
Brokers involved with the climate
 
04:15:28.590 --> 04:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
dialogue people um who view it as a work
 
04:15:30.630 --> 04:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
in progress with all the gaps
 
04:15:32.830 --> 04:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and healthy skepticism that
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
scientific Endeavors deserve um thank
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
you for considering my views on climate
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
information and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
questions or address comments do we have
 
04:15:45.870 --> 04:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.550 --> 04:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
no questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.950 --> 04:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
testimony now I'd like to call up
 
04:15:55.710 --> 04:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
Matthew Kell oh no that's the one I just
 
04:15:58.269 --> 04:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
did sorry John Gage five has asked for
 
04:16:00.189 --> 04:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
five minutes and he is opposed to the
 
04:16:00.199 --> 04:16:14.830 align:start position:0%
five minutes and he is opposed to the
bill

04:16:14.830 --> 04:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee uh
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the testimony we
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
just heard and if significant changes
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
were made I would support the bill uh
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
the title sounds extremely reasonable to
 
04:16:27.750 --> 04:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
me and something that we should be doing
 
04:16:30.030 --> 04:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's the whereas Clauses that I disagree
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
with one of my handouts goes through
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
changes that I would
 
04:16:36.750 --> 04:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
make it seems to me that the New
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Legislature is
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
unwittingly doing the bidding of outof
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
State polluters this session
 
04:16:45.109 --> 04:16:45.119 align:start position:0%
some people in positions of leadership
 
04:16:47.389 --> 04:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
have been tricked by a decades long
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
two-faced game by an outof State
 
04:16:52.750 --> 04:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
polluter industry for example one of the
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill has attended 16
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
conferences around the country funded by
 
04:17:00.990 --> 04:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
a group of fossil fuel billionaires and
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
free market fundamentalists collectively
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
known as the coch network their money
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
funds front groups who are brilliant
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
brilliant at PR the groups call
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
themselves conservative think tanks but
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
in reality they are propaganda outfits
 
04:17:21.269 --> 04:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
PR firms they hide a rotten core uh for
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
polluters under a thin veneer of
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate conservative values they are

their misunderstandings about basic

climate science straightened out last
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
week he told me that he would do it on
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
his terms he hasn't done it yet but if
 
04:19:23.070 --> 04:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
he had maybe this bill would have been
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
retracted or or
 
04:19:29.070 --> 04:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
modified I am alarmed about climate

the theory of agw as most likely

all climate anxiety was mentioned uh

about our youth we don't want to scare

the youth but they're learning about
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
science in school they are learning
 
04:21:03.790 --> 04:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
about the pollution from fossil fuels
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
causing a long-term problem in their

future hiding this from them is not
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
doing them a

favor this the language in this bill
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
would cause climate anxiety in a youth
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
um downplaying the seriousness of the
 
04:21:23.109 --> 04:21:23.119 align:start position:0%
problem and uh using language that makes
 
04:21:25.109 --> 04:21:25.119 align:start position:0%
it sound like taking this matter
 
04:21:27.790 --> 04:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
seriously is unre
 
04:21:30.309 --> 04:21:30.319 align:start position:0%

04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
special interests have assumed far too
 
04:21:38.590 --> 04:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
much power in our political system in
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
Democratic countries the power should be
 
04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
with the voter not with the people who
 
04:21:45.030 --> 04:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
have the money that requires fixing some
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
of our democracies including the
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
US public sentiment is firmly against
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
the pro- fossil fuel anti-science

us the major bills heard by the science

04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
and against Bad fossil fuel favorable

bills and every vote by the majority
 
04:22:25.389 --> 04:22:25.399 align:start position:0%

players know about the damages they are
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
causing but they just don't seem to care
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
enough to overwhelm the massive profits

fraud negligence and use of money to
 
04:22:50.229 --> 04:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
exploit the scientific ignorance of the

public and leaders to manipulate

policies in our Modern
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
Age I'm embarrassed that our state's
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
science committee majority members have
 
04:23:01.830 --> 04:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
let themselves be tricked by polluter
 
04:23:04.750 --> 04:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
industry PR in this way this bill is an
 
04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
affront to all the citizens of New
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who respect the scientific
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
consensus about agw and who are
 
04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
understandably worried about what global
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
warming from fossil fuel pollution means
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
for them and their
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
children public sentiment is
 
04:23:23.309 --> 04:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
clear influence is
 
04:23:25.870 --> 04:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
clear New Hampshire is not even a fossil
 
04:23:28.189 --> 04:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
fuel producing state we have much to
 
04:23:30.269 --> 04:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
gain from the global transition from a
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel powered world to an clean
 
04:23:35.229 --> 04:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
energy powered world we have the
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the technology the
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
educated Workforce that can produce the
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
Clean Energy Solutions we're never going
 
04:23:43.550 --> 04:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
to PO we're never going to produce the
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
polluting fossil fuel
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
Solutions so why are some New Hampshire
 
04:23:51.550 --> 04:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
leaders participating in the bad actor
 
04:23:52.950 --> 04:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
part of the fossil fuel industry's
 
04:23:56.109 --> 04:23:56.119 align:start position:0%
two-phased game they've been tricked by
 
04:23:58.830 --> 04:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
the C Network's promoted ideology of
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
free market
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
fundamentalism an extremist Viewpoint
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
that the government should stay out of
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
markets no regulations should be imposed
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
to protect human health or the
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
environment the market will act
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
responsibly all by itself unguided by
 
04:24:16.269 --> 04:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
policy but economists understand that is
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
wrong when pollution is free we get too
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
much of it it is the role of government
 
04:24:24.269 --> 04:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
to set the rules that protect people the
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
biodiversity and ecological Services we

all depend on and our property from
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
being harmed by someone else's economic
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
activity to address the cases of the
 
04:24:36.429 --> 04:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
tragedy to address this case of the
 
04:24:38.030 --> 04:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
tragedy of the
 
04:24:45.149 --> 04:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.030 --> 04:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
hcr1 is a human-caused climate change
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
deniers bill as indicated by the whereas
 
04:24:53.550 --> 04:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
Clauses the granite geek wrote this
 
04:24:55.990 --> 04:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
about it a New Hampshire Bill pretends
 
04:24:57.950 --> 04:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
climate change doesn't exist because it
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
is too scary to face but the premise of
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
the title of this bill that it would be
 
04:25:05.950 --> 04:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
a good idea to consider all the costs of
 
04:25:07.630 --> 04:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
pollution from fossil fuels and state
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
decisions is a good one let's turn it
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
around explain the wording is extremist
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
and alienating anti-science and talk
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
about external costs and the need to
 
04:25:21.070 --> 04:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
accept the scientific consensus about
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
global warming from fossil fuel
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
pollution as identified in the 2022 New
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire climate assessment report and
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
the United States Global change research
 
04:25:32.910 --> 04:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
program's fifth National Climate
 
04:25:36.269 --> 04:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
assessment we need science-based policy
 
04:25:38.469 --> 04:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
not ideology-driven
 
04:25:40.429 --> 04:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
irresponsibility the text should note
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
the high costs of climate pollution to
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens damages to New
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resources and property and
 
04:25:50.590 --> 04:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on health and
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
nature if you are tempted to vote out to
 
04:25:55.429 --> 04:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
pass in this resolution I request the
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
committee chairman invite our state
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
climatologist in for a Q&amp;A to clear up
 
04:26:03.070 --> 04:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
this committee's confusion about agw
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
that you ask the science technology and
 
04:26:07.070 --> 04:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
energy committee members on this bill if
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
they can cite major reports from
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
scientific organizations rather than
 
04:26:13.630 --> 04:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
Media or front group's talking points in
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
support of the claims made in the
 
04:26:19.790 --> 04:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
resolution why name climate alarmists
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
rather than note that 30% of New
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens are alarmed like I am
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
about climate change from fossil fuel
 
04:26:31.389 --> 04:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
pollution please consider my amended
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
proposal to this resolution to align
 
04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
this hcr1 with what we know through
 
04:26:39.109 --> 04:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
science and with the overwhelming public
 
04:26:41.750 --> 04:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
sentiment about this very flawed Bill
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
and from where information about the
 
04:26:44.910 --> 04:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
two- faced game some leaders in our
 
04:26:47.109 --> 04:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
state are being tricked by that result
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
in bills such as hcr1 please see not.org
 
04:26:54.830 --> 04:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I have two questions
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'll ask at the same time number one how
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
do you heat your house number two what
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
type of vehicle do you drive sure um so
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
can I take a meta view about these
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
questions first um carbon shaming is a
 
04:27:12.910 --> 04:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
tactic that these front groups liked us
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
to have in our discussion um it's a
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
personal attack that makes somebody go
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
on the defensive um but I'll answer the
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
question I'm not intending to put you on
 
04:27:25.109 --> 04:27:25.119 align:start position:0%
the defensive simple question of how do
 
04:27:26.710 --> 04:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
you heat your house what kind of vehicle
 
04:27:29.790 --> 04:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
do you drive just I'm answer that
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
now um I heat my house um my I had an
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
oil burning F furnace it was 40 years
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
old it started leaking in April it quit
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh I went for 6 months without a furnace
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
in my house and we started getting
 
04:27:46.030 --> 04:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
nervous that process I went to the New
 
04:27:48.269 --> 04:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves website to see what I
 
04:27:50.469 --> 04:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
could do about Energy Efficiency and I
 
04:27:52.710 --> 04:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
got great help from the state uh I
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
invested some of my own money I'm $9,000
 
04:27:57.910 --> 04:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
more energy efficient in my house mostly
 
04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
thanks to the state uh subsidy for that
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
um but it still wasn't enough uh for the
 
04:28:05.309 --> 04:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
available heat pump technology to heat
 
04:28:07.469 --> 04:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
my house they do have these Technologies
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
in Europe but because of rules in the US
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
we can't get them here I have forced hot
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
water with small radiators I need hot
 
04:28:17.590 --> 04:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
water to push through those radiators to
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
warm my house sufficiently so I was
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
forced to buy an oil burning furnace
 
04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
again much to my dismay um because not
 
04:28:27.550 --> 04:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm worried about my own climate
 
04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
footprint but because I resent having to
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
pay the fossil fuel industry for its
 
04:28:36.189 --> 04:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
products when I know that it has spent
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
decades dragging our
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
society's legislation from being able to
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
transition off of fossil fuels to clean
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
energy it's happening in other countries
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not because they're more
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
Innovative and smarter than we are the
 
04:28:52.830 --> 04:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry has its thumb on
 
04:28:56.469 --> 04:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
our legislation and delaying that my car
 
04:28:58.990 --> 04:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
died last year it's been an expensive
 
04:29:01.790 --> 04:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
couple years for the guge
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
household luckily electric vehicles in
 
04:29:07.389 --> 04:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
the US have progressed much faster than
 
04:29:09.910 --> 04:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
heating systems um heating systems are
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
great if you have an air system get a
 
04:29:13.590 --> 04:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
heat pump that's the way to go if you
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
have a forced hot water system wait two
 
04:29:18.670 --> 04:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
more years U Mitsubishi is coming out
 
04:29:21.189 --> 04:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
with a high temperature heat pump system
 
04:29:23.189 --> 04:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
and that was is probably going to be
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
great I was just two years too early my
 
04:29:28.349 --> 04:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle I bought it green wve
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
EV I test drove a whole bunch of
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
different kinds right in their parking
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
lot great place to go for cars um and I
 
04:29:38.990 --> 04:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
bought a used Kia ev6 it didn't it
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
didn't um get any of the federal funding
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
because it was made in Korea not in the
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
US but I saved $118,000 buying a used
 
04:29:50.189 --> 04:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle with low mileage and I
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely love it I drove it here uh I
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
came from Maine yesterday I plugged it
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
in last night when I got home it was
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
plenty charge to come here and go back
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh home after this meeting so individual
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
efforts you know do what you can you
 
04:30:06.670 --> 04:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
often save money and you do feel better
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
not giving your money to out ofate
 
04:30:11.229 --> 04:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
polluting companies but what we need is
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal and State legislation to address
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
the market failure and I passed out an
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
economist statement that explains why
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
nearly every Economist from across the
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum says a fully rebated
 
04:30:27.550 --> 04:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
border adjusted cash back carbon fee on
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels is our best first step to
 
04:30:32.590 --> 04:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this pollution problem
 
04:30:35.349 --> 04:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you have any further
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Belta saw
 
04:30:40.109 --> 04:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
you first thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:30:42.429 --> 04:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you were
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
very uh clear that you you believe we
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
should shift away from the polluting
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
industries of fossil fuels I don't think
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
I heard you say exactly what you would
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
if you were in our position what you
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
would see us replace those energy
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
sources with so could you just elaborate
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
on specifically what you would bring in
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
instead of those yeah sure efficient
 
04:31:04.119 --> 04:31:05.389 align:start position:0%
instead of those yeah sure efficient
market

04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:31:09.630 --> 04:31:09.640 align:start position:0%
forces um there's a economists climate
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
and policy modeling tool from MIT
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
called nroads n-
 
04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
roads.org is the website you can run it
 
04:31:24.149 --> 04:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
from it's got policy sliders that show
 
04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
if applied globally what policies will
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
do for Global Sources of primary energy
 
04:31:31.349 --> 04:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
the resulting greenhouse gas emissions
 
04:31:33.229 --> 04:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
over this century and the resulting
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
temperature based on ipcc
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
modeling now you can try your government
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
inter you know there's different ways
 
04:31:44.830 --> 04:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's regulations subsidies and
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
there's putting a price on pollution um
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
The Economist statement is clear the
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
most cost effective and Equitable way to
 
04:31:53.950 --> 04:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
reduce climate pollution is through a
 
04:31:55.950 --> 04:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
carbon price where the money is rebated
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
back to households this sends a
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
pollution price signal through the whole
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
economy so investors producers and
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
consumers are all motivated to pollute
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
less investment in Innovation happens we
 
04:32:12.469 --> 04:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
get better heat pumps better EV
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
we get fewer long-term investments in
 
04:32:18.910 --> 04:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
gas pipelines and more offshore wind um
 
04:32:21.309 --> 04:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
other countries are doing this Canada is
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
using carbon fee in dividend the EU is
 
04:32:25.870 --> 04:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
using a cap in trade but their carbon
 
04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
price is quite high and growing now the
 
04:32:31.309 --> 04:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
third part of the magical Economist
 
04:32:33.149 --> 04:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
solution is the Border adjustment and
 
04:32:35.550 --> 04:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's what the EU is about to do to us
 
04:32:37.950 --> 04:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
starting next year and this is when your
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
carbon price gets high enough you charge
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
your carbon price at the border for the
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
embedded emissions from free polluting
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
countries a carbon import tariff we're
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to start paying that to the EU
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
next year because there's a us a growing
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
us carbon price Gap so should we pick
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
EVS or hydrogen cars or windmills or
 
04:33:03.389 --> 04:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
nuclear you don't need to make that
 
04:33:05.551 --> 04:33:05.561 align:start position:0%
decision if you have an efficient energy
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
Market where the costs the true costs of
 
04:33:11.551 --> 04:33:11.561 align:start position:0%
the you of the production and the use of
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the goods are reflected in the price of
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
the goods this is just a market-based
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
revenue neutral way to reduce pollution
 
04:33:20.670 --> 04:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have to know what the right
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
Solutions are if you set up the rules in
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
the economy so that producers and
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
consumers are doing the best thing both
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
for themselves and uh for us as a whole
 
04:33:33.429 --> 04:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
representative Manion thank you Mr chair
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so you're
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
mentioning about the the child uh
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
anxiety with the climate change and like
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
even as I was growing up we were told uh
 
04:33:47.150 --> 04:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
the world's going to end in 10 years and
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
like as we've seen as even as I've grown
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
up over 10 years how do you address like
 
04:33:53.551 --> 04:33:53.561 align:start position:0%
the the failed predictions decade after
 
04:33:55.109 --> 04:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
decade that the ocean levels are going
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
to rise that we're going to run away
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse and become Venus that uh the
 
04:34:00.830 --> 04:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
Midwest is going to become a dust bowl
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
how how do you uh reconcile that with
 
04:34:04.109 --> 04:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
the reality thank you that's a great
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
question and it lets me talk about the
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
difference between the media and the
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
science if you've heard the world's
 
04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
going to end in 10 years think about
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
where that message came from who's
 
04:34:21.070 --> 04:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
telling you that somebody said that and
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
why the ipcc report from which the media
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
picked up that message said we have 10
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
more years at the current rate of
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
emissions to reach the point where the
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
world will warm up to one and a half deg
 
04:34:39.629 --> 04:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
that's what the science said now the
 
04:34:41.990 --> 04:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
media took it in lots of different ways
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
but don't get your science from your
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
media go to the report and read it it
 
04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
came from the special report of global
 
04:34:51.670 --> 04:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
warming on one and a half degrees
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's a graph in there I teach climate
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
I teach a class called Help solve
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
climate change to MIT at MIT to high
 
04:35:00.670 --> 04:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
school students and one of the graphs I
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
show is the is from that report
 
04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
showing there's a carbon budget
 
04:35:09.429 --> 04:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
remaining to hold warming to 1.5 the
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
longer we take to start reducing
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
in the next 10 years the
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
more vertical the the drop has to be for
 
04:35:21.629 --> 04:35:21.639 align:start position:0%
us to not go over that carbon budget the
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
world is not going to end at
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
1.5° what that report says is that every
 
04:35:30.510 --> 04:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
0.1 degre Celsius of warming is more
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
damage and it it looks at the difference
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
in global effect of 1.5° and 2° and that
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
so this is where we start to get
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
personal because I feel climate anxiety
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
because I've read the
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
science um I left my job six years ago
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
to volunteer fulltime to try to help
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
create the political will to get bipar
 
04:35:55.551 --> 04:35:55.561 align:start position:0%
and policies passed at the federal level
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
to address a pollution problem that I
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
think is the biggest risk to my
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
daughter's future it's affecting the
 
04:36:04.750 --> 04:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
nature that I love I love to Nordic ski
 
04:36:06.869 --> 04:36:06.879 align:start position:0%
but now I have to drive maybe we have
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
enough snow for the conquered ski the be
 
04:36:12.910 --> 04:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
race this weekend maybe not uh 30 years
 
04:36:14.551 --> 04:36:14.561 align:start position:0%
ago we certainly
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
did our climate is moving northward 50
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
ft a
 
04:36:22.269 --> 04:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
day um every day I wake up if I go
 
04:36:25.709 --> 04:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
outside I Feel Love of Nature and I feel
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
sadness for what we're
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
losing so the the front groups and the
 
04:36:33.910 --> 04:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
media that twists the story around from
 
04:36:37.310 --> 04:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel perspectives to delay us
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
addressing this critical pollution
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
problem is one of the things
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's bad that we're losing what we're
 
04:36:47.551 --> 04:36:47.561 align:start position:0%
losing but it's frustrating to me that
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
we're St still stymy decades after the
 
04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
industry that knew this was coming read
 
04:36:55.789 --> 04:36:55.799 align:start position:0%
that handout that I gave you Exxon knew
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
in the 70s that this was happening go to
 
04:37:02.590 --> 04:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
the two-faced game web page and you'll
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
see report after report videos from BP
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
and shell from decades ago warning about
 
04:37:11.150 --> 04:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
what their pollution was doing to our
 
04:37:11.160 --> 04:37:12.269 align:start position:0%
what their pollution was doing to our
future

04:37:12.269 --> 04:37:12.279 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:37:15.390 --> 04:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
and we are losing this now and the 1.5
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
Target is the best we could have done
 
04:37:20.629 --> 04:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
several years ago now James Hansen in
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
his newsletter says it's probably too
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
late maybe even too late for two degrees
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
they don't know
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
exactly there's airs in science but
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus in science is not a
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
political consensus of everybody just
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
coming to a
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
compromise it is a strong understanding
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
of what we know based on all the
 
04:37:43.310 --> 04:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
evidence and 's no reasonable
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
explanation other than the current
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
scientific understanding for this I'm
 
04:37:50.189 --> 04:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
still losing sleep over it at least now
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm able to spend all my time
 
04:37:53.310 --> 04:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
volunteering to help communicate the
 
04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
problem and solutions and work on
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
bipartisan approaches a carbon fee and
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
dividend is a market-based revenue
 
04:38:02.269 --> 04:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
neutral approach that will use Mar
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
efficient market forces to reduce
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
pollution in a way that protects
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
household budgets makes us businesses
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
more competitive in the global
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and holds heavy polluting
 
04:38:13.390 --> 04:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
countries accountable for their
 
04:38:15.029 --> 04:38:15.039 align:start position:0%
pollution and motivates them to price
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
carbon too thank you thank you forther
 
04:38:20.670 --> 04:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
questions one follow up thank you uh
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
just for the follow-up I just want to
 
04:38:24.029 --> 04:38:24.039 align:start position:0%
clarify so you were saying
 
04:38:26.670 --> 04:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
um that the media may be exaggerating
 
04:38:28.709 --> 04:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
the the results of these reports do you
 
04:38:31.029 --> 04:38:31.039 align:start position:0%
ever count try to fight back against the
 
04:38:33.150 --> 04:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
media uh exaggerations and tell them
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
that they're wrong so that kids aren't
 
04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
killing themselves because they think
 
04:38:37.230 --> 04:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
the world's going to
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
end well the thing about the media is
 
04:38:41.949 --> 04:38:41.959 align:start position:0%
it's funded by billions
 
04:38:44.709 --> 04:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
right uh I have a voice but I don't have
 
04:38:48.029 --> 04:38:48.039 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars and so it's not a fair
 
04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
fight uh you have a lot of people
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
volunteering their
 
04:38:56.310 --> 04:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
time protesting coal plants doing person
 
04:38:58.269 --> 04:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
putting themselves at risk you have
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
federal and state laws coming in to make
 
04:39:06.189 --> 04:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
those protests um have heavier penalties
 
04:39:08.629 --> 04:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
because the polluting industry has more
 
04:39:12.310 --> 04:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
power than the people um I don't have
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
any control over the media that people
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
intake I don't have control over how our
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
education system works um what I wish
 
04:39:22.990 --> 04:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
was Public Funding for Education went to
 
04:39:25.109 --> 04:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
public education that was held
 
04:39:27.510 --> 04:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
accountable uh for the education that is
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
being provided um we have all kinds of
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
problems through this state that are
 
04:39:36.029 --> 04:39:36.039 align:start position:0%
directed from the Cook network Charles
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Koch wants to get rid of public
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
education he wants to get rid of the EPA
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
he wants to get rid of a whole bunch of
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
things that we have put in place to
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
educate ourselves to protect ourselves
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
against billionaires who can manipulate
 
04:39:50.910 --> 04:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
media and get a whole bunch of people to
 
04:39:52.550 --> 04:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
follow along because that's what they
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
get from all the different angles okay
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Gage Mr Gage I think you have gone
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
around the mountain long enough here
 
04:40:03.150 --> 04:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
you've said repeated repeated we've
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.750 --> 04:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
one so I don't think I won't accept any
 
04:40:12.030 --> 04:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
more questions
 
04:40:13.390 --> 04:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate all the time you
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
gave me T we did give you quite a bit of
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
time you did thank you very much thank
 
04:40:18.160 --> 04:40:25.350 align:start position:0%
time you did thank you very much thank
you

04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee next up uh representative
 
04:40:28.440 --> 04:40:30.590 align:start position:0%
committee next up uh representative
Julius

04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
Julius
 
04:40:33.350 --> 04:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
sodi you've asked for you've asked for
 
04:40:36.510 --> 04:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
three to five minutes
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee members my name
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
is uh Julius soti I represent wiam and
 
04:40:58.430 --> 04:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
London I am here to uh um in support the
 
04:40:58.440 --> 04:41:00.030 align:start position:0%
London I am here to uh um in support the
bill

04:41:00.030 --> 04:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:41:02.270 --> 04:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
um could you bring the mic closer to
 
04:41:04.590 --> 04:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
your M sorry thank you yeah I I support
 
04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
04:41:10.110 --> 04:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
um the state of science is in a
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
crisis uh um I come at this from a
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
position of well my degree is in
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
philosophy and particularly the
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
philosophy of science theory of
 
04:41:22.110 --> 04:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge and
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
logic all this is is missing from
 
04:41:27.230 --> 04:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
today's scientific
 
04:41:29.708 --> 04:41:29.718 align:start position:0%
process it's become sloppy science
 
04:41:31.948 --> 04:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
motivated by
 
04:41:35.070 --> 04:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
funding the global warming people want
 
04:41:37.150 --> 04:41:37.160 align:start position:0%
to shut down the science process and
 
04:41:39.070 --> 04:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
replace it with
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
consensus Einstein
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
there was there was consensus against
 
04:41:47.390 --> 04:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
him too 100 scientists well it's garbage
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
and he says you can have a million
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
scientists like have consensus against
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
me just one has to prove me
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
wrong anthropogenic global warming fa
 
04:42:00.030 --> 04:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
fails the philosophy of science
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
test they have no coherent Theory or
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
hypoth hypothesis that makes
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
reproducible predictions in science if
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
make the
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
prediction you're
 
04:42:21.230 --> 04:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
wrong they have no mathematical no
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
definitive mathematical
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
calculations that can correctly account
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
for all the variables what they have is
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
guess work on top of guess work when you
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
look at how they arrive with some of
 
04:42:32.638 --> 04:42:34.190 align:start position:0%
look at how they arrive with some of
their

04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:42:37.948 --> 04:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
numbers their assumptions and guesswork
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
and they Ram it into climate models
 
04:42:43.030 --> 04:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
would would you would you cross a bridge
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
that was built that way on
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
guesswork a true working Theory
 
04:42:51.230 --> 04:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
should uh work throughout the solar
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
system and the Universe on all rocky
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
planets and moons with
 
04:43:01.310 --> 04:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
atmospheres actually such a theory does
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
exist a real working Theory the ideal
 
04:43:07.230 --> 04:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
gas law and there are a couple
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
scientists Ned ncov and uh Carl Zeller
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
who mathematically worked it out
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
predicting the
 
04:43:20.590 --> 04:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
temperatures of the rocky planets
 
04:43:23.310 --> 04:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the throughout our solar
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
system Venus which has been the analog
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
for the climate
 
04:43:29.400 --> 04:43:31.510 align:start position:0%
for the climate
change

04:43:31.510 --> 04:43:31.520 align:start position:0%

04:43:31.520 --> 04:43:33.590 align:start position:0%

fearmongers

04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
fearmongers
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh there's an exact example of what's
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
going on here the important part is
 
04:43:42.190 --> 04:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
atmospheric density and
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
hot and despite and Mars which also is
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
over 90% carbon
 
04:43:58.910 --> 04:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
dioxide is cold but the atmospheric
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
pressure is very low and it's cold if
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
you go on Venus is a perfect example
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
from down at the surface Extreme Hot
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
pressure and as you move
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
up the prediction works perfectly when
 
04:44:19.230 --> 04:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
you reach the air pressure that's on
 
04:44:21.310 --> 04:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
about 50 kmet up in their
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
atmosphere the air pressure is is the
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
same as Earth and so is the temperature
 
04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
dioxide so the work so that's the
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
working Theory and this is suppressed by
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
side other junk SCI that's been seen in
 
04:44:44.550 --> 04:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
the media
 
04:44:47.628 --> 04:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
Mythbusters they had a sealed chamber
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
test with ice in it and then they had a
 
04:44:54.150 --> 04:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
heat source and they one was the control
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
the other one was them pumping in carbon
 
04:45:00.750 --> 04:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
dioxide and they got about a after a
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
couple hours they got about a degree
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
difference but they didn't tell you that
 
04:45:07.470 --> 04:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
they pumped it up to about 70,000 parts
 
04:45:07.480 --> 04:45:08.230 align:start position:0%
they pumped it up to about 70,000 parts
per

04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
per
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
million versus the 400 parts that we had
 
04:45:13.470 --> 04:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
on the planet now and they also didn't
 
04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
account for the
 
04:45:17.190 --> 04:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
pressure so that's tell that's telling
 
04:45:23.110 --> 04:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
science uh I'll finish up with a quote
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
of what's going on here from uh the
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
President Eisenhower's address when he
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
uh left office he warned about the
 
04:45:38.830 --> 04:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
military industrial complex but he also
 
04:45:41.470 --> 04:45:41.480 align:start position:0%
warned about the scientific ific
 
04:45:41.480 --> 04:45:44.350 align:start position:0%
warned about the scientific ific
technological

04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%

04:45:47.390 --> 04:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
Elite the prospect of domination of a
 
04:45:47.400 --> 04:45:48.590 align:start position:0%
Elite the prospect of domination of a
nation's

04:45:48.590 --> 04:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
nation's
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
Scholars by federal employment project
 
04:45:55.590 --> 04:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
allocation and the power of money is
 
04:45:58.350 --> 04:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
ever present and is Gravely to be
 
04:46:01.110 --> 04:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
regarded yet in holding scientific
 
04:46:04.590 --> 04:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
discovery in respect as we should we
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
must also be alert to the equal and
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
opposite danger that public policy
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
could itself become a captive of a
 
04:46:13.520 --> 04:46:14.990 align:start position:0%
could itself become a captive of a
scientific

04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.070 --> 04:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
familiar so
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
ultimately the ultimate Corruption of
 
04:46:27.510 --> 04:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
science would be the codification of
 
04:46:30.590 --> 04:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide into our tax system once
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
it becomes a revenue
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
stream game over science is dead you'll
 
04:46:39.270 --> 04:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
never find out the truth I'll take
 
04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for that uh
 
04:46:41.200 --> 04:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for that uh

gagy thank you Mr Vice chairman thank
 
04:46:48.750 --> 04:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
you uh representative sodi for taking my
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
question um would you say my opinion I
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's going to be your
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
opinion that climate change is a reality
 
04:46:58.878 --> 04:46:59.670 align:start position:0%
opinion that climate change is a reality
and

04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:02.910 --> 04:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
cyclical yes I I would it's a what's
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
happening now is not out of the ordinary
 
04:47:09.110 --> 04:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
there's always been there's been the
 
04:47:12.070 --> 04:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
medieval warm period and there's the ice
 
04:47:15.868 --> 04:47:15.878 align:start position:0%
the mini ice age that we had bankovich
 
04:47:17.948 --> 04:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
cycle so forth there's nothing here
 
04:47:20.670 --> 04:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
that's out of the ordinary and then you
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
cannot tease
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
out 100 particles of carbon dioxide and
 
04:47:28.110 --> 04:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
say that's why we have climate change
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
it's an absurdity the real numbers are
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
predicted by the ideal gas law
 
04:47:36.548 --> 04:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the solar system follow up
 
04:47:36.558 --> 04:47:38.948 align:start position:0%
throughout the solar system follow up
thank

04:47:38.948 --> 04:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:42.390 --> 04:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm not a scientists I've got
 
04:47:44.948 --> 04:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
about 30 college credits I was raised on
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
the main streets of
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester so the these are simple
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
questions because I'm a simple
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
man but I do read and if I'm not
 
04:47:57.788 --> 04:47:57.798 align:start position:0%
mistaken and maybe someone here who's a
 
04:48:00.510 --> 04:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
history expert would say that in the
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
1600s I believe that Europe had no
 
04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
summer because it was cold you can't
 
04:48:08.350 --> 04:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
blame that on anthrop
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
anthropo human messing up yeah and would
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
you also believe followup sir follow up
 
04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you would you also believe that if
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
I remember right some time ago decades
 
04:48:25.150 --> 04:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
several decades ago that there was core
 
04:48:29.470 --> 04:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
samples taken from about a th000 foot uh
 
04:48:32.830 --> 04:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh core sample that had uh tropical
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
vegetation in it from Antarctica oh
 
04:48:39.990 --> 04:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely there's been and well carbon
 
04:48:42.070 --> 04:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
dioxide historically has never been a
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
climate driver it's always been a
 
04:48:43.878 --> 04:48:45.590 align:start position:0%
climate driver it's always been a
climate

04:48:45.590 --> 04:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
climate
 
04:48:49.708 --> 04:48:49.718 align:start position:0%
lagger it's been a 4,000 9,000 parts per
 
04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
million the the the climate driver is
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
atmospheric pressure and density case
 
04:49:01.350 --> 04:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
closed and and of course the solar
 
04:49:03.470 --> 04:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
input further
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
questions go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:09.350 --> 04:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr representative so we know
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
that fossil fuel price prices are tied
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
directly to Energy prices because we
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
don't you know on the macro are not able
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
right now to produce renewable energy
 
04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
without fossil fuel so we know that to
 
04:49:23.708 --> 04:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:27.470 --> 04:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
fact yeah so okay and we also know that
 
04:49:29.070 --> 04:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
in this part of the country we get less
 
04:49:30.788 --> 04:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
than 6 hours of daylight for several
 
04:49:32.430 --> 04:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
months a year and we also know that the
 
04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
majority of our population is heated by
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
either electric natural I mean I'm sorry
 
04:49:40.150 --> 04:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes electric natural gas oil or even
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
wood pellet now which also create carbon
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
right um I'm holding a piece that says
 
04:49:48.990 --> 04:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
that we should increase the carbon
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
tax continually until we hit a certain
 
04:49:53.548 --> 04:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
point in time we're also in the fourth
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
most expensive place in the United
 
04:49:56.430 --> 04:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
States to live in the middle of a
 
04:49:58.750 --> 04:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
housing crisis what is your prediction
 
04:49:59.948 --> 04:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
as to what would happen to the New
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy and people if we
 
04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
exercised these uh and implemented these
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
things without putting up guard rails to
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire people will freeze
 
04:50:11.070 --> 04:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
and die
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
questions would just like to ask a
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
question does um do you think that we
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
are currently over
 
04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
legislating um in any way um anything
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
that you know I'd say climate alarmist
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
would find favorable I mean I guess
 
04:50:30.628 --> 04:50:30.638 align:start position:0%
that's what a lot of this is about is
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
trying to rein in that side of that do
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
you think that that is currently
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
happening in any way shape or form do I
 
04:50:39.590 --> 04:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
think what they were over legislating on
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
the climate well if if we if we codify
 
04:50:46.350 --> 04:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
this into our tax system um you just
 
04:50:48.788 --> 04:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
created a revenue stream yeah that's
 
04:50:48.798 --> 04:50:50.230 align:start position:0%
created a revenue stream yeah that's
over

04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:50:52.110 --> 04:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
legislating it's creating a bad
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
incentive you're going to be um why why
 
04:50:57.390 --> 04:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
would people want to undo that if that's
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
their revenue
 
04:51:03.150 --> 04:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
stream that follow up yeah follow up I'm
 
04:51:05.230 --> 04:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering I mean obviously
 
04:51:06.548 --> 04:51:06.558 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
04:51:11.910 --> 04:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
not I guess um a part of my question is
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
do you think you know it was brought up
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we are currently you know jumping
 
04:51:19.948 --> 04:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
to legislation that we shouldn't be
 
04:51:23.230 --> 04:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
doing but you know do you agree with
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
that I mean
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
obviously we haven't put that much in
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
place with that said you know well one
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
of the things about this bill is it says
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
all s side should be heard and that's
 
04:51:37.548 --> 04:51:37.558 align:start position:0%
the way the science process is supposed
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
to work that's fine and I think that
 
04:51:44.030 --> 04:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
we're fine at that at that
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
position I don't think we need to do any
 
04:51:47.310 --> 04:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:54.070 --> 04:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
Le forther question oh follow up go
 
04:51:57.628 --> 04:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
ahead follow I guess um so from your
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
from your response though I mean do you
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
even see this as being needed I mean it
 
04:52:04.310 --> 04:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here right now and we are
 
04:52:06.910 --> 04:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
listening to both sides well if we're if
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're fearmongering our everybody um
 
04:52:12.230 --> 04:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should stop Fear mongering
 
04:52:15.110 --> 04:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
everybody because well everybody knows
 
04:52:15.120 --> 04:52:15.910 align:start position:0%
everybody because well everybody knows
fear

04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
fear
 
04:52:19.150 --> 04:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
sells uh and fear builds upon
 
04:52:23.548 --> 04:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
itself um perhaps so we could like tap
 
04:52:23.558 --> 04:52:26.910 align:start position:0%
itself um perhaps so we could like tap
that

04:52:26.910 --> 04:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
down representative MCH thank you Mr
 
04:52:30.910 --> 04:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here for
 
04:52:32.310 --> 04:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony I just actually wanted to
 
04:52:33.788 --> 04:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
follow up on that same line of thought
 
04:52:38.070 --> 04:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
which is what presently exists that
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
would necessitate this bill so I I want
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
to ask you because you seem to be aware
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
of a lot of the these kind of things
 
04:52:44.750 --> 04:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
that are going
 
04:52:47.310 --> 04:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
on outside of private ownership which is
 
04:52:49.628 --> 04:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
a whole different story are you aware of
 
04:52:53.110 --> 04:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
any large scale um development of solar
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
or wind that is not subsidized with
 
04:52:55.840 --> 04:52:58.390 align:start position:0%
or wind that is not subsidized with
taxpayer

04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.350 --> 04:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
money uh no I don't
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh well actually every probably most of
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
it is all uh subsidized by the
 
04:53:09.350 --> 04:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
government in one way or shape or
 
04:53:09.360 --> 04:53:12.788 align:start position:0%
government in one way or shape or
another

04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.030 --> 04:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
thank you further question yes Benn
 
04:53:16.040 --> 04:53:20.470 align:start position:0%
thank you further question yes Benn
representative

04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
Bennett sorry I
 
04:53:27.310 --> 04:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
gu and thank you for taking my question
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
um to follow up on representative bel's
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
Point are you aware that over time that
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
the oil industry the fossil fuel
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
industry has been hugely subsidized by
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
our tax tax dollars oh I don't agree
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
with subsidizing them either thank
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:54.190 --> 04:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
Bennett I had several questions but um I
 
04:53:56.190 --> 04:53:56.200 align:start position:0%
one question I was going to ask is why
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
are you supporting this bill in
 
04:54:01.150 --> 04:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
succinctly I think you kind of answered
 
04:54:04.270 --> 04:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
that but I wanted you to reiterate your
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
answer because science is a process not
 
04:54:07.440 --> 04:54:08.990 align:start position:0%
answer because science is a process not
a

04:54:08.990 --> 04:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:54:11.430 --> 04:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
consensus you either you're either right
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
and you're making predictions correctly
 
04:54:15.390 --> 04:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
or you're wrong you need to get the back
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
to the drawing board that's what science
 
04:54:22.030 --> 04:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
is followup followup I just wanted to
 
04:54:25.030 --> 04:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
say that what we've done here proves to
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
me that we do need this because we see
 
04:54:31.430 --> 04:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
that there are two sides and we do need
 
04:54:37.470 --> 04:54:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Bachi
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for uh taking my question
 
04:54:46.110 --> 04:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
well we've been hearing a lot of you
 
04:54:47.470 --> 04:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
know things like we need to hear from
 
04:54:51.070 --> 04:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
both sides so one side is obviously
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
scientific side what is the other side
 
04:54:55.510 --> 04:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
specifically could you specify those
 
04:54:59.030 --> 04:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
other sides well you mean scientists
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
there are scientists here and then there
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
are scientists that are being
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
suppressed that's the other side so
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
follow up Sir follow up so when
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's scientist I would I I would
 
04:55:15.868 --> 04:55:15.878 align:start position:0%
take them together scientific side or
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
group and I'm trying to find out the
 
04:55:23.070 --> 04:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
other side maybe uh uh someone who uh
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
deny uh you know climate change or
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
someone else nobody denies climate
 
04:55:32.830 --> 04:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
change climate change is that's
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
normal the rate right now the debate is
 
04:55:39.788 --> 04:55:39.798 align:start position:0%
what the rate that is changing is this
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
few hundred
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
molecules of carbon dioxide making a
 
04:55:46.510 --> 04:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
difference or not to tease that out is
 
04:55:50.590 --> 04:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
impossibility oh it really it is when
 
04:55:56.750 --> 04:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
when when you how you're getting
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
measurements from temperatures from all
 
04:56:01.310 --> 04:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
over the country and the rest of the
 
04:56:02.390 --> 04:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
world but the rest of the world doesn't
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
have nearly the amount of of data it's
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's bunch of
 
04:56:09.750 --> 04:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
guesswork and and assumptions that's
 
04:56:11.430 --> 04:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's what they into the climate
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
models if you you cannot predict
 
04:56:18.510 --> 04:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
anything on a basic basis of all this
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
guess work a
 
04:56:25.350 --> 04:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
followup you have a followup um just
 
04:56:28.628 --> 04:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
brief what's your background are you
 
04:56:30.430 --> 04:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
have you I studied philosophy philosophy
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
of science logic and the theory of
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge theory of knowledge deals with
 
04:56:38.230 --> 04:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
how do you know that you know and I am
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
imminently qualified to examine the
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
you represent gagy as a final question
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
there a final question thank you Mr
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
chairman in your
 
04:56:58.110 --> 04:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
opinion this bill would this
 
04:57:01.868 --> 04:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
house concurrent resolution would help
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
get both sides together in a neutral
 
04:57:07.590 --> 04:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
setting so they could hash it out
 
04:57:09.510 --> 04:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
amongst themselves and come up with some
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
good um resolution that would be
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
amendable to all to whether clim the the
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
the heating up of the planet is is is
 
04:57:22.350 --> 04:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
detrimental or bad or is it cyclical or
 
04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
just a normal event but they would come
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
to a conclusion both sides I would hope
 
04:57:30.510 --> 04:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
spot on if everybody's listened to I
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
would hope that would be the result
 
04:57:35.830 --> 04:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
04:57:37.510 --> 04:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
questions go
 
04:57:40.868 --> 04:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm curious uh we had two bills
 
04:57:42.030 --> 04:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
before us
 
04:57:44.868 --> 04:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh for study committees one on
 
04:57:47.470 --> 04:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
the uh effect of the carbon based and
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
another one on the economic impact of
 
04:57:54.750 --> 04:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:57.270 --> 04:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
failed we were trying to get the
 
04:57:59.948 --> 04:57:59.958 align:start position:0%
information and get the studies and I'm
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
curious as to how you voted and why if
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
you feel comfortable doing so I know you
 
04:58:07.788 --> 04:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
don't have but why if you don't feel so
 
04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
then why do you think so many people
 
04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
well it's perhaps a a step too far and
 
04:58:19.470 --> 04:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
the way the thing was worded was that we
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
definitely know there's a problem and we
 
04:58:23.548 --> 04:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to do something and
 
04:58:26.910 --> 04:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to light it all up
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
and this bill is more reasonable it
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
says let's talk about it figure it out
 
04:58:37.150 --> 04:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
hash out the numbers look at what's
 
04:58:38.670 --> 04:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
actually predictable what's not
 
04:58:38.680 --> 04:58:40.230 align:start position:0%
actually predictable what's not
predictable

04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
predictable
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
and there are range there's a range
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a range of certainty
 
04:58:46.830 --> 04:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
to science the more variables you put
 
04:58:50.628 --> 04:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
in the more chaos you have and the more
 
04:58:53.310 --> 04:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
unpredictable your
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
results and and climate science is more
 
04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
analogous to
 
04:59:02.350 --> 04:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
economics if if e if economists could
 
04:59:06.190 --> 04:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
predict things they'd all be rich yeah
 
04:59:08.070 --> 04:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's there's too much noise too
 
04:59:10.230 --> 04:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
much chaos going on for them to be able
 
04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
do that they could talk they could do
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
it's a more of a descriptive science
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
than a predictive science and the
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
mathematical calculation that I talked
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
about the ideal gas law that is a
 
04:59:24.628 --> 04:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
descriptive way to understand the
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
planets and their
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
temperatures but what they're going what
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
they're what they're trying to do is the
 
04:59:32.830 --> 04:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
climate alarm is s like wa well we're we
 
04:59:35.070 --> 04:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
know we're going to be on fire I don't
 
04:59:38.190 --> 04:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
think so thank you any further questions
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:59:42.548 --> 04:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
testim ony now going to call on Dr
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
Daniel hman he is opposed to the bill
 
04:59:49.868 --> 04:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you um for taking my
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
testimony good afternoon excuse me I'm a
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
retired um physician um with a specialty
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
in um
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry um I want to talk about my
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
impression of this bill which is that
 
05:00:10.670 --> 05:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's a bill with false equivalence
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
climate science is an ongoing scientific
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
process with researchers working
 
05:00:18.430 --> 05:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
worldwide scientists obtained their
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
positions after years of studies of
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
subjects such as math statistics
 
05:00:26.350 --> 05:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
chemistry physics oceanography biology
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
atmospheric science geology and computer
 
05:00:31.470 --> 05:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
modeling I looked up the requirements
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
for climate science it is published in
 
05:00:36.548 --> 05:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed journals with data
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
collected from satellites groundbased
 
05:00:41.708 --> 05:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
measurements and GE ologic records the
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
analysis and conclusions are o openly
 
05:00:47.390 --> 05:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
available and are open as is the
 
05:00:50.830 --> 05:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
scientific process to criticism
 
05:00:53.070 --> 05:00:53.080 align:start position:0%
reproducibility and ongoing
 
05:00:56.430 --> 05:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
modifications if the data warrants I'd
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
also like to add that in my career and
 
05:01:00.990 --> 05:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
in my life I've known many scientists of
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
all different stripes the vast majority
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
of them are dedicated people who are
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
underpaid relative to what their skills
 
05:01:12.070 --> 05:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
could command and in the private sector
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
and they're really dedicated to science
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
that's not to say they aren't bad actors
 
05:01:18.270 --> 05:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
and I've known some of them but the vast
 
05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
majority of of scientists are are true
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
and honest people that are doing their
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
best according to the American
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
Association for the advancement of of
 
05:01:31.548 --> 05:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
science there is a clear consensus that
 
05:01:33.350 --> 05:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
word has been bandied about and
 
05:01:36.670 --> 05:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
scientists do come up with consensus 90
 
05:01:38.548 --> 05:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
you've heard the term
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
97% it it varies depending on the sample
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
size some have gone as high as 100% but
 
05:01:47.548 --> 05:01:47.558 align:start position:0%
these are of published climate
 
05:01:49.868 --> 05:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
scientists and they're in agreement that
 
05:01:52.110 --> 05:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
humans are causing global warming and
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
climate change I should add if I
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
remember my college chemistry that Bo's
 
05:01:59.310 --> 05:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
law does has nothing to do with
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases and and how uh carbon
 
05:02:05.350 --> 05:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
dioxide absorbs radiation and radiates
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
it back um to the Earth the effects are
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
at present a 1.4 degree rise in
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
temperature over the last 100 years a
 
05:02:16.990 --> 05:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
rise in sea level heat waves and periods
 
05:02:20.070 --> 05:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
of heavy precipitation thousands of
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
people have died worldwide from climate
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
change Millions have had their lives
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
disrupted and the costs are in the
 
05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
billions environments are being
 
05:02:30.750 --> 05:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
permanently damaged and
 
05:02:33.070 --> 05:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
biodiversity which is a critical piece
 
05:02:35.470 --> 05:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
of this because the environment
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
interacts with the climate is being
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
disrupted and declining
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
we are at risk of pushing our climate
 
05:02:46.548 --> 05:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
toward abrupt unpredictable irreversible
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
damaging changes the sooner sooner we
 
05:02:52.430 --> 05:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
act we lower the risk and costs the
 
05:02:54.750 --> 05:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
problem with carbon dioxide is when it
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
accumulates it lasts for decades and
 
05:02:59.310 --> 05:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
centuries we can't just turn it's like
 
05:03:02.070 --> 05:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
turning a a cruise liner you turn the
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
knob down now it doesn't start to go for
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
a long time so that's the sense of
 
05:03:10.548 --> 05:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
urgency you know everyone's talking
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
about alarmism the problem is
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
not um alarmism so much as recognizing
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
the problem that if we don't cut it down
 
05:03:22.270 --> 05:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
now we're getting even further behind
 
05:03:22.280 --> 05:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
now we're getting even further behind
the

05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:26.830 --> 05:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
curve um we're we're the more we produce
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
we're passing risks down to our future
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
to Future Generations which is a
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
terrible Legacy but that's what keeps me
 
05:03:35.628 --> 05:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
up at night I'm
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
70 you know I'm G to make it through I'm
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
worried about my kids my grandkids
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
today um the other piece of this which
 
05:03:50.070 --> 05:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
seems to get lost is the adoption of
 
05:03:50.080 --> 05:03:51.230 align:start position:0%
seems to get lost is the adoption of
green

05:03:51.230 --> 05:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
green
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
energy um many e many including 28 Noel
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
winning economists feel that it will
 
05:04:01.270 --> 05:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
improve our economy our health and
 
05:04:03.868 --> 05:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
environment the only losers really are
 
05:04:07.230 --> 05:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuel industry and that's the
 
05:04:10.350 --> 05:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
reality the CL the problem with the
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
other side is it's not science the
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
spectrum of of opinion that was referred
 
05:04:19.670 --> 05:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
to in this bill is between science-based
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge and disinformation that's been
 
05:04:24.270 --> 05:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
published by oil billionaires and their
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies and that's the
 
05:04:26.680 --> 05:04:28.628 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel companies and that's the
false

05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
false
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
equivalence thank you thank you for your
 
05:04:34.350 --> 05:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
testimony do I have any
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative belgum thank
 
05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for being here
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
for your testimony I just wanted to
 
05:04:42.750 --> 05:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
nailed down one point I believe you said
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
that most of the scientists that you've
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
known um they are underpaid and they
 
05:04:50.830 --> 05:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
could make more they could command a
 
05:04:52.990 --> 05:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
higher salary in the public sector I
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to drill down are is it your
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that the majority of
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
scientists that you know then are
 
05:04:59.548 --> 05:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
dependent on Government funding for
 
05:04:59.558 --> 05:05:01.750 align:start position:0%
dependent on Government funding for
their

05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
income well if you talk about university
 
05:05:10.510 --> 05:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
positions or um funded positions yes
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know where all they're fund I
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
mean some of it comes from private uh
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
organizations there are a lot of
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
different revenue streams that uh I
 
05:05:21.070 --> 05:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
should say that I don't I I'm not sure
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
whether I would answer that with yes but
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of um funding does come from the
 
05:05:26.948 --> 05:05:26.958 align:start position:0%
government I'm
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure thank you other
 
05:05:30.160 --> 05:05:31.910 align:start position:0%
sure thank you other
questions

05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:05:35.830 --> 05:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
see sorry representative Bennett um I
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
guess I'm kind of curious as to the same
 
05:05:40.788 --> 05:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
kind of question like why are you
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
opposing this bill to me this bill looks
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
like we're going to talk about things
 
05:05:49.190 --> 05:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
and so why are you opposing it yeah
 
05:05:52.708 --> 05:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
that's a good question the it just seems
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
like it's more of the same it's a way to
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
keep up the The Fog of disinformation by
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
saying yes there are two sides to it
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
which is really there's a a science side
 
05:06:06.470 --> 05:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a non-science
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
side this is not a debate you know if
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
you have facts you have facts um if
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
those facts can be um drilled down we
 
05:06:19.470 --> 05:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
can look at it more closely but to talk
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
about it as though humans are not
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
producing climate change you know over
 
05:06:27.948 --> 05:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
the last I don't know 100 years but it's
 
05:06:31.590 --> 05:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
gone up 1.4 the amount of carbon dioxide
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the air has gone up from 200 Parts um
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
to 400 the last time we had this was 15
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
million years
 
05:06:45.628 --> 05:06:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.230 --> 05:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
higher thank you any further questions
 
05:06:51.150 --> 05:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank thank you for your
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate and now we're down to two
 
05:06:58.230 --> 05:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
tickets left I
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
got won
 
05:07:03.750 --> 05:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
Sinkler he is opposed to the
 
05:07:06.070 --> 05:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill he's asked for two
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chairman I'm
 
05:07:11.470 --> 05:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
Wharton Sinkler from uh Sandwich New
 
05:07:14.430 --> 05:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm opposed to the bill uh
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons one I want to
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
read the um the main resolution part
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
itself calling on policy makers locally
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
and nationally to fully consider all
 
05:07:28.150 --> 05:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
relevant information and factors
 
05:07:30.628 --> 05:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
pertaining to climate change before
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
pursuing courses of action that could
 
05:07:34.708 --> 05:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
adversely affect any economy or
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
environment to me this goes without
 
05:07:40.430 --> 05:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
saying so I'm kind of wonder ing why we
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
need a resolution in fact really any
 
05:07:47.548 --> 05:07:47.558 align:start position:0%
policy or legislation that that our
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
legislature considers should uh fully
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
consider all relevant information before
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh vote so to me it just seems silly to
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
do something that already is uh is is
 
05:08:04.430 --> 05:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
really goes without saying and should be
 
05:08:06.990 --> 05:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
understood um and and is not even
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
specific to climate change and then the
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
other part of the resolution involves a
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
lot of assertions in the uh whereas
 
05:08:18.230 --> 05:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
section and I'll read a couple of these
 
05:08:20.548 --> 05:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
whereas there is a documented pattern of
 
05:08:23.310 --> 05:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
suppression of some climate perspectives
 
05:08:23.320 --> 05:08:24.230 align:start position:0%
suppression of some climate perspectives
and

05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
data uh wrong many historically wrong
 
05:08:31.868 --> 05:08:31.878 align:start position:0%
climate predictions a long history of
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
climate alarmism and intimidation by
 
05:08:39.510 --> 05:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
special interests implying uh corruption
 
05:08:42.030 --> 05:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
essentially special interests putting
 
05:08:45.548 --> 05:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
pressure on science you know I think the
 
05:08:48.030 --> 05:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
question here is where is where is the
 
05:08:50.628 --> 05:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
border where is the boundary of these
 
05:08:53.470 --> 05:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
statements you know I mean we have we
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
have a a state
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
climatologist um Professor Mary stampone
 
05:09:02.548 --> 05:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
of uh UNH and you know she wrote a
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
climate assessment uh in 2021 or
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
co-authored it you know it makes an
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
assertion that uh based on measurements
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
of temperature the temperature has
 
05:09:16.628 --> 05:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
increased throughout the 20th century in
 
05:09:18.430 --> 05:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and has
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
accelerated since about
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
1970 uh right up to 2020 is that a is
 
05:09:28.830 --> 05:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
that a a statement that we should be
 
05:09:32.190 --> 05:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
suspicious of as corrupt
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
or uh or cherry-picking uh and
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
suppression of other opinions
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
or or another
 
05:09:44.030 --> 05:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
example you know if you go on the NASA
 
05:09:47.110 --> 05:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
website today it says Greenland ice
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
sheet is losing ice it's losing ice to
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the tune of two about 270 billion metric
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
tons a year that's a lot of ice okay and
 
05:10:00.590 --> 05:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
there are careful measurements being
 
05:10:05.070 --> 05:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
done to get get us that number is that
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
number now based on the these whereas
 
05:10:09.990 --> 05:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
statements it seems seems like that
 
05:10:13.470 --> 05:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
number should be doubted you know and my
 
05:10:17.070 --> 05:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
so my question is you know is is there
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
of course we've heard some crackpot
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
assertions made by you know climate
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
alarmists too right they're they're out
 
05:10:27.150 --> 05:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
there I have absolutely no uh doubt and
 
05:10:29.708 --> 05:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
no I don't dispute that at all but when
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
you paint with such a broad brush in
 
05:10:35.948 --> 05:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
these assertions you're really not doing
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
anybody a favor because you're not being
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
clear enough about what is what
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
represents good science and what doesn't
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have a very proud tradition in this
 
05:10:51.230 --> 05:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
country of scientific inquiry that has
 
05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
brought a huge progress going all the
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
way back to the founding fathers through
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
the the founding of the National Science
 
05:11:01.990 --> 05:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
Foundation by uh Abraham Lincoln
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
President Abraham Lincoln um these are
 
05:11:08.788 --> 05:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
proud things and we should be careful
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
not to throw out great science just
 
05:11:17.230 --> 05:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
because of a you know of a of kind of
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
poorly formulated assertions that are
 
05:11:21.788 --> 05:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
then voted on by the New Hampshire
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and approved why would you
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
approve these statements they need to be
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
elaborated on there's more there's more
 
05:11:31.830 --> 05:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
going on I'm a scientist I've worked in
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
science my whole life I actually worked
 
05:11:36.548 --> 05:11:36.558 align:start position:0%
in the private sector uh for the fossil
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
fuel industry okay and I know yeah and I
 
05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
know a lot of scientists and not all of
 
05:11:44.430 --> 05:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
them have integrity but I can also say
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that many many many of the people that I
 
05:11:49.670 --> 05:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
admire most in the world are scientists
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
and I admire them most of all because
 
05:11:56.190 --> 05:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
they the minute they sniff a
 
05:11:58.590 --> 05:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
problem in the in the data that
 
05:12:00.590 --> 05:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
something doesn't something do isn't
 
05:12:04.430 --> 05:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
right that they they will they will uh
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
distance themselves from that so fast
 
05:12:09.390 --> 05:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
it'll make your head spin that's
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
Integrity in science and it's it's out
 
05:12:13.788 --> 05:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
there it's real it's good we should
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
applaud it and yeah I I I think this uh
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
is a poorly worded resolution in my
 
05:12:23.070 --> 05:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
opinion it has makes assertions that
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
that are unfair and I hope you will uh
 
05:12:29.548 --> 05:12:29.558 align:start position:0%
judge it in expedient to legislate thank
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I thank you for
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony and we have one card left
 
05:12:43.590 --> 05:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
left it is George

pronunciation and am and I totally
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
apologize don't you worry about it it's

05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
pronounce I'm representing myself I'm a

German citizen retired in September 202
 
05:13:41.750 --> 05:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
three from my professorship in Germany
 
05:13:44.670 --> 05:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
and currently work at Dartmouth College
 
05:13:47.788 --> 05:13:47.798 align:start position:0%
I'm neutral on this proposal and as far
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
as its wording goes you are a lot more
 
05:13:53.470 --> 05:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
experienced than I will ever be on this
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
issue my experience is on environmental
 
05:13:59.548 --> 05:13:59.558 align:start position:0%
and climate science having served as a
 
05:14:03.150 --> 05:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
full professor and chair I volunteered
 
05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
as advisor on climate change related
 
05:14:07.708 --> 05:14:07.718 align:start position:0%
issues to the sexon government in
 
05:14:12.030 --> 05:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
Germany as of the year 2000 I co-chaired
 
05:14:14.628 --> 05:14:14.638 align:start position:0%
a biannual conference on Regional
 
05:14:18.350 --> 05:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
climate change targeting decision makers
 
05:14:21.070 --> 05:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders as an honest broker
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
translating science to a more generalist
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
audience as a longtime member of the
 
05:14:30.548 --> 05:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
German ipcc team in the working group
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
one for the physics of climate change
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
which works like a think tank I reviewed
 
05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
IP ipcc tasks and identified knowledge
 
05:14:44.350 --> 05:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
gaps I am concerned about human activity
 
05:14:47.070 --> 05:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
driven climate change because it poses
 
05:14:49.590 --> 05:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
significant and avoidable risks to
 
05:14:53.190 --> 05:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
societies including us in New England it
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
does not help to turn a blind eye to
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
this hoping that these risks move away
 
05:14:57.760 --> 05:14:58.708 align:start position:0%
this hoping that these risks move away
by

05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:15:02.310 --> 05:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
themselves however related challenges
 
05:15:05.070 --> 05:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
can be met by preparing for the known
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
and highly likely as well as by critical
 
05:15:10.750 --> 05:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
scrutiny of the evidence in all related
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
fields of
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
expertise I'm also concerned about
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
misperceptions in the public
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the issue which Drive
 
05:15:23.270 --> 05:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
irrational behavior and inappropriate
 
05:15:26.030 --> 05:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
reactions rather than supporting calm
 
05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and open
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
discussion the bill proposes to improve
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
the legislative process by considering
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
all relevant information pertaining to
 
05:15:38.990 --> 05:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
climate change let me provide an examp
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
example of relevant information that is
 
05:15:44.910 --> 05:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
often missing from current climate
 
05:15:47.628 --> 05:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
discussions the likely biggest
 
05:15:50.830 --> 05:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
misperception is that climate change
 
05:15:54.270 --> 05:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
questions planetary survival we need to
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
save the
 
05:15:59.310 --> 05:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
world that is uncalled for and of little
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
to no help instead we need to look at
 
05:16:05.788 --> 05:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities and possibilities that can
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
help us counter climate change to adapt
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
to irrevocable consequences as well as
 
05:16:15.390 --> 05:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
to benefit from local and Regional
 
05:16:18.670 --> 05:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
chances that automatically emerge from
 
05:16:18.680 --> 05:16:20.390 align:start position:0%
chances that automatically emerge from
climate

05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
climate
 
05:16:22.910 --> 05:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
Dynamics my personal experience with
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
climate information or alarmism includes
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
the following story as an academic
 
05:16:31.030 --> 05:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
teacher I'm in close contact with a
 
05:16:33.390 --> 05:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
young generation and perceive their
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
worries as responsible citizen with
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
expert background in climate change
 
05:16:41.230 --> 05:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
related matters I volunteered in serving
 
05:16:43.470 --> 05:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
a regional government as Regional
 
05:16:46.230 --> 05:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
government adviser in Germany and never
 
05:16:49.070 --> 05:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
turned down requests by public services
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
schools community colleges or
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
universities to discuss the topic with
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
lay people it is in this context that I
 
05:17:01.628 --> 05:17:01.638 align:start position:0%
quickly learn two things one that normal
 
05:17:05.030 --> 05:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
people like every one of us can neither
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
automatically understand the scientific
 
05:17:07.080 --> 05:17:09.670 align:start position:0%
automatically understand the scientific
jargon

05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
jargon
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
nor the displays of science graphics and
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
two that many people often feel helpless
 
05:17:18.310 --> 05:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
and intimidated by much of the public
 
05:17:21.708 --> 05:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
discussion in media and even public
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
hearings this Insight changed my way of
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
communication with lay people and led to
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
products such as a free booklet entitled
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
climate change climate Swindle targeting
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
a l
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
audience the a ancient Greek politician
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
and general Pericles said quote it is
 
05:17:48.190 --> 05:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
not about predicting the future but of
 
05:17:51.310 --> 05:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
being prepared for it it is this
 
05:17:53.990 --> 05:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
foresighted and constructive spirit that
 
05:17:57.708 --> 05:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
any society needs to face future the
 
05:17:59.670 --> 05:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
future and its challenges to
 
05:18:01.548 --> 05:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
successfully develop and open
 
05:18:04.270 --> 05:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities for future
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
Generations my personal bottom line is
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
very simple there is no reason to panic
 
05:18:13.270 --> 05:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
panicking never solves problems but
 
05:18:16.708 --> 05:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
usually leads to Agony or inappropriate
 
05:18:19.628 --> 05:18:19.638 align:start position:0%
reactions there is reason however to
 
05:18:22.310 --> 05:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
take precautions and to increase
 
05:18:22.320 --> 05:18:23.590 align:start position:0%
take precautions and to increase
societal

05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
societal
 
05:18:26.948 --> 05:18:26.958 align:start position:0%
resilience this can be done following no
 
05:18:30.030 --> 05:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
regret principles which means that
 
05:18:33.390 --> 05:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
measures taken neither waste resources
 
05:18:37.270 --> 05:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
nor do damage even if the future reality
 
05:18:40.670 --> 05:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
does not turn out EX exctly as projected
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much for the
 
05:18:45.350 --> 05:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to you this is a
 
05:18:47.230 --> 05:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
extreme honor and of course I'm
 
05:18:49.590 --> 05:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
available to questions thank you any
 
05:18:52.868 --> 05:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative hennyway thank
 
05:18:54.948 --> 05:18:54.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you Professor for
 
05:18:56.430 --> 05:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
coming and for your work that you're'
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
doing um so you talked about the future
 
05:19:02.350 --> 05:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
and the planning and how we go about
 
05:19:05.670 --> 05:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
making oursel more resilient uh what do
 
05:19:09.270 --> 05:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
you see our plan should be
 
05:19:13.830 --> 05:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do this do we go uh nuclear uh solar
 
05:19:16.750 --> 05:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh wind power do you have another
 
05:19:18.430 --> 05:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
another source of energy that you wouldd
 
05:19:21.030 --> 05:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
like to throw out we we could probably
 
05:19:24.750 --> 05:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
spend weeks now but let me use my New
 
05:19:24.760 --> 05:19:26.430 align:start position:0%
spend weeks now but let me use my New
Hampshire

05:19:26.430 --> 05:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:19:29.948 --> 05:19:29.958 align:start position:0%
experience uh I have seen the torrential
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
rains last
 
05:19:35.390 --> 05:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
summer I have seen drought last year no
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
not last summer second last summer
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me in vermond in New Hampshire in
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
particular extreme weather events are
 
05:19:47.430 --> 05:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
increasingly becoming likely to highly
 
05:19:49.110 --> 05:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
likely in our
 
05:19:52.990 --> 05:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
region they do damage that we know and
 
05:19:56.350 --> 05:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
partly can assess quick pretty precisely
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
so a precautionary principle means that
 
05:20:01.390 --> 05:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
we strengthen infrastructure wherever
 
05:20:04.910 --> 05:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's needed in order to avoid major
 
05:20:08.110 --> 05:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
hassle by destroyed Bridges and and and
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to energy Supply
 
05:20:14.590 --> 05:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
because you address that
 
05:20:17.548 --> 05:20:17.558 align:start position:0%
too I tell you a little story from Japan
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
because I have been working for quite a
 
05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
while in
 
05:20:24.070 --> 05:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
Japan Japan has a gigantic potential for
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
geothermal energy because it's active
 
05:20:28.350 --> 05:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
rich in active
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
volcanism yes they do have a few less
 
05:20:32.080 --> 05:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
volcanism yes they do have a few less
than

05:20:33.030 --> 05:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
20 very very efficient geothermal power
 
05:20:39.470 --> 05:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
plants which is a tiny fraction of the
 
05:20:43.230 --> 05:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
potential why do they not use it I can't
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
tell you the entire story but there is
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
certain interests against it and the
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
funniest thing is the onen industry onen
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
are hot bath that you submerge to to
 
05:20:56.910 --> 05:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
relax because you wash yourself
 
05:20:59.230 --> 05:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
beforehand and this is pretty important
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
industry because it's part of the
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
culture the funny thing is the truth or
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
the reality the physical reality behind
 
05:21:11.868 --> 05:21:11.878 align:start position:0%
it is that the abstraction of geothermal
 
05:21:13.990 --> 05:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
energy from these
 
05:21:17.470 --> 05:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
volcanoes does not do any damage to anen
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
activity because there's such a gigantic
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
surplus of energy and still the argument
 
05:21:27.070 --> 05:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
of the lobbyism for onance overpowers
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
the societal
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
discussion I think I answered your
 
05:21:31.000 --> 05:21:32.470 align:start position:0%
discussion I think I answered your
question

05:21:32.470 --> 05:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
indirectly thank you representative
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:21:42.270 --> 05:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
welman uh that's about the only German
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
word I know
 
05:21:48.110 --> 05:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
dun thank you very much
 
05:21:51.510 --> 05:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
it you were talking about Japan isn't
 
05:21:55.230 --> 05:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
that a similar uh scenario in Iceland
 
05:21:56.830 --> 05:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
where they're sitting on top of a
 
05:21:59.628 --> 05:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
Caldera pretty much you are right it is
 
05:22:02.030 --> 05:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
similar in respect to the geothermal
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
potential but unlike Japan the Icelandic
 
05:22:11.510 --> 05:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
05:22:15.788 --> 05:22:15.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bel thank you Mr chairman
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here for your
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
testimony I wanted to drill just a
 
05:22:21.230 --> 05:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
little bit into the statement you made
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the the severe rain and
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
weather events that we've had because
 
05:22:26.548 --> 05:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
certainly being you know representing
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
part of a mountainous region we had some
 
05:22:30.990 --> 05:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
serious flooding going on but I'm I'm
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
trying to wonder from your perspective
 
05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
as a as somebody who's has a background
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
in climate science and with and with
 
05:22:39.868 --> 05:22:39.878 align:start position:0%
these organizations how do we how can
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
you differentiate between something that
 
05:22:45.190 --> 05:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
was hum driven and that therefore we can
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
continue we can expect will continue in
 
05:22:50.150 --> 05:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
the long term versus and I don't know
 
05:22:51.788 --> 05:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
how widespread this knowledge is the
 
05:22:53.750 --> 05:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
hung a Tong of volcano eruption that
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
occurred underwater a couple years ago
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
that was such a massive volcanic
 
05:23:00.868 --> 05:23:00.878 align:start position:0%
eruption underwater that it increased
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
atmospheric water concentration by about
 
05:23:06.030 --> 05:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
10% immediately leading a lot of people
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to have a wet and hot
 
05:23:08.160 --> 05:23:09.070 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to have a wet and hot
de

05:23:09.070 --> 05:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
de
 
05:23:10.750 --> 05:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
so how do we differentiate between those
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
things this is a very good
 
05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
question and um that is something why we
 
05:23:20.190 --> 05:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
in climate science need numerical
 
05:23:20.200 --> 05:23:21.350 align:start position:0%
in climate science need numerical
Dynamic

05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
Dynamic
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
models now it would probably take me
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
quite a while to explain these models
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
and the thermodynamic and the fluid
 
05:23:32.990 --> 05:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
Dynamic functions behind it the idea is
 
05:23:37.150 --> 05:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
that you make a computer Dynamic
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
computer model that contains the
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
important processes that we know from
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
the planetary functioning including of
 
05:23:48.910 --> 05:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
course volcanism including the radiation
 
05:23:50.830 --> 05:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
balance from the Sun
 
05:23:53.150 --> 05:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
including anything we
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
can and then we run these computer
 
05:23:58.750 --> 05:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
models on very powerful machines in
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
order to have very many different runs
 
05:24:04.350 --> 05:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
parallel runs where we change the
 
05:24:07.548 --> 05:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
initial conditions and this allows us to
 
05:24:09.948 --> 05:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
mathematically differentiate what is
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
doing what is triggering what with what
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
kind of likeliness this is why you find
 
05:24:18.548 --> 05:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
and likeliness means statistics yeah
 
05:24:21.310 --> 05:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
extremely likely is something like 99%
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
certain statistically certain highly
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
likely is like 95% statistically certain
 
05:24:29.628 --> 05:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth and this way you
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the different
 
05:24:35.350 --> 05:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
let's say triggers of an effect and then
 
05:24:38.590 --> 05:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
you do go to these places usually with
 
05:24:40.548 --> 05:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
geophysical instruments or whatever you
 
05:24:44.548 --> 05:24:44.558 align:start position:0%
have and try to verify or falsify this
 
05:24:47.230 --> 05:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
computer output and this is how it works
 
05:24:49.948 --> 05:24:49.958 align:start position:0%
in a in a tiny tiny nutshell does that
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
satisfy your question okay thank you
 
05:24:53.600 --> 05:24:54.788 align:start position:0%
satisfy your question okay thank you
further

05:24:54.788 --> 05:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:24:59.788 --> 05:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um cloud seating do
 
05:25:02.270 --> 05:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
you what can you tell us your opinion is
 
05:25:03.788 --> 05:25:03.798 align:start position:0%
on the cloud seating I know that they're
 
05:25:05.948 --> 05:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
putting chemicals into the atmosphere to
 
05:25:07.830 --> 05:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
help cut down on the UV rays but can you
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
give me your opinion of how this may be
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
climate that's a neat question I mean

05:25:23.948 --> 05:25:23.958 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding basically as of the Advent
 
05:25:23.958 --> 05:25:24.750 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding basically as of the Advent
of

05:25:24.750 --> 05:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:25:26.750 --> 05:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
aircraft if I'm not mistaken the
 
05:25:29.430 --> 05:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
Russians were the first to use it and it
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
has been used and developed ever
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
since um if you understand the physics
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
of cloud formation and we talking about
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
the clouds in the in the near atmosphere
 
05:25:43.390 --> 05:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
in the lower troposphere because the
 
05:25:45.310 --> 05:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
other ones are Irrelevant for the
 
05:25:47.750 --> 05:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
precipitation so something which is
 
05:25:51.548 --> 05:25:51.558 align:start position:0%
roughly between what is it a mile and a
 
05:25:54.788 --> 05:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
mile and a half above our heads we can
 
05:25:57.390 --> 05:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
send aircraft there cheaply and Seed it
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
usually with silver chloride and the
 
05:26:02.390 --> 05:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
silver chloride particles they're tiny
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
tiny tiny so they act as attractors for
 
05:26:09.150 --> 05:26:09.160 align:start position:0%
humidity and they form form little water
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
droplets and they rise up and down and
 
05:26:14.628 --> 05:26:14.638 align:start position:0%
what is to become a growing cloud and
 
05:26:16.788 --> 05:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
once it has reached a certain density
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
and weight it'll fall off out of the
 
05:26:22.868 --> 05:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
cloud and we call it rain the problem is
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
we can't do that in a way that is truly
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
meaningful for what it is meant for to
 
05:26:30.750 --> 05:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
get precipitation where you want
 
05:26:33.708 --> 05:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
precipitation that's one thing the other
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
thing is that and that is much more
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
related to the very big picture of
 
05:26:38.360 --> 05:26:39.430 align:start position:0%
related to the very big picture of
climate

05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
climate
 
05:26:42.670 --> 05:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
change Cloud Dynamics is currently
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
changing all over the world and we don't
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
fully understand this again I would need
 
05:26:51.910 --> 05:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more time to go into more detail
 
05:26:55.788 --> 05:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
with you but the key point is that the
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
chemistry of the atmosphere sorry the
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
chemistry of the atmosphere which
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
differs from the Earth's surface to the
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
tropopause first and then further on
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
into the stratosphere and then even
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
is changing with climate change so
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's different temperatures and
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
there's different pressure
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
regimes maybe you have heard of rosby
 
05:27:23.310 --> 05:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
waves no um don't worry it is something
 
05:27:26.310 --> 05:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
that defines how much arctic cold we get
 
05:27:28.270 --> 05:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
in the winter and partly also in the
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
summer and these rosby waves they are
 
05:27:33.390 --> 05:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
basically like a roller coaster going on
 
05:27:36.750 --> 05:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
the Northern Hemisphere at about 10,000
 
05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
no what is it in feet 7,000 ft above our
 
05:27:44.070 --> 05:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
heads and they are slowing down we have
 
05:27:46.150 --> 05:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
ideas why they are slowing down but we
 
05:27:48.628 --> 05:27:48.638 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure it's a pretty recent
 
05:27:51.270 --> 05:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
phenomenon but what it does is it
 
05:27:54.390 --> 05:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
changes cloud formation and that reaches
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
down well to Florida on the Northern
 
05:27:59.948 --> 05:27:59.958 align:start position:0%
Hemisphere and the same happens on the
 
05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
southern hemisphere in a mirror image
 
05:28:04.910 --> 05:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
like form so there's many open questions
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
to that respect Cloud physics is about
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
the most complicated one right now okay
 
05:28:11.868 --> 05:28:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions seeing
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
none I'm going to call a close to
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
hcr1 you and uh the blue team will cck
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
us in one room we're going to cck us in
 
05:28:22.948 --> 05:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
the side room over here and we'll all be
 
05:28:37.030 --> 05:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.040 --> 05:29:07.030 align:start position:0%

05:37:42.230 --> 05:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay folks about a two-minute warning
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
and uh we will begin our executive
 
05:37:47.030 --> 05:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
session we're going to try to get
 
05:37:48.910 --> 05:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
through the seven remaining measures
 
05:37:51.470 --> 05:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
that this committee
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
has and I want to thank while she's
 
05:37:58.110 --> 05:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
working hard our uh interim clerk don't
 
05:37:59.070 --> 05:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
take me
 
05:38:02.868 --> 05:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
yet um represent man bomb could not be
 
05:38:02.878 --> 05:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
yet um represent man bomb could not be
here

05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:38:06.430 --> 05:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
today representative Lloyd has stepped
 
05:38:06.440 --> 05:38:07.948 align:start position:0%
today representative Lloyd has stepped
up

05:38:07.948 --> 05:38:07.958 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:38:10.350 --> 05:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
and if if it works out there could be a
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
meritorious service medal no no no
 
05:38:16.030 --> 05:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
guarantees I shouldn't say that
 
05:38:19.708 --> 05:38:19.718 align:start position:0%
early Good Conduct for sure so another
 
05:38:21.310 --> 05:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
another minute or so and we'll uh we'll
 
05:38:23.788 --> 05:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
start with HB
 
05:38:27.070 --> 05:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
264 uh that has to do with Article
 
05:38:38.230 --> 05:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.430 --> 05:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be ready in about a minute or
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll point out that we have spent uh
 
05:39:36.548 --> 05:39:36.558 align:start position:0%
time a considerable time on all seven of
 
05:39:38.948 --> 05:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
these measures for we've let everybody
 
05:39:42.390 --> 05:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
who wanted to testify to all of
 
05:39:44.910 --> 05:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
them some of them were longer hearings
 
05:39:44.920 --> 05:39:47.390 align:start position:0%
them some of them were longer hearings
than

05:39:47.390 --> 05:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
others we all have run notes we also uh
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
do check the online testimony I was just
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
on there uh last night and this morning
 
05:39:58.990 --> 05:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
myself actually and appreciate everybody
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
who does take the time to show up and th
 
05:40:06.030 --> 05:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
and those who take the time to who can't
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
show up I know if you live in Bur Orland
 
05:40:09.548 --> 05:40:09.558 align:start position:0%
and you have a job it's not easy to come
 
05:40:12.990 --> 05:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
down here to testify for 3 minutes so uh
 
05:40:15.910 --> 05:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
we take I take I'm sure we all take the
 
05:40:18.190 --> 05:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
testimony very seriously that people
 
05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
take the time to submit
 
05:40:25.628 --> 05:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
online uh in room Madam clerk you're
 
05:40:25.638 --> 05:40:26.750 align:start position:0%
online uh in room Madam clerk you're
you're

05:40:26.750 --> 05:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're
 
05:40:29.670 --> 05:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
good I think I'm all set you may have to
 
05:40:31.350 --> 05:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
guide me through some of the process but
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're good thank you
 
05:40:36.468 --> 05:40:36.478 align:start position:0%
okay so our first as I just said our
 
05:40:38.190 --> 05:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
first measure that we're going to have
 
05:40:40.190 --> 05:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
an executive session discussion and vote
 
05:40:43.350 --> 05:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
on is HB 264 Article 5 delegates I
 
05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
understand uh rep Manion you have a
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
motion pending yes I do Mr chair I move
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
OTP on hb2 64 as always we need a second
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative beler seconds so we have
 
05:40:58.510 --> 05:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
a motion of
 
05:41:02.270 --> 05:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
OTP from representative Manion in a
 
05:41:05.150 --> 05:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
second from representative Belzer
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
representative Manion would you care to
 
05:41:09.030 --> 05:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion I do thank you Mr
 
05:41:12.190 --> 05:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
chair so uh we've had like a lot of uh
 
05:41:14.150 --> 05:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
Article 5 Convention of States
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
applications come through here there are
 
05:41:17.548 --> 05:41:17.558 align:start position:0%
people who have concerns about things
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
like runaway uh conventions and things
 
05:41:22.590 --> 05:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
being proposed that may not be uh uh
 
05:41:24.430 --> 05:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
what we intended to send our delegates
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
down there to do so the a bill like this
 
05:41:29.110 --> 05:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
I think is a real strong um uh you know
 
05:41:31.270 --> 05:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
play to keep the those people's fears at
 
05:41:32.708 --> 05:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
Bay and I think it's really solid we
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
should uh pass it thank you
 
05:41:37.548 --> 05:41:37.558 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
05:41:40.628 --> 05:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
to your second nothing
 
05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
further other thoughts uh on the OTP
 
05:41:49.230 --> 05:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:53.788 --> 05:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
Lane okay um and I agree that I I have
 
05:41:55.628 --> 05:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
the same concerns about a runaway
 
05:41:59.390 --> 05:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
convention so I guess I read it and you
 
05:42:01.310 --> 05:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
have to forgive me I'm a lawyer by
 
05:42:06.868 --> 05:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
training so when I read roman numeral 2
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
it says the convention shall not support
 
05:42:13.310 --> 05:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
or approve the proposing of an
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
unauthorized Amendment to the US
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
convention and but it doesn't say and
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm assuming if they do anything
 
05:42:24.830 --> 05:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
then that's when the felony be kicks in
 
05:42:27.468 --> 05:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
what happens if the
 
05:42:30.510 --> 05:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
convention overrides I mean that that
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
delegate doesn't vote the New Hampshire
 
05:42:33.948 --> 05:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
delegate doesn't vote but everybody else
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
decides that they're going to go ahead
 
05:42:38.468 --> 05:42:38.478 align:start position:0%
with the and in create the runaway
 
05:42:38.478 --> 05:42:39.948 align:start position:0%
with the and in create the runaway
convention

05:42:39.948 --> 05:42:39.958 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
scenario what happens to the New
 
05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire delegate at that point do they
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
participate or if they participate does
 
05:42:52.830 --> 05:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
the felony be kick in a second
 
05:42:56.070 --> 05:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
time that and again I think the idea is
 
05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
good I'm just trying to make sure that
 
05:42:59.910 --> 05:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
we got the right
 
05:43:02.788 --> 05:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
wording I might be able to speak thank
 
05:43:05.628 --> 05:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
you uh rups of Manion I'm looking to
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
reps of Lan could you I just pulled out
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
the actual measure the line you
 
05:43:14.468 --> 05:43:14.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned was line 16 and 17 16 17 okay
 
05:43:15.948 --> 05:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you please speak to that if
 
05:43:18.070 --> 05:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
you could representative
 
05:43:20.830 --> 05:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
Manion right so uh you were saying that
 
05:43:23.190 --> 05:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
um if the convention goes ahead and
 
05:43:25.510 --> 05:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
passes it anyway it says here so the
 
05:43:27.030 --> 05:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
delegate from the state to an article
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
shall not support or
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
approve the proposing so as long as they
 
05:43:33.150 --> 05:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
they vote against I think they're in the
 
05:43:35.310 --> 05:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
clear doesn't really matter like as long
 
05:43:37.110 --> 05:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
as they're not the ones doing it like
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
supporting or approving
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
correct but that's the that's the
 
05:43:44.750 --> 05:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
proposing of it they can't support the
 
05:43:47.350 --> 05:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
proposing of it but once oh I see what
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
you mean but once then it gets so I
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that but then then the
 
05:43:56.390 --> 05:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
next step is oh oh dear the other 49
 
05:43:58.270 --> 05:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
states voted and the New Hampshire guy
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
didn't end so now they go zooming ahead
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I just from the English the sentence
 
05:44:07.430 --> 05:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
structure like it should to me it could
 
05:44:10.030 --> 05:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
be interpreted as shall not support or
 
05:44:16.150 --> 05:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
statements me I I think I can resolve
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
this if I may uh please resolve this
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative thank you so I I think
 
05:44:24.468 --> 05:44:24.478 align:start position:0%
the the the question we're looking at
 
05:44:25.948 --> 05:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
here is is is a question of the
 
05:44:28.510 --> 05:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
terminology but the idea behind an
 
05:44:29.708 --> 05:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
article 5
 
05:44:32.230 --> 05:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
convention the the actual effect of what
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're doing is proposing they can't
 
05:44:37.628 --> 05:44:37.638 align:start position:0%
adopt they can only prop propos because
 
05:44:39.548 --> 05:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
it would have to then be voted on by by
 
05:44:39.558 --> 05:44:41.468 align:start position:0%
it would have to then be voted on by by
States

05:44:41.468 --> 05:44:41.478 align:start position:0%
States
 
05:44:44.468 --> 05:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
so shall not support or approve the
 
05:44:46.590 --> 05:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
proposing proposing is the function that
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
they're performing so there I don't I
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually don't think that there's a
 
05:44:49.600 --> 05:44:51.150 align:start position:0%
actually don't think that there's a
problem

05:44:51.150 --> 05:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:44:54.868 --> 05:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
there representative Lloyd so I guess to
 
05:44:57.390 --> 05:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
that same point then would that preclude
 
05:45:00.030 --> 05:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
us from voting
 
05:45:02.190 --> 05:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
against at
 
05:45:05.868 --> 05:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
all what I would say to that is that the
 
05:45:07.708 --> 05:45:07.718 align:start position:0%
should this ever move forward the
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
delegates who've been selected to
 
05:45:14.150 --> 05:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
participate in such a convention uh that
 
05:45:16.070 --> 05:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
the notion that they would go off the
 
05:45:19.230 --> 05:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
reservation and deviate from their
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
expressed uh purpose for being there if
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
you'll look at lines 18 and 19 the last
 
05:45:29.868 --> 05:45:29.878 align:start position:0%
two lines of the bill uh a delegate who
 
05:45:31.868 --> 05:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
knowingly violates this section she'll
 
05:45:35.948 --> 05:45:35.958 align:start position:0%
be guilted of a class B felony and uh
 
05:45:41.190 --> 05:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
the I think that question was asked
 
05:45:45.190 --> 05:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
during the testimony though because I
 
05:45:46.708 --> 05:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
watched it on tape but I don't remember
 
05:45:49.788 --> 05:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
what the answer was M Mr
 
05:45:52.390 --> 05:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
chairman yes with regard to class B
 
05:45:54.468 --> 05:45:54.478 align:start position:0%
felony what that means go ahead
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh gagy okay thank you Mr
 
05:46:00.230 --> 05:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
chairman well first answering to class B
 
05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
FY felony that's a class B felony is
 
05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
three and a half to seven years in
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
prison if convicted that's a clasby
 
05:46:15.190 --> 05:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
felony but as I read here uh line 16 a
 
05:46:17.150 --> 05:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
delegate from the state in Article 5 it
 
05:46:19.430 --> 05:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
can be one delegate let's say we have
 
05:46:22.190 --> 05:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
four delegates and all
 
05:46:25.350 --> 05:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
four go against what the state has told
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
them that the only thing that they can
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
do then whatever they do would be Moot
 
05:46:32.350 --> 05:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
and they could all be
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
charged in my opinion with a class B
 
05:46:38.510 --> 05:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
felony because they not doing what they
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
were delegated to bring forth
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd um I I agree with
 
05:46:46.948 --> 05:46:46.958 align:start position:0%
that piece of it um representative gagy
 
05:46:49.708 --> 05:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
but um I think our biggest concern is
 
05:46:52.510 --> 05:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
that um a proposal would be made by a
 
05:46:55.468 --> 05:46:55.478 align:start position:0%
state that is not New Hampshire and
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
would that limit our delegates from
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
being able
 
05:47:04.628 --> 05:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
to um to vote in any way or or affect
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
how things go my interrup as I read this
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that it seeks to be very clear and
 
05:47:14.350 --> 05:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
very specific and very limited delegates
 
05:47:18.430 --> 05:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire would be uh mandated
 
05:47:20.350 --> 05:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
to focus on the narrow issue that they
 
05:47:23.110 --> 05:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
were selected for and if they did
 
05:47:25.230 --> 05:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
deviate from that they would be uh
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
subject to a class B felony and again is
 
05:47:30.350 --> 05:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh to reiterate what I think
 
05:47:34.510 --> 05:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative Belzer or Manion said uh
 
05:47:36.468 --> 05:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
please we need to understand this
 
05:47:38.788 --> 05:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
convention ition is simply a gathering
 
05:47:42.468 --> 05:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
to support prospective amendments the
 
05:47:45.430 --> 05:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
this convention does not make any final
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
decision or vote on any Amendment all
 
05:47:52.510 --> 05:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
they do is agree to put certain proposed
 
05:47:56.990 --> 05:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
amendments in play and then any subject
 
05:48:01.628 --> 05:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
to you know ratification later on by 38
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
States so other thoughts on any piece of
 
05:48:07.750 --> 05:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
this representative gagy
 
05:48:09.628 --> 05:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
uh getting back to the
 
05:48:14.830 --> 05:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
Penalty that class be if this um house
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 264 would pass the house here
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and get signed in uh
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
before that happens if it passes the
 
05:48:25.070 --> 05:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
house he would have to go I believe to a
 
05:48:27.030 --> 05:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
second committee like criminal justice I
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
know when I was in criminal justice we
 
05:48:31.788 --> 05:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
would get bills from other committees
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
that they that criminal justice
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
committee would just deal with with the
 
05:48:41.310 --> 05:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
the penalty portion of the bill and not
 
05:48:44.830 --> 05:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
anything else correct and what I want to
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
avoid doing is I look at this this bill
 
05:48:51.070 --> 05:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
is very very narrow all it does is with
 
05:48:53.390 --> 05:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
regard to a potential Article 5
 
05:48:55.548 --> 05:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
convention is made clear that there
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
would be a consequence if any delegate
 
05:48:59.478 --> 05:49:01.510 align:start position:0%
would be a consequence if any delegate
uh

05:49:01.510 --> 05:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh supporter approved an amendment
 
05:49:07.990 --> 05:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
not authorized by our legislature so uh
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
we don't need to get into the the
 
05:49:13.910 --> 05:49:13.920 align:start position:0%

down six to go the next one is uh a
 
05:52:53.590 --> 05:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
bigger one I I think we could say uh
 
05:52:56.270 --> 05:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's hcr3 which
 
05:52:59.468 --> 05:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
uh involves applying for a Convention of
 
05:53:01.708 --> 05:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
the states under Article 5 of The
 
05:53:05.030 --> 05:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States hcr3
 
05:53:07.708 --> 05:53:07.718 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention
 
05:53:10.110 --> 05:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
I am looking again to uh representative
 
05:53:13.510 --> 05:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
beler uh for a motion thank you Mr
 
05:53:16.468 --> 05:53:16.478 align:start position:0%
chairman I would move on to pass motion
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
from representative beler is OTP ought
 
05:53:21.548 --> 05:53:21.558 align:start position:0%
to pass is there a second second second
 
05:53:24.190 --> 05:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
from representative Manion uh
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative beler uh would you care
 
05:53:28.350 --> 05:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes thank you Mr
 
05:53:31.430 --> 05:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
chair so this motion calls for the
 
05:53:34.150 --> 05:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
application of an article 5 convention
 
05:53:37.910 --> 05:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
under specific yet relatively wide
 
05:53:40.310 --> 05:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
enough terms to look to solve some
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
problems now I'll offer my own uh non
 
05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
nonsense assessment here which is
 
05:53:49.110 --> 05:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
honestly I am a little bit skeptical
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
that it will be successful in ultimately
 
05:53:53.670 --> 05:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
reigning in the federal government but
 
05:53:56.070 --> 05:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
I'm also very skeptical that there's
 
05:53:58.948 --> 05:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
much danger involved actually the reason
 
05:54:00.670 --> 05:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
that there's not much danger involved is
 
05:54:02.190 --> 05:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
the same reason that I'm a little bit
 
05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
skeptical about the efficacy of it that
 
05:54:07.310 --> 05:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
said there is an awful lot of decent
 
05:54:09.948 --> 05:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
people who want the opportunity to try I
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
see no good reason to deprive them off
 
05:54:13.708 --> 05:54:13.718 align:start position:0%
that opportunity and I do very much hope
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
they prove me
 
05:54:18.030 --> 05:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
wrong thank you representative
 
05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative Manion to Echo uh the to
 
05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
me it's like the the specifics of this
 
05:54:25.150 --> 05:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
bill of this specific application are
 
05:54:27.750 --> 05:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
very good because the the debt is insane
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
right now it is like one of the largest
 
05:54:30.910 --> 05:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
security threats to the country right
 
05:54:32.868 --> 05:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
now the destabilization of the dollar I
 
05:54:34.030 --> 05:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
think we need to do everything in our
 
05:54:35.590 --> 05:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
power and that means from the state's
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
perspective so be we should move forward
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
with something like this thank you
 
05:54:42.150 --> 05:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative my brief comment is I
 
05:54:44.948 --> 05:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
have two comments one of which to be
 
05:54:47.628 --> 05:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
clear there are a lot of folks I hear
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
saying that an article 5 convention is
 
05:54:52.910 --> 05:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so I have to as a
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
Civics person I have to say that an
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention would be the least
 
05:55:00.430 --> 05:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional action I think could be
 
05:55:03.230 --> 05:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
taken because Article 5 is from the
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's specifically it's
 
05:55:07.430 --> 05:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
Article 5 of the United States
 
05:55:09.910 --> 05:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution so the notion that it would
 
05:55:13.310 --> 05:55:13.320 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional I that my opinion is
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with the founders who put it in
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that it could not be
 
05:55:21.030 --> 05:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
more constitutional in my humble opinion
 
05:55:22.468 --> 05:55:22.478 align:start position:0%
uh and the other point I want to make is
 
05:55:24.750 --> 05:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
that we have spent a lot of time on this
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh those of us who've been on this
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee for several terms uh it passed
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
this Committee in a bipartisan fashion
 
05:55:36.310 --> 05:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
last term uh it did not pass the full
 
05:55:39.948 --> 05:55:39.958 align:start position:0%
floor or the full house but uh I I do
 
05:55:42.510 --> 05:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
need to point out that this is a measure
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
that has passed this committee before
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
last term other thoughts comments
 
05:55:50.910 --> 05:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
questions uh on any piece of
 
05:55:53.190 --> 05:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is that a hand up Representative
 
05:55:56.190 --> 05:55:56.200 align:start position:0%

motion yeah I remember um last year this
 
06:00:13.150 --> 06:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
being the um and I don't think this was
 
06:00:16.590 --> 06:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned this time um actually yet but
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
the original sponsor of this legislation
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
um actually you know requested that this
 
06:00:25.030 --> 06:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
be resented and I know being in their
 
06:00:27.548 --> 06:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
position I would want the I would you
 
06:00:29.110 --> 06:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
know like it if somebody did the same
 
06:00:32.788 --> 06:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
for me um if I had second thoughts or
 
06:00:35.070 --> 06:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
you know you know later down the road
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
saw any unintended consequences um so
 
06:00:42.510 --> 06:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just my statement on that so
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
06:00:47.708 --> 06:00:47.718 align:start position:0%
budak you seconded the OTP I 100% agreed
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
with what cyber
 
06:00:54.590 --> 06:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
said okay now I'll point out that if any
 
06:00:57.390 --> 06:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
measure fails uh if an OTP measure fails
 
06:01:00.628 --> 06:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
we would need an alternate motion which
 
06:01:01.990 --> 06:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
may or may not happen we'll have to see
 
06:01:05.310 --> 06:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
what the votes are so other thoughts on
 
06:01:06.468 --> 06:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
the OTP
 
06:01:08.590 --> 06:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
motion representative
 
06:01:12.150 --> 06:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair I having just
 
06:01:14.948 --> 06:01:14.958 align:start position:0%
voted for a new call for an article 5
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
convention I I see no reason to resend
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
and perhaps artificially narrow the the
 
06:01:22.430 --> 06:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
potential circumstances of a future
 
06:01:24.468 --> 06:01:24.478 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention and to the other
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
issue I would I would simply say with no
 
06:01:28.708 --> 06:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
disrespect whatsoever to the original
 
06:01:31.590 --> 06:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
initiating member some years ago once
 
06:01:33.830 --> 06:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
you've uh filed legislation and that
 
06:01:35.350 --> 06:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislation gets voted on in the house
 
06:01:37.390 --> 06:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
it's no longer a members legislation
 
06:01:41.310 --> 06:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
it's house legislation um so there's no
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
impetus to withdraw uh at that point
 
06:01:45.990 --> 06:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
Thank you you're saying that someone
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't feel personal ownership of a
 
06:01:51.190 --> 06:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
of a measure once and that's a point
 
06:01:53.150 --> 06:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
well taken I think that those of us who
 
06:01:55.788 --> 06:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
have had measures in the past we need to
 
06:01:57.948 --> 06:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh understand that once we give it to a
 
06:01:59.430 --> 06:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee the committee owns it and then
 
06:02:01.150 --> 06:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
the house owns it if it moves forward
 
06:02:03.390 --> 06:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good point repr man did
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
you have a hand up
 
06:02:07.990 --> 06:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that representative
 
06:02:10.750 --> 06:02:10.760 align:start position:0%

having just voted for an article 5
 
06:05:12.548 --> 06:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
convention possibly conflict with that
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
in any way by now resending
 
06:05:18.190 --> 06:05:18.200 align:start position:0%

hearing on that a week ago uh
 
06:07:43.910 --> 06:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bela was the sponsor I'm
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
going to look to him for a motion on the
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
measure that he was the for which he was
 
06:07:50.468 --> 06:07:50.478 align:start position:0%
the Prime
 
06:07:52.750 --> 06:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you Mr chairman I'll move
 
06:07:54.310 --> 06:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
a to
 
06:07:58.390 --> 06:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
pass OTP motion by representative beler
 
06:08:00.910 --> 06:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
on hjr one ought to pass is there a
 
06:08:03.590 --> 06:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
second second represent Manion thank you
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
uh seconding that representative
 
06:08:09.548 --> 06:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
Bel I'm going to ask you to uh take some
 
06:08:12.110 --> 06:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
time if you would uh it was a month a
 
06:08:13.868 --> 06:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
month it was a week ago that we heard
 
06:08:18.548 --> 06:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
this and I know that not everybody was
 
06:08:21.590 --> 06:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
completely clear on on it all so if you
 
06:08:24.110 --> 06:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
if you could uh provide some clarity at
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
this time that would be representative
 
06:08:28.750 --> 06:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
CRA is agreeing with me so uh if you
 
06:08:31.150 --> 06:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
could provide some clarity yes I thank
 
06:08:33.628 --> 06:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr Cher I will attempt to do so uh
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
in retrospect in hindsight I tried to
 
06:08:38.548 --> 06:08:38.558 align:start position:0%
hit the pragmatic passion portions of
 
06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
this resolution and limit the depth I
 
06:08:43.230 --> 06:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
was delving into the more philosophical
 
06:08:45.750 --> 06:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
aspects the questions seemingly revealed
 
06:08:47.628 --> 06:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
that there was a much more interest in
 
06:08:49.628 --> 06:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
those aspects so I'd like to take just
 
06:08:51.230 --> 06:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
two or three minutes here to run through
 
06:08:53.270 --> 06:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
that real quick what the point is the
 
06:08:56.628 --> 06:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill
 
06:09:00.270 --> 06:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
so ideas have consequences and the
 
06:09:03.150 --> 06:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
internal logic of the ideas held by any
 
06:09:05.948 --> 06:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
society will tend to overtime
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
see themselves worked out toward their
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
logical conclusions the framework that
 
06:09:12.750 --> 06:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
the American government was created
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
under was a particular set of ideas that
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
fit together and work together toward a
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
coherent and cohesive whole the
 
06:09:24.628 --> 06:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
foundational principles of American
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
government simply do not work when you
 
06:09:30.548 --> 06:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
begin to substitute in other alternative
 
06:09:34.030 --> 06:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
ideas where the founding ideas
 
06:09:36.150 --> 06:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
were so
 
06:09:37.750 --> 06:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
let's describe what we're really getting
 
06:09:39.830 --> 06:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
at here is the concept of
 
06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
Ethics uh throughout the history of
 
06:09:45.270 --> 06:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
Western Civilization there have been two
 
06:09:48.708 --> 06:09:48.718 align:start position:0%
primary different tract for ethics there
 
06:09:53.270 --> 06:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
has been the trative ethics that comes
 
06:09:53.280 --> 06:09:54.350 align:start position:0%
has been the trative ethics that comes
from

06:09:54.350 --> 06:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:09:57.468 --> 06:09:57.478 align:start position:0%
the primarily from the Greeks the
 
06:10:01.150 --> 06:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
philosophers Plato Aristotle this line
 
06:10:03.230 --> 06:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
of thought continued down through
 
06:10:06.468 --> 06:10:06.478 align:start position:0%
history Through the Ages um right
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
through uh rouso and Hegel leading up to
 
06:10:12.150 --> 06:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
the political philosoph some of the
 
06:10:14.510 --> 06:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
political philosophies of modern
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
time now these ideas these ethics are
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
derived really they were laid out well
 
06:10:23.190 --> 06:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
by Aristotle in his book nikachi and
 
06:10:25.948 --> 06:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
ethics where he lays the basis for moral
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
relativism and what that means is He
 
06:10:31.310 --> 06:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
suggests that the idea the ethical ideal
 
06:10:34.350 --> 06:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
the good is found in the middle between
 
06:10:36.110 --> 06:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
two extremes
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
so you've got two different ideas and
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
what is good according to Aristotle is
 
06:10:42.310 --> 06:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to be found in the middle of those
 
06:10:45.990 --> 06:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
two things that's relativistic
 
06:10:49.430 --> 06:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
ethics this continued throughout history
 
06:10:51.510 --> 06:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
This Thread this idea of the of
 
06:10:54.868 --> 06:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
relativistic Ethics through Russo's
 
06:10:57.310 --> 06:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
concept of the general
 
06:11:00.150 --> 06:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
will and Russo's Concepts were picked up
 
06:11:02.830 --> 06:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
later by philosopher Hegel through his
 
06:11:06.190 --> 06:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
concept the state is the Divine idea
 
06:11:09.430 --> 06:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
now there is a political system that is
 
06:11:12.468 --> 06:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
the product of this philosophical threat
 
06:11:15.430 --> 06:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
of ideas and that political system is
 
06:11:15.440 --> 06:11:17.868 align:start position:0%
of ideas and that political system is
called

06:11:17.868 --> 06:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:17.878 --> 06:11:19.468 align:start position:0%
 
democracy

06:11:19.468 --> 06:11:19.478 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
06:11:21.788 --> 06:11:21.798 align:start position:0%
democracy was not a very wellth thought
 
06:11:24.830 --> 06:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
of concept by the American Founders if
 
06:11:26.430 --> 06:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
you look at what they had to say about
 
06:11:28.708 --> 06:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
it particularly in The Federalist Papers
 
06:11:30.510 --> 06:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
they engineered a government a
 
06:11:33.190 --> 06:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
government unique in the history of the
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
world that Blended ele ments from very
 
06:11:38.990 --> 06:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
many different systems but they sought
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
specifically to avoid the pitfalls of
 
06:11:44.070 --> 06:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
democracy that suggest that the general
 
06:11:46.830 --> 06:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
will or the greatest number of people
 
06:11:48.708 --> 06:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the right idea about
 
06:11:50.590 --> 06:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
things because what happens is when you
 
06:11:52.788 --> 06:11:52.798 align:start position:0%
do that when you assume that the
 
06:11:54.788 --> 06:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
greatest number of people have the right
 
06:11:57.150 --> 06:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
idea about things that means that they
 
06:11:58.910 --> 06:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
can take your rights away with a simple
 
06:12:02.150 --> 06:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
majority vote that was not the idea that
 
06:12:04.590 --> 06:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
American government was founded on the
 
06:12:06.150 --> 06:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
idea that American government was
 
06:12:08.190 --> 06:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
founded on was the other tract of
 
06:12:10.390 --> 06:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
thought that has been with us also for a
 
06:12:12.390 --> 06:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
very long time and that is the
 
06:12:14.590 --> 06:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
judeo-christian concept of a
 
06:12:16.510 --> 06:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
Transcendent ethic which is where that
 
06:12:18.190 --> 06:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
word Transcendent from the resolution
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
comes from the idea of a Transcendent
 
06:12:23.070 --> 06:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
ethic means that there is something
 
06:12:26.230 --> 06:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
above government that government is not
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
the last and final Arbiter of Truth ex
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
represent yeah I'd like to call point of
 
06:12:42.830 --> 06:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:45.830 --> 06:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you repr saber I I did ask the uh
 
06:12:47.948 --> 06:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor to provide some
 
06:12:50.590 --> 06:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
clarity which which past two or three
 
06:12:53.628 --> 06:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
minutes at this point uh so represent
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
beler if you could just just just to be
 
06:12:58.230 --> 06:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
clear about a point of order if there is
 
06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
a if there is a motion to move the
 
06:13:01.548 --> 06:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
question I'm happy to hear it and we can
 
06:13:03.310 --> 06:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
take a vote on it otherwise I believe I
 
06:13:04.948 --> 06:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
have the privilege to speak as a member
 
06:13:06.510 --> 06:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
Cor correct you've already had the
 
06:13:09.310 --> 06:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity as a prime sponsor you know
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
right well procedurally uh a you can
 
06:13:16.270 --> 06:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
call the question uh and if you're doing
 
06:13:18.590 --> 06:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
that then we'll we'll vote on call we
 
06:13:20.590 --> 06:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
not have a time limit then on this for
 
06:13:20.600 --> 06:13:22.150 align:start position:0%
not have a time limit then on this for
like

06:13:22.150 --> 06:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:13:24.430 --> 06:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
five I think we're going past the two or
 
06:13:26.350 --> 06:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
three minutes here well it was me that
 
06:13:27.990 --> 06:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
asked him to provide some clarity
 
06:13:30.830 --> 06:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
because uh I I think some of us wanted
 
06:13:34.510 --> 06:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
to get better Clarity or understanding
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the in
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
because as I said at the uh initial
 
06:13:39.350 --> 06:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
hearing I thought the the measure was
 
06:13:41.590 --> 06:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat esoteric and so I know we've
 
06:13:44.990 --> 06:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
been reading it in processing it so uh
 
06:13:47.350 --> 06:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
represent Bel I'd ask you to if you can
 
06:13:48.910 --> 06:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
wrap up and we're getting very near the
 
06:13:51.110 --> 06:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
end of what iend to finish your your
 
06:13:53.430 --> 06:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
your Clarity Mission please yeah thank
 
06:13:55.430 --> 06:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you so as I was saying the
 
06:13:56.708 --> 06:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
system of government set up by the
 
06:13:59.990 --> 06:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
founders unique in world history Place
 
06:14:02.110 --> 06:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
something above government meaning
 
06:14:03.468 --> 06:14:03.478 align:start position:0%
government doesn't get to take your
 
06:14:06.868 --> 06:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
rights away rights are there
 
06:14:08.788 --> 06:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
inalienable and that is what I was
 
06:14:10.670 --> 06:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
getting at when I talked about the idea
 
06:14:17.670 --> 06:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:22.070 --> 06:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
resolution representative second the the
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
measure do you want to add to that I
 
06:14:27.070 --> 06:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
think he nailed
 
06:14:32.350 --> 06:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
it other comments questions on H jr5 and
 
06:14:35.548 --> 06:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
again or H jr1 I'm sorry uh the intent
 
06:14:39.390 --> 06:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
of this resolution was to or is to
 
06:14:42.190 --> 06:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
affirm the natural right of persons and
 
06:14:44.070 --> 06:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
affirm that the state and federal
 
06:14:45.788 --> 06:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
government are established for the
 
06:14:47.670 --> 06:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of upholding protecting and
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
securing these rights I'm getting it
 
06:14:53.150 --> 06:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
better uh than I did I I know I asked
 
06:14:56.430 --> 06:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
you to take some time to explain that
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
question any anything else questions go
 
06:15:00.830 --> 06:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
ahead represent
 
06:15:03.390 --> 06:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
jnes thank you uh just procedurally Mr
 
06:15:06.468 --> 06:15:06.478 align:start position:0%
chair uh we have some new people here if
 
06:15:08.548 --> 06:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
you could explain the difference as you
 
06:15:10.750 --> 06:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
did for me when I first came on board a
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
didactic moment just explain the
 
06:15:13.910 --> 06:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
difference between a resolution in HCR
 
06:15:16.910 --> 06:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
and an hjr sure uh thank you represent
 
06:15:18.628 --> 06:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
Jones and I know as I always like to
 
06:15:20.590 --> 06:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
point out there are people watching at
 
06:15:24.390 --> 06:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
home so an HR is a house resolution that
 
06:15:27.070 --> 06:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
is strictly uh a product of the house if
 
06:15:28.830 --> 06:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
it passes the committee or even if it
 
06:15:30.430 --> 06:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass the committee still goes to
 
06:15:31.910 --> 06:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
the house and the house votes on it and
 
06:15:33.510 --> 06:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
if it passes then whatever the
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
resolution said I.E
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
resolution passed by the house for
 
06:15:40.270 --> 06:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
whatever goes to whatever it's
 
06:15:42.750 --> 06:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
designated to the federal delegation or
 
06:15:44.468 --> 06:15:44.478 align:start position:0%
the president of United States or
 
06:15:47.628 --> 06:15:47.638 align:start position:0%
whatever an HCR house concurrent
 
06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
resolution involves both houses the
 
06:15:53.830 --> 06:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house so if this were to
 
06:15:58.070 --> 06:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
be an HCR would have to go from this if
 
06:16:00.390 --> 06:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
it passes this body it would go to the
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
Senate and if it passes that body then
 
06:16:05.070 --> 06:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
it would go to wherever it was meant to
 
06:16:09.310 --> 06:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
be shared or directed to uh an hjr which
 
06:16:12.150 --> 06:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
is what this is a house joint
 
06:16:14.468 --> 06:16:14.478 align:start position:0%
resolution would go through the house if
 
06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
it makes it through the house it would
 
06:16:17.788 --> 06:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and if it makes it
 
06:16:19.350 --> 06:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
through the Senate then it also goes to
 
06:16:22.110 --> 06:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
the governor so the governor has a a a
 
06:16:24.868 --> 06:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
chance has a bite at this apple too to
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh support or not so hopefully that uh
 
06:16:31.310 --> 06:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
clarifies those three different types of
 
06:16:35.830 --> 06:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
resolutions this is an hjr hjr 1
 
06:16:38.750 --> 06:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh other anything else on the measure
 
06:16:38.760 --> 06:16:40.750 align:start position:0%
uh other anything else on the measure
before

06:16:40.750 --> 06:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:16:43.910 --> 06:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
us uh representative gagy I saw you
 
06:16:46.670 --> 06:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
first go ahead very quickly
 
06:16:49.070 --> 06:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher your explanation
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
I get
 
06:16:54.788 --> 06:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
it explanation what the
 
06:16:56.990 --> 06:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative Representatives the
 
06:16:59.788 --> 06:16:59.798 align:start position:0%
representative belcher's
 
06:17:02.390 --> 06:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
explanation now I get it I really you
 
06:17:04.628 --> 06:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
know I I I was in the weeds a little bit
 
06:17:07.548 --> 06:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
but now I get it yeah the word was
 
06:17:09.190 --> 06:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
esoteric that I used thank you for
 
06:17:10.350 --> 06:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
taking the time for that representative
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
Bennett go ahead I just want to say
 
06:17:15.628 --> 06:17:15.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification and I
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
really do think that this is a extremely
 
06:17:22.868 --> 06:17:22.878 align:start position:0%
important um thing that we present and I
 
06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
like the uh
 
06:17:28.390 --> 06:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
careful choice of words to make sure
 
06:17:32.548 --> 06:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
that we include everyone because that's
 
06:17:35.150 --> 06:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
basically what our country
 
06:17:38.430 --> 06:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
is so great for is our unalienable
 
06:17:40.510 --> 06:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
rights thank you thank you
 
06:17:41.910 --> 06:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bennett representative
 
06:17:46.750 --> 06:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
Lloyd thank you um I just I think for me
 
06:17:49.708 --> 06:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
um looking at this I I don't disagree at
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
all with the message behind it um I
 
06:17:55.468 --> 06:17:55.478 align:start position:0%
think for me it's more of uh I don't
 
06:17:57.230 --> 06:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
know that I'm necessarily seeing the
 
06:18:00.150 --> 06:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
necessity of it at this moment in time
 
06:18:03.468 --> 06:18:03.478 align:start position:0%
um so I yeah that's kind of I just want
 
06:18:06.830 --> 06:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
to throw that point out there thank you
 
06:18:08.830 --> 06:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd representative
 
06:18:12.750 --> 06:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
saber so I I feel the exact same way we
 
06:18:14.788 --> 06:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
this it said it comes directly from the
 
06:18:17.670 --> 06:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights and I mean we already um
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
recognize all of that in our law um
 
06:18:22.628 --> 06:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
furthermore I just have to say um the
 
06:18:24.948 --> 06:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
parts that was very offputting for me
 
06:18:27.390 --> 06:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
personally was the parts mening the
 
06:18:30.190 --> 06:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
judeo-christian value all of that well
 
06:18:31.910 --> 06:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat we agree on that I feel like
 
06:18:33.548 --> 06:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
when the lines start to get blurred
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
between the separation of church and
 
06:18:38.350 --> 06:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
state that is ultimately where democracy
 
06:18:42.310 --> 06:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
Falls so I will um not be voting in
 
06:18:44.910 --> 06:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation thank
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%

to resend my OTP measure if uh we
 
06:21:48.670 --> 06:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
haven't voted on that so I'm just going
 
06:21:50.830 --> 06:21:50.840 align:start position:0%

I resend my second thank you
 
06:21:57.030 --> 06:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins yes so before we
 
06:21:59.070 --> 06:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
go to uh take another motion you all
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
should have a copy of an amendment which
 
06:22:04.030 --> 06:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
I will speak to the amendment so
 
06:22:06.670 --> 06:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
proceeds usually what is happening here
 
06:22:09.310 --> 06:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
is we're I am going to introduce the
 
06:22:11.788 --> 06:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
amendment yes go ahead just a quick a
 
06:22:12.990 --> 06:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
point of order I just want to make sure
 
06:22:14.670 --> 06:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
we we accomplish this in the correct
 
06:22:17.310 --> 06:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
manner am I mistaken in thinking that we
 
06:22:19.150 --> 06:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
need an OTP motion on the table to
 
06:22:21.310 --> 06:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment yes that's what
 
06:22:23.628 --> 06:22:23.638 align:start position:0%
I'm about to do okay excellent uh right
 
06:22:28.510 --> 06:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
so the OTP motion on the measure itself
 
06:22:31.868 --> 06:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
was rescinded and now I am making a I'm
 
06:22:34.708 --> 06:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
introducing an amendment
 
06:22:36.270 --> 06:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
which you all
 
06:22:38.670 --> 06:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
have or should
 
06:22:41.990 --> 06:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
have Mr chair
 
06:22:44.910 --> 06:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
chairman sure I think the representative
 
06:22:47.070 --> 06:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
was right I think you need the OTP
 
06:22:48.590 --> 06:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
motion and then the amendment you have
 
06:22:52.310 --> 06:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
to introduce the motion of OTP on the
 
06:22:56.910 --> 06:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:01.948 --> 06:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
amendment so procedurally we need an OTP
 
06:23:06.310 --> 06:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
motion on the original
 
06:23:10.310 --> 06:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
Bill and then the amendment and then I
 
06:23:12.190 --> 06:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
have an I want okay I want to make sure
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's had a chance to look at the
 
06:23:19.070 --> 06:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:21.590 --> 06:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
assuming does anybody need
 
06:23:24.788 --> 06:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
one it's the the amendment is uh just
 
06:23:59.390 --> 06:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:01.070 --> 06:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh we're going to do the same thing
 
06:24:03.430 --> 06:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
we did last week with an when we had an
 
06:24:06.230 --> 06:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
amendment the motion is going to be on
 
06:24:10.110 --> 06:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment first if the amendment
 
06:24:12.350 --> 06:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
passes then the next motion will be on
 
06:24:14.788 --> 06:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
the OTP on the measure as amended if the
 
06:24:17.350 --> 06:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
amendment fails then we'll go to the
 
06:24:20.868 --> 06:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
original measure so I am introducing at
 
06:24:24.310 --> 06:24:24.320 align:start position:0%

0318 changing the one
 
06:25:46.548 --> 06:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
word so before I ask the clerk to call
 
06:25:49.270 --> 06:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
the role on the amendment I will make
 
06:25:52.230 --> 06:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
I'll Point make a comment on Amendment
 
06:25:54.990 --> 06:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
processes when I was a a freshman
 
06:25:56.350 --> 06:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
legislator I was in a different
 
06:25:59.270 --> 06:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee and an amendment was
 
06:26:02.628 --> 06:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
introduced and I noticed that uh was a
 
06:26:05.310 --> 06:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
rep a representative from Bo at the time
 
06:26:07.390 --> 06:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh who voted for the
 
06:26:10.150 --> 06:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
amendment and then subsequently when we
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
had the the
 
06:26:16.110 --> 06:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
otpa motion the same representative
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
voted against the otpa so being a
 
06:26:23.430 --> 06:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
Freshman rookie I uh was a little bit
 
06:26:25.310 --> 06:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
confused why did she vote for it and
 
06:26:27.190 --> 06:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
then against it and I asked her about
 
06:26:29.190 --> 06:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
that afterwards and she said and I
 
06:26:32.430 --> 06:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
learned something uh she said I voted
 
06:26:33.948 --> 06:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
for the amendment because it made it a
 
06:26:36.230 --> 06:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
better Bill if it went forward she was
 
06:26:39.030 --> 06:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
not in favor of the bill but she knew or
 
06:26:40.868 --> 06:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
felt that the amendment improved the
 
06:26:43.990 --> 06:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill I said aha okay so I I get that so
 
06:26:45.548 --> 06:26:45.558 align:start position:0%
that that's the one point I want to make
 
06:26:50.510 --> 06:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
to uh anyone here uh who may not like
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
the bill or the measure but if you think
 
06:26:54.830 --> 06:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
that the amendment makes it better you
 
06:26:56.990 --> 06:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
can certainly vote for the amendment and
 
06:26:58.590 --> 06:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
then vote against
 
06:27:01.788 --> 06:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
otpa so all that said Madam clerk when
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
you're ready the uh motion is on Mr
 
06:27:06.430 --> 06:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
chairman go ahead yeah yeah on the
 
06:27:08.990 --> 06:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment can we not uh simply have a
 
06:27:12.670 --> 06:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
show of hands it's been done in the past
 
06:27:15.390 --> 06:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you representative gagy
 
06:27:18.030 --> 06:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
veteran legislator last week we did on
 
06:27:19.788 --> 06:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
an amendment we did a show of hands to
 
06:27:22.628 --> 06:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
save some time and I'm going to do that
 
06:27:25.990 --> 06:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
again so I'm going to ask that if you're
 
06:27:29.150 --> 06:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of Amendment
 
06:27:31.750 --> 06:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
03188 which changes the word repeal to
 
06:27:44.948 --> 06:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:44.958 --> 06:27:46.270 align:start position:0%
 
all

06:27:46.270 --> 06:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:27:49.750 --> 06:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
right the clerk has 17 for zero against
 
06:27:51.190 --> 06:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment so the amendment is
 
06:27:54.788 --> 06:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
adopted now uh my next motion is going
 
06:27:56.510 --> 06:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
06:27:59.150 --> 06:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
otpa uh to pass as amended we've
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
approved the amendment
 
06:28:04.430 --> 06:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
on the
 
06:28:06.270 --> 06:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
the Jones act
 
06:28:09.990 --> 06:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
measure and as I just said a couple a
 
06:28:11.510 --> 06:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
few minutes
 
06:28:13.628 --> 06:28:13.638 align:start position:0%
ago you've already been here today
 
06:28:15.990 --> 06:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard me speak at Great length on
 
06:28:17.350 --> 06:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
this I'm not going to repeat everything
 
06:28:19.830 --> 06:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
I just said a short time ago uh you also
 
06:28:22.310 --> 06:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
heard uh other testimony both for and
 
06:28:24.510 --> 06:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
against so all that said I've made the
 
06:28:27.670 --> 06:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
motion and um certainly W welcome anyone
 
06:28:30.190 --> 06:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
who wants to speak to any aspect of uh
 
06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Jones act at this time
 
06:28:33.788 --> 06:28:33.798 align:start position:0%
representative Manion go ahead I think
 
06:28:35.868 --> 06:28:35.878 align:start position:0%
the the the word choice of changing to
 
06:28:37.468 --> 06:28:37.478 align:start position:0%
reform is good because like a lot of
 
06:28:38.750 --> 06:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
times we run into these situations where
 
06:28:40.670 --> 06:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
they end up waving the Jones act like
 
06:28:41.788 --> 06:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
left right and Center every time there's
 
06:28:43.468 --> 06:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
a crisis so there's obviously some kind
 
06:28:45.510 --> 06:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
of flawed with the existing system that
 
06:28:46.628 --> 06:28:46.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should put some kind of
 
06:28:48.190 --> 06:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
automatic system in there I don't know
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
what the resolution here would be I
 
06:28:52.468 --> 06:28:52.478 align:start position:0%
support full repeal but I'm happy to
 
06:28:53.510 --> 06:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
meet in the
 
06:28:55.788 --> 06:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
middle thank you representative Manion
 
06:28:58.350 --> 06:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr Sher
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
and as a actual co-sponsor of the
 
06:29:02.590 --> 06:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
original legislation I I very much
 
06:29:04.548 --> 06:29:04.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate and approve of the
 
06:29:06.270 --> 06:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
the minor change in language I think it
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
improves it dramatically because I not
 
06:29:12.190 --> 06:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
being a pure economic libertarian I do
 
06:29:13.948 --> 06:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate certain aspects of protect
 
06:29:17.030 --> 06:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
protectionism at times but the fact is

it

06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%

06:30:04.350 --> 06:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
um I gave you my word that if you made
 
06:30:05.670 --> 06:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
that amendment that I would vote for it
 
06:30:07.990 --> 06:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
so will be voting for
 
06:30:13.150 --> 06:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:15.948 --> 06:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative
 
06:30:18.750 --> 06:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
Lloyd thank you Mr chairman um the
 
06:30:21.190 --> 06:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is great and I really
 
06:30:23.350 --> 06:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate the working with us on the
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um unfortunately I'm probably
 
06:30:28.670 --> 06:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
still going to vote against the the
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
measure um only because um after hearing
 
06:30:34.468 --> 06:30:34.478 align:start position:0%
the test
 
06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
I think that they were still saying that
 
06:30:39.910 --> 06:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
as is there is still a workaround
 
06:30:42.510 --> 06:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
process but I think that this amendment
 
06:30:47.070 --> 06:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
should this pass makes it much better
 
06:30:51.548 --> 06:30:51.558 align:start position:0%

testimony earlier today that should be
 
06:33:39.910 --> 06:33:39.920 align:start position:0%

that are are watching the executive
 
06:34:09.070 --> 06:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
session who didn't maybe didn't watch
 
06:34:11.510 --> 06:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the hearing if you
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
could just summarize for people so they
 
06:34:16.590 --> 06:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
know what we're talking about here sure
 
06:34:18.070 --> 06:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
I won't believe the point but I'll offer
 
06:34:20.548 --> 06:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
a quick summary which is that for most
 
06:34:23.310 --> 06:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
of America's modern history there had
 
06:34:26.910 --> 06:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
been a a federal law prohibiting the
 
06:34:29.590 --> 06:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
propagandizing and use of uh federal
 
06:34:32.030 --> 06:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
government information Warfare against
 
06:34:35.310 --> 06:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
the American people that was repealed
 
06:34:39.310 --> 06:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
with the 2013 smithm modernization act
 
06:34:42.430 --> 06:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
in the time since then we have seen a
 
06:34:46.230 --> 06:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
significant growth industry in the field
 
06:34:48.150 --> 06:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
of government deciding that it wants to
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
be the Arbiter of Truth um in very many
 
06:34:53.910 --> 06:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
ways nonpartisan ways even from
 
06:34:57.190 --> 06:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
everything from covid-19 to Foreign Wars
 
06:35:00.548 --> 06:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
and domestic politics it has weighed in
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
and it is time that we ask the federal
 
06:35:04.590 --> 06:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
government to
 
06:35:07.230 --> 06:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
reinstitute this prohibition on
 
06:35:10.910 --> 06:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:14.310 --> 06:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
soil and represent gagy you made the
 
06:35:14.320 --> 06:35:16.350 align:start position:0%
soil and represent gagy you made the
second

06:35:16.350 --> 06:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
second
 
06:35:18.670 --> 06:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
ditto thank you
 
06:35:21.628 --> 06:35:21.638 align:start position:0%
representative this during the earlier
 
06:35:23.750 --> 06:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on this measure it came up uh
 
06:35:27.430 --> 06:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
the US Aid thing uh which is very
 
06:35:29.150 --> 06:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
prominently in the news this does tie
 
06:35:30.910 --> 06:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
into that somewhat so it is somewhat
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
relevant uh we had earlier discussion on
 
06:35:36.310 --> 06:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
on that uh and it was pointed out that
 
06:35:38.788 --> 06:35:38.798 align:start position:0%
this measure was put in uh months ago
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
before the recent develop developments
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
of this week in terms of government
 
06:35:45.788 --> 06:35:45.798 align:start position:0%
funding going
 
06:35:48.830 --> 06:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
to uh medor outlets and that type of
 
06:35:51.430 --> 06:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
thing other thoughts questions comments
 
06:35:53.270 --> 06:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh cyber and then
 
06:35:55.590 --> 06:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative Manion with this I just
 
06:35:58.070 --> 06:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
can't get past the hypocrisy and regards
 
06:36:00.150 --> 06:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
to I don't know the federal government
 
06:36:02.350 --> 06:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
being always the issue when it's like
 
06:36:04.910 --> 06:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
definitely corporate media Outlets
 
06:36:07.510 --> 06:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
causing a huge part of the problem in
 
06:36:10.910 --> 06:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
the misinformation that goes around so I
 
06:36:13.830 --> 06:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
will not be supporting this
 
06:36:15.788 --> 06:36:15.798 align:start position:0%
measure thank you representative
 
06:36:18.990 --> 06:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manion go ahead so uh
 
06:36:20.548 --> 06:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
even though it all occurred before this
 
06:36:22.510 --> 06:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
modernization act we all remember like
 
06:36:24.150 --> 06:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
the global war on terror and the the
 
06:36:25.868 --> 06:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
weapons of mass destruction I can't even
 
06:36:28.190 --> 06:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
imagine how much worse those lies would
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been should the had the federal
 
06:36:31.510 --> 06:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
government put an even heavier thumb on
 
06:36:33.628 --> 06:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
the scale to propagandize the United
 
06:36:37.388 --> 06:36:37.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:43.750 --> 06:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:49.190 --> 06:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay seeing no other hands up
 
06:36:54.350 --> 06:36:54.360 align:start position:0%

measure it's
 
06:38:58.150 --> 06:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
hcr1 it's the climate resolution it's
 
06:39:01.670 --> 06:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
the one that I introduced uh earlier
 
06:39:03.990 --> 06:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon just a short time ago
 
06:39:06.468 --> 06:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
as the prime sponsor I am going to make
 
06:39:10.350 --> 06:39:10.360 align:start position:0%
an OTP uh motion I Mo motion ought to
 
06:39:11.670 --> 06:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
pass on
 
06:39:15.708 --> 06:39:15.718 align:start position:0%
hcr1 I will second that thank you rep
 
06:39:18.230 --> 06:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative gagy seconding the OTP
 
06:39:20.230 --> 06:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
motion I will speak to my motion I will
 
06:39:22.990 --> 06:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
not speak much to it because uh just a
 
06:39:25.270 --> 06:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
very short time ago I went on for a long
 
06:39:28.910 --> 06:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
time making the case for it uh the
 
06:39:31.868 --> 06:39:31.878 align:start position:0%
climate resolution the premise of it was
 
06:39:35.070 --> 06:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
simply to Embrace and
 
06:39:38.388 --> 06:39:38.398 align:start position:0%
encourage consideration of all
 
06:39:41.230 --> 06:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
perspectives when making climate policy
 
06:39:43.468 --> 06:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
uh I follow that up by giving many
 
06:39:45.190 --> 06:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
examples of what I thought and the
 
06:39:48.110 --> 06:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors thought were examples of some
 
06:39:49.868 --> 06:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
perspectives that were getting in our
 
06:39:52.750 --> 06:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
view short Sheriff uh there
 
06:39:55.548 --> 06:39:55.558 align:start position:0%
were numerous uh or or a good number of
 
06:39:57.190 --> 06:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
folks who testified on both sides of
 
06:39:59.070 --> 06:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
that subsequently I thought the
 
06:40:01.590 --> 06:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
testimony was was very good on both
 
06:40:03.990 --> 06:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
sides so I'm not not going to repeat
 
06:40:05.590 --> 06:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
everything that you just heard other
 
06:40:07.628 --> 06:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
than uh I hope that the committee will
 
06:40:10.628 --> 06:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
move this forward for the reasons that I
 
06:40:12.388 --> 06:40:12.398 align:start position:0%
expressed a great length a short time
 
06:40:14.990 --> 06:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
ago representative gagy you made the
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
second uh would you like to add anything
 
06:40:21.190 --> 06:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
no it's all pretty concise I just want
 
06:40:22.948 --> 06:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
everybody to get together know what
 
06:40:24.910 --> 06:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking about and come to some
 
06:40:28.670 --> 06:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a consensus to uh to figure this
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
thing out that's
 
06:40:34.868 --> 06:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
all on climate change policy other
 
06:40:37.868 --> 06:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative cyber when part
 
06:40:40.270 --> 06:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill calls oneide being an
 
06:40:42.510 --> 06:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
alarmist I was like perfectly fine when
 
06:40:44.990 --> 06:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
the guys came in here and were willing
 
06:40:46.990 --> 06:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
to seemingly come together but that's
 
06:40:49.388 --> 06:40:49.398 align:start position:0%
not something I ever see within the
 
06:40:52.510 --> 06:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
state house when it comes to either side
 
06:40:54.910 --> 06:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
um and so it also doesn't seem when
 
06:40:56.670 --> 06:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
we're passing a piece of legislation
 
06:40:59.030 --> 06:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that uses the term and accuses one side
 
06:41:01.150 --> 06:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
of being alarmist that that's not just
 
06:41:04.190 --> 06:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
completely one-sided in of itself
 
06:41:06.468 --> 06:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
also I am going to vote against this
 
06:41:08.788 --> 06:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
because I come here every day and I get
 
06:41:11.548 --> 06:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
elected for the reasons of coming here
 
06:41:14.190 --> 06:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
to be objective for two sides or
 
06:41:16.150 --> 06:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
whatever side you know looking at for
 
06:41:18.510 --> 06:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
all different standpoints and how it can
 
06:41:20.868 --> 06:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
do damage and that's what I come here
 
06:41:22.628 --> 06:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
already prepared to do and I'm sorry
 
06:41:23.788 --> 06:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
that there's people in this room that
 
06:41:26.270 --> 06:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
06:41:28.270 --> 06:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
already thank you
 
06:41:30.430 --> 06:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh go ahead
 
06:41:34.430 --> 06:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan thank you uh
 
06:41:37.628 --> 06:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh I just wanted to uh say that
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
in my other life I live on the municipal
 
06:41:43.708 --> 06:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
and County government committee and want
 
06:41:45.910 --> 06:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
to alert the committee members that
 
06:41:49.948 --> 06:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
HB 453 is under consideration at this
 
06:41:53.830 --> 06:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
time and that along this same line of
 
06:41:57.548 --> 06:41:57.558 align:start position:0%
thought will be a discussion of
 
06:42:00.868 --> 06:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
restricting the use of snow and ice REM
 
06:42:03.990 --> 06:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
removal equipment to be used by
 
06:42:06.868 --> 06:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh governments and also
 
06:42:09.628 --> 06:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
individuals in their in their homes that
 
06:42:13.468 --> 06:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
they will no longer be able to uh use
 
06:42:16.708 --> 06:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
gasoline combustion Motors in order to
 
06:42:19.190 --> 06:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
remove snow and ice and what would have
 
06:42:21.910 --> 06:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
to revert to some type of an electrical
 
06:42:25.788 --> 06:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
device uh and the and the thought of uh
 
06:42:28.190 --> 06:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
of what that would do if if I'm thinking
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal the recapitalization of very
 
06:42:34.070 --> 06:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
expensive equipment for for towns that
 
06:42:36.310 --> 06:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
are already trying to control operating
 
06:42:40.430 --> 06:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
costs uh so it's something to to to
 
06:42:43.510 --> 06:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
understand that that that's in and about
 
06:42:47.670 --> 06:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
our process and our uh potential
 
06:42:49.750 --> 06:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for sharing that
 
06:42:51.910 --> 06:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan so your your point
 
06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
is that the the equipment issue purchase
 
06:43:01.388 --> 06:43:01.398 align:start position:0%
issue is being driven somewhat by uh one
 
06:43:03.990 --> 06:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
one side of the of the climate
 
06:43:05.628 --> 06:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
right issue is that and they're going to
 
06:43:08.388 --> 06:43:08.398 align:start position:0%
be real impacts uh financially both to
 
06:43:12.948 --> 06:43:12.958 align:start position:0%
homeowners and to uh Community uh
 
06:43:16.030 --> 06:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
government thank
 
06:43:19.070 --> 06:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
you uh go go ahead representative
 
06:43:21.430 --> 06:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
C I was just gonna say like it's not
 
06:43:23.430 --> 06:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
gonna pass that committee
 
06:43:25.590 --> 06:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
sorry but but it's not going to pass
 
06:43:27.670 --> 06:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
that committee I mean let's be honest
 
06:43:29.350 --> 06:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
just because somebody entered a bill
 
06:43:32.750 --> 06:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
they it's still due due diligence so I
 
06:43:35.788 --> 06:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
think that's a little point is mute here
 
06:43:38.948 --> 06:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
well I M if I may of gagy has his hand
 
06:43:42.708 --> 06:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:45.548 --> 06:43:45.558 align:start position:0%
ahead uh representative cyber you you
 
06:43:47.590 --> 06:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned due diligence this is what
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would do due diligence get all
 
06:43:52.110 --> 06:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
sides together put them in a room you
 
06:43:54.110 --> 06:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
have to I was a kickboxer you put
 
06:43:55.388 --> 06:43:55.398 align:start position:0%
somebody in a room and you settle
 
06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
something you settle one way or the
 
06:43:59.628 --> 06:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
other and and whoever whoever has the
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
better argument who has the better facts
 
06:44:05.468 --> 06:44:05.478 align:start position:0%
will win out and if the the the climate
 
06:44:09.030 --> 06:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
change Advocates say that we'll because
 
06:44:11.868 --> 06:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
of us we're we're losing this planet
 
06:44:14.230 --> 06:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
then if it's
 
06:44:16.990 --> 06:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
irrefutable uh
 
06:44:20.110 --> 06:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
facts I'm going to be on board but until
 
06:44:21.628 --> 06:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
that happens I want everybody to get
 
06:44:24.430 --> 06:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
together and figure it
 
06:44:27.628 --> 06:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
out rep uh just a quick response to that
 
06:44:29.830 --> 06:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
and then representative Lloyd the the
 
06:44:32.510 --> 06:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
intent of the measure which was my
 
06:44:35.788 --> 06:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
measure was to embrace and encourage
 
06:44:37.910 --> 06:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I know that some of the
 
06:44:41.590 --> 06:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
examples uh that I gave were certainly
 
06:44:43.868 --> 06:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
uh somewhat pointed but I think just
 
06:44:46.388 --> 06:44:46.398 align:start position:0%
during the subsequent testimony I could
 
06:44:47.830 --> 06:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
go on and on I think everyone who
 
06:44:50.708 --> 06:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
testified uh I learned from everyone who
 
06:44:55.030 --> 06:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
testified the the gentleman from Germany
 
06:44:57.070 --> 06:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh I thought was he was neutral on the
 
06:44:59.788 --> 06:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
measure but he I think uh provided some
 
06:45:02.030 --> 06:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
lessons that I I learned from and I
 
06:45:04.230 --> 06:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
think I hope that here and watching at
 
06:45:07.070 --> 06:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
home learn from so to your point that
 
06:45:09.628 --> 06:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
goes largely to some of the intent of
 
06:45:11.830 --> 06:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
the measure was to get a broad
 
06:45:15.070 --> 06:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
discussion that some of us feel is has
 
06:45:17.670 --> 06:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
been lacking because of concerns that
 
06:45:19.830 --> 06:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
some perspectives have have been U
 
06:45:21.230 --> 06:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
questioned I made the case for that
 
06:45:23.590 --> 06:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
earlier uh representive Lloyd go ahead
 
06:45:26.388 --> 06:45:26.398 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up thank you um and I
 
06:45:28.788 --> 06:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak on I understand the
 
06:45:32.230 --> 06:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
intent of this of this measure and I
 
06:45:35.830 --> 06:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with it um however I
 
06:45:37.788 --> 06:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
can't vote for it
 
06:45:40.388 --> 06:45:40.398 align:start position:0%
because I just don't know that it's
 
06:45:43.350 --> 06:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
necessary um given
 
06:45:46.548 --> 06:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
that Avenues are out there that present
 
06:45:49.270 --> 06:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
both sides um whether it be a conference
 
06:45:53.030 --> 06:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
or um research uh done by scientists
 
06:45:56.548 --> 06:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
online or um or anything like that and I
 
06:45:59.430 --> 06:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
think that on when it comes to
 
06:46:03.070 --> 06:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
legislation for us I I also agree with
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the piece of testimony that we
 
06:46:08.510 --> 06:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
received that said as legislators it is
 
06:46:11.110 --> 06:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
our due diligence to look at everything
 
06:46:13.468 --> 06:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
and that I mean I I usually come here
 
06:46:15.310 --> 06:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly and I do appreciate the
 
06:46:17.030 --> 06:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
folks who have been here because they
 
06:46:19.310 --> 06:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
have been willing to hear testimony and
 
06:46:22.350 --> 06:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
have learned a lot as as time goes on um
 
06:46:24.948 --> 06:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
but I just I don't know that this
 
06:46:27.190 --> 06:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
measure is necessarily the way forward
 
06:46:30.350 --> 06:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
with it thank you representative uh
 
06:46:34.190 --> 06:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Lane uh please
 
06:46:36.708 --> 06:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
um I just I feel like I'm I don't want
 
06:46:40.990 --> 06:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
to repeat too much but like others I
 
06:46:44.310 --> 06:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
really learned a lot from the testimony
 
06:46:48.190 --> 06:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
and and I also um come every time and
 
06:46:51.590 --> 06:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
listen I do listen and I do try to
 
06:46:55.030 --> 06:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
listen and I represent both both teams
 
06:46:58.190 --> 06:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
from my uh from my district and try and
 
06:47:01.070 --> 06:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
think about what is best for all of them
 
06:47:04.670 --> 06:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
when I make a decision I think my
 
06:47:07.628 --> 06:47:07.638 align:start position:0%
problem with this um piece of
 
06:47:10.948 --> 06:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
legislation is that it uses inflammatory
 
06:47:15.150 --> 06:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
language and it's um pointing fingers
 
06:47:18.070 --> 06:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
and I think if you truly want to build
 
06:47:20.350 --> 06:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
you know a something where we can all
 
06:47:23.910 --> 06:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
sit down and talk together and listen we
 
06:47:26.468 --> 06:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
need to avoid some of the inflammatory
 
06:47:29.310 --> 06:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
and finger pointing and I think that
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
there are both people on both teams that
 
06:47:33.468 --> 06:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
do that so I
 
06:47:36.270 --> 06:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
I could go for like the the the the
 
06:47:38.788 --> 06:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
sample that he gave out I I would vote
 
06:47:42.990 --> 06:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
for that um I just it's just
 
06:47:44.750 --> 06:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
inflammatory thank you representative
 
06:47:48.388 --> 06:47:48.398 align:start position:0%
Lane and as I earlier uh acknowledged I
 
06:47:50.350 --> 06:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
I think I use the term pointed some of
 
06:47:54.230 --> 06:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
the whereas points uh did reflect some
 
06:47:57.670 --> 06:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
passion and I think that the passion was
 
06:48:01.548 --> 06:48:01.558 align:start position:0%
prompted by like with any resolution uh
 
06:48:03.990 --> 06:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
any resolution is prompted by some
 
06:48:07.388 --> 06:48:07.398 align:start position:0%
emotion or some position or feeling that
 
06:48:09.868 --> 06:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
something needs to be said uh that's the
 
06:48:12.990 --> 06:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
definition of a resolution and uh I
 
06:48:14.350 --> 06:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
understand that the language was
 
06:48:17.910 --> 06:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
probably somewhat pointed uh as I said
 
06:48:20.590 --> 06:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
and I get that but I again would point
 
06:48:23.750 --> 06:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
out that uh I think an effective
 
06:48:26.190 --> 06:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
resolution maybe could have been worded
 
06:48:28.510 --> 06:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
differently we can all argue about that
 
06:48:31.590 --> 06:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
or discuss that but I don't want to
 
06:48:33.628 --> 06:48:33.638 align:start position:0%
Discount the passion behind any
 
06:48:36.468 --> 06:48:36.478 align:start position:0%
resolution that uh that comes forward
 
06:48:37.788 --> 06:48:37.798 align:start position:0%
whether to this committee or any other
 
06:48:41.230 --> 06:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
committee other hands representative uh
 
06:48:42.750 --> 06:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Belcher and then
 
06:48:42.760 --> 06:48:43.868 align:start position:0%
uh representative Belcher and then
representative

06:48:43.868 --> 06:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:48:47.510 --> 06:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you Mr chairman I will uh be
 
06:48:49.788 --> 06:48:49.798 align:start position:0%
supporting this resolution because of
 
06:48:51.548 --> 06:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
what I believe my own personal beliefs
 
06:48:53.150 --> 06:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
on the issue and my personal beliefs on
 
06:48:55.750 --> 06:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
the issue include the following the
 
06:49:00.830 --> 06:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
origin of the scare of extreme
 
06:49:02.750 --> 06:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
catastrophic anthropomorphic climate
 
06:49:04.910 --> 06:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
change in America originated in this
 
06:49:07.430 --> 06:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
country decades and decades ago as a
 
06:49:09.510 --> 06:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
Soviet active measure meant to get us to
 
06:49:12.990 --> 06:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
 our own economy when then the
 
06:49:15.788 --> 06:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
most obvious solution in the world
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
presented itself in the form of nuclear
 
06:49:23.070 --> 06:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
energy clean nuclear energy it was also
 
06:49:26.150 --> 06:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
go figure subject to Soviet active
 
06:49:28.590 --> 06:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
measures against it which is one of the
 
06:49:30.270 --> 06:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
reasons that you'll find even to this
 
06:49:33.830 --> 06:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
day many of the major names against
 
06:49:36.548 --> 06:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
or rather the alarmists the ones who are
 
06:49:38.948 --> 06:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
claiming catastrophic climate change are
 
06:49:42.990 --> 06:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
also remain against nuclear
 
06:49:45.708 --> 06:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
energy so my foremost concern on the
 
06:49:47.628 --> 06:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
matter is very simple we live in a cold
 
06:49:49.830 --> 06:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
climate we need energy so my
 
06:49:52.430 --> 06:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
constituents don't freeze to death in
 
06:49:56.468 --> 06:49:56.478 align:start position:0%
the dark while starving they need energy
 
06:50:00.990 --> 06:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
we need it for our standard of life and
 
06:50:03.948 --> 06:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
we have so tainted the conver ation over
 
06:50:06.150 --> 06:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
years and years of bad science that's
 
06:50:09.910 --> 06:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
been driven along the lines of well it's
 
06:50:11.590 --> 06:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
simple you don't get funded in the
 
06:50:13.628 --> 06:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
industry that is primarily government
 
06:50:16.110 --> 06:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
funded unless you're going to pursue a
 
06:50:18.868 --> 06:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
certain line of thought anything to the
 
06:50:20.868 --> 06:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
contrary tends to not get funded and
 
06:50:22.310 --> 06:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's well documented at this
 
06:50:24.270 --> 06:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
point in fact it ties in with the other
 
06:50:25.830 --> 06:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
stuff we've just been talking about us
 
06:50:28.708 --> 06:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
Aid and all this other stuff so yeah we
 
06:50:30.310 --> 06:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at the whole broad
 
06:50:32.910 --> 06:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
issue and see what is really going on
 
06:50:36.310 --> 06:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
and we need to stop passing so many
 
06:50:39.310 --> 06:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
economically harmful policies that are
 
06:50:42.070 --> 06:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
driving up our electricity rates that at
 
06:50:44.708 --> 06:50:44.718 align:start position:0%
this rate threaten to destabilize our
 
06:50:46.708 --> 06:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
Northeast grid you may or may not know
 
06:50:47.990 --> 06:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
this but there was at least two
 
06:50:50.110 --> 06:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
emergencies declared on our grid over
 
06:50:52.590 --> 06:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
the past year on days where we almost
 
06:50:54.070 --> 06:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough electricity to make
 
06:50:57.310 --> 06:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
it through almost had to have brownouts
 
06:50:59.150 --> 06:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at because we're
 
06:51:02.230 --> 06:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
demonizing the obvious the obvious
 
06:51:05.510 --> 06:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
answer which is nuclear energy thank you
 
06:51:06.868 --> 06:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Bel representative
 
06:51:08.750 --> 06:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
Dolan go ahead yes thank you Mr chair
 
06:51:11.830 --> 06:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
just to follow up uh the legislation
 
06:51:14.708 --> 06:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned about uh snow removal
 
06:51:17.310 --> 06:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
equipment the comment was that there's
 
06:51:19.270 --> 06:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
no way the committee would pass that I
 
06:51:21.830 --> 06:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
can tell you that this week in executive
 
06:51:25.110 --> 06:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
session the committee vote was N9 to9
 
06:51:28.948 --> 06:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
tie and it was voted to retain it so for
 
06:51:28.958 --> 06:51:30.868 align:start position:0%
tie and it was voted to retain it so for
further

06:51:30.868 --> 06:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:51:32.948 --> 06:51:32.958 align:start position:0%
considerations thank you for verifying
 
06:51:34.948 --> 06:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
that represent Don so the committee that
 
06:51:37.150 --> 06:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
this measure you described came to had a
 
06:51:39.788 --> 06:51:39.798 align:start position:0%
nine to9 vote on it right okay thank you
 
06:51:42.388 --> 06:51:42.398 align:start position:0%
for that anything
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
else uh I see two hands representative
 
06:51:46.030 --> 06:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
Bennett and then representative Manion
 
06:51:48.468 --> 06:51:48.478 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Bennett uh since
 
06:51:51.230 --> 06:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of new uh thank you for letting
 
06:51:54.948 --> 06:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
me speak um I don't know like all the
 
06:51:58.150 --> 06:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
like stuff that happens underneath or
 
06:52:00.388 --> 06:52:00.398 align:start position:0%
you know like you're mentioning there's
 
06:52:04.150 --> 06:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
some kind of tension or whatever ever um
 
06:52:06.230 --> 06:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think just based on what we heard
 
06:52:10.788 --> 06:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
today the ones who were talking about um
 
06:52:13.548 --> 06:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
the gentleman that had the new furnace
 
06:52:16.990 --> 06:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
and got a money from the government for
 
06:52:20.788 --> 06:52:20.798 align:start position:0%
a new car to have the green
 
06:52:24.430 --> 06:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
energy and though the people that were
 
06:52:26.948 --> 06:52:26.958 align:start position:0%
discussing that type of
 
06:52:29.350 --> 06:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
situation said they didn't agree with
 
06:52:30.750 --> 06:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
this because they didn't want to talk
 
06:52:33.548 --> 06:52:33.558 align:start position:0%
about it because the facts are the fact
 
06:52:38.110 --> 06:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
so I think that just that alone tells me
 
06:52:40.190 --> 06:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
that we need this because we need to
 
06:52:41.750 --> 06:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
06:52:44.310 --> 06:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
people understand
 
06:52:47.948 --> 06:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
that um you know there are two sides we
 
06:52:51.510 --> 06:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
heard two sides of the story and we all
 
06:52:55.230 --> 06:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
deserve the respect that we have our
 
06:52:58.230 --> 06:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
side of the story in my opinion if we
 
06:53:01.868 --> 06:53:01.878 align:start position:0%
our schools just got solar panels and
 
06:53:05.830 --> 06:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering ing you know over time if
 
06:53:07.948 --> 06:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
we had bought new furnaces and paid for
 
06:53:10.150 --> 06:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
oil and paid for electricity like
 
06:53:12.868 --> 06:53:12.878 align:start position:0%
normal at once those solar panels are
 
06:53:15.270 --> 06:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
done have we really saved money we
 
06:53:17.190 --> 06:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
aren't going to know for the next 20 to
 
06:53:20.990 --> 06:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
30 years we're just guessing so I think
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
all of these things need to be brought
 
06:53:24.948 --> 06:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
out in the open I think this just by
 
06:53:27.270 --> 06:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
what was demonstrated today that we do
 
06:53:27.280 --> 06:53:28.230 align:start position:0%
what was demonstrated today that we do
need

06:53:28.230 --> 06:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
need
 
06:53:30.430 --> 06:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you for that representative
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
Bennett representative Manion so I kept
 
06:53:34.230 --> 06:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
asking questions that were specifically
 
06:53:37.350 --> 06:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
about climate anxiety and children um
 
06:53:40.230 --> 06:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's you know that we have like an up
 
06:53:41.788 --> 06:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
an upand cominging um generation of
 
06:53:43.788 --> 06:53:43.798 align:start position:0%
children that are like much more anxious
 
06:53:45.468 --> 06:53:45.478 align:start position:0%
than previous generations and some
 
06:53:46.910 --> 06:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
attribute it to social media but I think
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's all kind of like one thing together
 
06:53:50.910 --> 06:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
and uh there was one of the experts was
 
06:53:52.430 --> 06:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
mentioning that like oh well they should
 
06:53:55.110 --> 06:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
be afraid it's like of what like this
 
06:53:56.628 --> 06:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
the world going to end in 10 years and
 
06:53:57.548 --> 06:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
it's like well it's not going to end in
 
06:53:59.110 --> 06:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
10 years like then why are we making
 
06:54:03.230 --> 06:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
these children terrified over a hyp
 
06:54:06.310 --> 06:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
phical sure and that is what you just
 
06:54:09.750 --> 06:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
said is what we've already gone over uh
 
06:54:11.070 --> 06:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard before and thank you for
 
06:54:13.510 --> 06:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
reiterating that anything else uh go
 
06:54:16.468 --> 06:54:16.478 align:start position:0%
ahead The Honorable representative from
 
06:54:18.910 --> 06:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
gtown thank you Mr chair one of the
 
06:54:20.310 --> 06:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
other reasons that I want this thing to
 
06:54:22.270 --> 06:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
be on the table and recognized is
 
06:54:23.830 --> 06:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
because you know we've heard reference
 
06:54:27.830 --> 06:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
to um government subsidies to all of the
 
06:54:29.628 --> 06:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
energy Industries to the fossil fuel
 
06:54:32.388 --> 06:54:32.398 align:start position:0%
industry the green energy industry and
 
06:54:34.430 --> 06:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
anytime you hear government subsidies I
 
06:54:37.548 --> 06:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
want you to take a step back and think
 
06:54:41.110 --> 06:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money that is taken under the
 
06:54:44.070 --> 06:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
threat of violence if you don't comply
 
06:54:45.670 --> 06:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
like that is somebody's money that was
 
06:54:47.150 --> 06:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
taken by the government that is now
 
06:54:49.548 --> 06:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
being distributed to manipulate the
 
06:54:51.468 --> 06:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
market in some way and if you can't have
 
06:54:53.150 --> 06:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
an honest conversation about every side
 
06:54:54.388 --> 06:54:54.398 align:start position:0%
of this issue then you can't have an
 
06:54:55.910 --> 06:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
honest conversation about how the tax
 
06:54:58.430 --> 06:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
dollars are being redistributed to
 
06:54:59.948 --> 06:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
influence the
 
06:55:02.750 --> 06:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
market thank you for that representative
 
06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins thank you Mr
 
06:55:07.948 --> 06:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
chair um earlier Mr Gage talked and I
 
06:55:09.590 --> 06:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
asked him the question what he what he
 
06:55:12.070 --> 06:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
how he Heats his how and and what he
 
06:55:14.350 --> 06:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
uses for a vehicle he's been in before I
 
06:55:15.750 --> 06:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
knew what his answers are going to be
 
06:55:18.150 --> 06:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
he's updated he's got an EV car now
 
06:55:20.628 --> 06:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
that's great but the his answer to the
 
06:55:24.590 --> 06:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
oil was this is all he can afford now I
 
06:55:26.110 --> 06:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
understand that completely that that's
 
06:55:28.310 --> 06:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
all he can afford but there's a lot of
 
06:55:31.510 --> 06:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
people less fortunate than what he is
 
06:55:33.948 --> 06:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
and how are they going to afford these
 
06:55:36.468 --> 06:55:36.478 align:start position:0%
new ways going with the green energy if
 
06:55:38.910 --> 06:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
we don't find the solutions and work
 
06:55:38.920 --> 06:55:40.510 align:start position:0%
we don't find the solutions and work
together

06:55:40.510 --> 06:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:55:42.990 --> 06:55:43.000 align:start position:0%

Jones Thank you Mr chair um I was truly
 
06:55:52.190 --> 06:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
intrigued when I saw the the title of
 
06:55:54.030 --> 06:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
this resolution I thought maybe it was
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
something I can work with but when I saw
 
06:55:58.788 --> 06:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
the text and it seemed to be very
 
06:56:01.030 --> 06:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
accusatory uh I thought it should be a
 
06:56:04.270 --> 06:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
little more impartial and uh a more
 
06:56:05.868 --> 06:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
impartial document that we could send to
 
06:56:08.388 --> 06:56:08.398 align:start position:0%
the full house so I'll be opposing
 
06:56:10.830 --> 06:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
