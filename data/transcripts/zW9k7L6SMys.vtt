00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone members of the ENA
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee and guess who are joining us
 
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
we are here for our final exec session
 
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative session and uh I want to
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all for coming
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
we've got uh seven bills that we have to
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
make recommendations on today so I don't
 
00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
believe this will take a long time but I
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate you all making the
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
trip here and joining us
 
00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.210 align:start position:0%
trip here and joining us
foreign

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
all right I think we are ready to just
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
get right into it any announcements
 
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 align:start position:0%
Peter that you have before we go
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh no I think that uh
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
the only thing that was going to be
 
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
happening that didn't was the uh tour of
 
00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 align:start position:0%
unh and we're going to try to do that
 
00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
early in next session so it's not sort
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
of an afterthought
 
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.689 align:start position:0%
of an afterthought
awesome

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
awesome
 
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 align:start position:0%
all right we're gonna open up House Bill
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
366 defining Animal Hoarding and I will
 
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
look to representative Bixby for a
 
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.469 align:start position:0%
look to representative Bixby for a
motion

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 align:start position:0%
I move that we do not recommend
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
366776 366 for further legislation do I
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
I'll second it representative come to us
 
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.710 align:start position:0%
I'll second it representative come to us
seconds

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
I will open it up for discussion and
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize representative Bixby
 
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor of the bill has
 
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
said that he does not feel that this
 
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 align:start position:0%
needs to go forward uh and uh
 
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
in our hearings on this we had several
 
00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start position:0%
hearings on this and we got more and
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
more information saying that this was a
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
very hard not to crack and that it
 
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
probably does not have a solution using
 
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
this pathway
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
well as Prime sponsor of the bill I
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
guess I will speak on it for a minute
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
but well said uh excuse me a little frog
 
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
in my throat today
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
no we you know we certainly felt I think
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
I speak for the committee we feel this
 
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
is an important topic but
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
we were not able to find what we felt
 
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 align:start position:0%
was a good solution to the problems that
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
we identified and you know as
 
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said to
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
seems like we were going to create more
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
problems than we were going to solve by
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
continuing on with it so I I'm glad we
 
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
had the conversation I certainly may
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
look at the bill in the future of you
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
know bringing it back or someone else
 
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
may because the topic is very important
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
but we'll uh at this time we as a
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
committee didn't just didn't have a
 
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
solution to it so we felt it was best
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
not to recommend it
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
 
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.710 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
chair

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
I think that bill was going in the right
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
direction I think we have a problem with
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
Admiral Animal Hoarding
 
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 align:start position:0%
um but uh too many problems unanswered
 
00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.350 align:start position:0%
um but uh too many problems unanswered
questions

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
um I think we ought to look at it for
 
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
the next term
 
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
well we can certainly do that if someone
 
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
wants to bring it back to life again
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
seeing none I will ask the clerk to call
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
a roll so just for clarification today
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
we're only going to there'll be one of
 
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
two recommendations either we recommend
 
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
it for future legislation or we do not
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
recommend it it's just a straight up and
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
down vote there's no amendments there's
 
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 align:start position:0%
no edits and there'll be one committee
 
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
report if there is a situation where we
 
00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
have a minority there's no Minority
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
Report it's just an a committee report
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
on the recommendation
 
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps understable so so the the motion
 
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
is not recommended for future
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is that right correct thank
 
00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.090 align:start position:0%
legislation is that right correct thank
you

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so just one other
 
00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259 align:start position:0%
note on that uh the whether we recommend
 
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 align:start position:0%
or do not recommend for future
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
legislation that does not bind a future
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
legislature in any way whatsoever so if
 
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
someone decides that they actually want
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
to pick up one of the things we Rec we
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
don't recommend uh that there's no
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.230 align:start position:0%
problem with that
foreign

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 align:start position:0%
all right I will ask the clerk to call
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
12-0 motion passes all right so we have
 
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:28.740 align:start position:0%
voted not to recommend Health Bill 366
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay next we will open up House Bill 438
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
relative to the confidentiality of
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
animal records databases and I will look
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
to representative Bixby for a motion
 
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
I recommend that we do not recommend for
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
made reference under the Bon polinski
 
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.370 align:start position:0%
made reference under the Bon polinski
seconds

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:57.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me I will recognize
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby to speak to his
 
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
motion so this was um a bill to add uh
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
or to make sure that there was security
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
added to the animal records database
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
which uh was passed in the
 
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.470 align:start position:0%
which uh was passed in the
um

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
budget uh last year and uh the basically
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
all of the recommendations for
 
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:27.300 align:start position:0%
um for security that were suggested in
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
this bill were included in the budget
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
version so I think that this is we have
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
it pretty much covered
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
any further comments
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative I somehow knew I was
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
going to be calling on let's see as I am
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
should say a few words so although the
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill that passed for the animal database
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
does include a lot of the safety and
 
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
privacy protocols I think it's inherent
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
upon this committee to make sure that
 
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.449 align:start position:0%
upon this committee to make sure that
those

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
are actually done and if we need to be I
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
will be bringing forth or ask someone to
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
bring forth legislation if needed to
 
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
ensure those privacies
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none we are voting on House Bill
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
438 relative to the confidentiality of
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
animal records databases with the motion
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
of we do not recommend future
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and I will ask the clerk to
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
yes representative Davis yes
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton yes represent
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%

representative dutse yes represent
 
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
Murray yes representative Von plitzki
 
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
Murray yes representative Von plitzki
yes

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair yes 12-0 motion passes all
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
right so we have
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
recommended House Bill 438 not
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation with
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
a vote of 12 to zero
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
next we will do House Bill 585 FN
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
allowing the prepayment of dog licenses
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for the duration of a
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
rabies vaccination and reducing fines
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
related there too and I will look to
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for a motion
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
I recommend that we I move that we
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
recommend not to have for the
 
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
recommend not to have for the
legislation

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
do we have a second
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Dusty seconds
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you're recognized
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion so uh the idea
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
was that because rabies shots last for
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
three years it might be possible to have
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
dog licenses last for that amount of
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
time and uh we got a very lukewarm
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
response at best from all of the city
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
and Municipal clerks all the municipal
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
clerks that we had approached about this
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh and what we don't want to do is make
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
more work for the municipal clerks so it
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
seems like this is probably best to just
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I know I have spoken with the prime
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor on this bill and uh you know
 
00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
they're while the concept is good they
 
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
recognize the concerns that were there
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
and they may look in the future to try
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
and address some of those concerns but
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
they were fine with the committee making
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
this recommendation now
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh I will ask the clerk to
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
call the roll on House Bill 585 with a
 
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
recommendation of not recommended for
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
okay so HP 585 FN not recommended
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative comtwa yes representative
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative mola yes
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
representative Mason yes representative
 
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:01.940 align:start position:0%
samboy represent Bixby yes
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Murray
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
yes represent Von plinski yes Mr chair
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes 12-0
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
all right with a world of twelve to zero
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
we have moved not recommended for a
 
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.910 align:start position:0%
we have moved not recommended for a
future

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:23.899 align:start position:0%
next we will do House Bill 627
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
establishing evaluated Grant matching
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
fund for New Hampshire agricultural
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
producers and I will look to
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for a motion I move
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
that we do not recommend for further
 
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.470 align:start position:0%
that we do not recommend for further
legislation

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby moves not
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation do I
 
00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
have a second representative come to our
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
seconds representative Bixby you're
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
recognized yeah so this is my bill and I
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
basically picked it up from a bill that
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh was held was an interim study
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
the previous term and I uh
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I didn't really know the subject
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
matter all as well as I might have and
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
uh when I got into looking at the the
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
details of it it looked like the
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh the numbers in it were just not
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
correct and the uh and the mechanism was
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
not correct and uh the the basic idea
 
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
was that people who are applying for
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
value-added Grants from USDA should have
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
some access to a little bit more
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
resources to help make that the match
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's necessary for that uh that's a
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
laudable goal but I don't think that
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill uh is something
 
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to work for making to to
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
achieve that goal so I think we you know
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
if if someone else somewhere wants to
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
come back with a bill that it aimed at
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
that goal that's fine but I think we
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
we're done with this one
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
I will ask the clerk to call the roll on
 
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 627 with a recommendation of
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
next we will do House Bill 1111
 
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study
 
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility so we
 
00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
had subcommittee meetings on this
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
particular Bill we actually did a study
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
on it and I'm going to call on
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray who chaired the
 
00:15:59.329 --> 00:15:59.339 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to bring the results from
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
that committee and and I want to thank
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
you for sharing that committee this year
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
I know that you had a few bills that
 
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
were put through there and I want to
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and all all of the committee
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
members that served on that subcommittee
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
I think you all did a great job
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes so to to briefly just
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
um if I may
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee met twice the first
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
was an informal listening session where
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
we heard from various stakeholders and
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
that came forward we heard from uh Des
 
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
who uh still
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
um suggests in their Solid Waste plan
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
that they do they would like to see
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
integrated into some of the things that
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
they see within their in in the
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
department of environmental science or
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
Services excuse me as well as the
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
listening session revealed a widespread
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
desire to continue working on the
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
pressures that our waste streams have at
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
varying levels of the government whether
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
it was Municipal
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and local levels or at the state
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
level we also saw uh continue to hear
 
00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.930 align:start position:0%
level we also saw uh continue to hear
about

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
um increases in tipping fees that were
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
creating pressures on municipalities
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
since 2019
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
those have continually increased and it
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
was also noted that we still have no
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
materials recovery facility or Murph in
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and so with
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
that there was some discussion about the
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
expediency with which committees can
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
move versus commissions and we heard
 
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
some testimony and thoughts around that
 
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.090 align:start position:0%
some testimony and thoughts around that
and

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
um then in our
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
work session the following week we
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
continue to have that discussion about
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
how we felt that that made work to our
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
advantage to have a committee doing the
 
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
work versus a commission so with that
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
there was a unanimous agreement that it
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
should move forward for future
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
legislation perhaps with a a study
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
committee looking at extended producer
 
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
responsibility with a lens towards 149 m
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
all right so we have a recommendation
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee representative
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
Bixby would you like to comment yeah um
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
another aspect of this is that extended
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility is a fairly
 
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
complicated complicated undertaking and
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
requires aligning multiple stakeholders
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
and it's uh sufficiently complicated
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
that just doing a bill right now to do
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
it is probably not going to get the kind
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
of results that we want whereas a study
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
committee can pull in various
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and help figure out a way
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
that is agreeable to
 
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
um to the entire stakeholder population
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
to go forward with it
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative Murray did you actually
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
move the bill for
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
her uh
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
okay sorry I I missed it when you said
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
that so do I have a second on that
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
make sure I get my process in order
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative verbal thank you Mr
 
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.789 align:start position:0%
yes representative verbal thank you Mr
chairman

00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:17.870 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
the challenge that I have with this is
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
we have an ever-growing Patchwork of
 
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility laws
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
state by state uh across this country
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
and that Patchwork of of laws is
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
creating a very large burden on a lot of
 
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:39.140 align:start position:0%
companies that now have to track and and
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
participate in these programs state by
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
state this is an issue in my opinion
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
that really should be delegated up to
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
the federal level what we need if if we
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
need as a nation an extended producer
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh type of program it
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
should be a federal one so that it's
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
uniform from coast to coast right now
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
you you have companies that are
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
supplying into two to 50 states and now
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
having to comply with this Patchwork of
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislation and it's for that reason
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
that I will not vote in favor to
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
recommend a commission to to study Erp
 
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
the chair we are not recommending a
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
commission we're only recommending a
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
study committee to study a very narrow
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
and I do understand what you're saying
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor was also okay with us
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
changing it from a commission to a study
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee so that in our in the ENA
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
whoever's on that committee next year
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
can really do a deep dive and then
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
possibly recommend to the federal
 
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.409 align:start position:0%
possibly recommend to the federal
delegation

00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative yeah thank you
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Cromwell I I did misspeak
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize for that I do know
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's a committee and I I appreciate the
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
the correction
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
um but it it doesn't change my My
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
overall position but thank you thank you
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
add that um I had concerns as well this
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
was something that we discussed I do
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
feel like that we have the framework
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
that we need already in which to look at
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
this issue and study it if we wanted to
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
if it's as it's
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
um was communicated to us a priority
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
then we already have those structures
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
that can do that through subcommittees
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
so I had some issues with recommending
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
that on its own the one thing that
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
um that I appreciated though is rep
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
comptwa came up with the solution of
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
really looking at this isn't so much a
 
00:21:48.529 --> 00:21:48.539 align:start position:0%
standalone for uh extended extended
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as much as it's to see
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
how that fits in with current RSA 149
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the waste reduction goals so because
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
it's within that vein that I felt
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving forward but I do feel
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
like we already have enough venues in
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
which to discuss this topic thank you
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I hear well uh
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative verville's concern
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
relative to the heavy load put on by any
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
number of states on producers and that's
 
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:30.500 align:start position:0%
a cost factor and that gets passed on to
 
00:22:33.289 --> 00:22:33.299 align:start position:0%
the consumer and the products
 
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:36.140 align:start position:0%
however because
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
this bill is narrow focus on a study
 
00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:42.419 align:start position:0%
committee I think it deserves at least
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
some further consideration
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
whether it goes one way or the other not
 
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
to Prejudice it but I think the
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
committee might be useful to either
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
perfect it or put it to sleep once and
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative dutzie yes thank you I'm
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
chairman I just need some clarification
 
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
because the the bill was to establish a
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
commission okay and there's no
 
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:11.900 align:start position:0%
amendments that we that are allowed here
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
so does the study committee
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation override what's actually
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
in this bill and so we are voting for a
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
study committee and not a commission
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
when you want to take uh representative
 
00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:27.059 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
um this was clarified by
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
um by our our committee researcher and
 
00:23:33.059 --> 00:23:34.130 align:start position:0%
um by our our committee researcher and
also

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
um uh by sort of a second by uh sort of
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
by second boy you know one step and
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
removed also by the uh clerk that when
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
one is recommending for future
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
legislation one is essentially
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
recommending the idea rather than the
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'd like to just speak to
 
00:24:00.649 --> 00:24:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh representative verbal I appreciate
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
your um your thoughts on the issue and
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I would like
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
to say is that we definitely recognize
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
um between states there are unique
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
differences in how whether it's product
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
stewardship or extended producer
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility are put together between
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
states and that is that is in part part
 
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
of the reason why we think that future
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
study is recommended to some degree so I
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
do appreciate your um your thoughts
 
00:24:29.409 --> 00:24:29.419 align:start position:0%
around the the matter and I really am
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
grateful for the conversation that we've
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
had around this I think we worked as a
 
00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
subcommittee extremely hard to come to a
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
I just want a note for the record there
 
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
was an error in the bill actually it
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
actually listed as both a study
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
committee and then a commission as well
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
so in the bill itself we discarded an
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
error that the um Bill sponsor was not
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
aware of and so the bill technically
 
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
says both
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bixby
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
so uh one of the things that we learned
 
00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh soil conditioner study
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee was that there is actually a
 
00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:11.900 align:start position:0%
National Organization that
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
provides model legislation for all
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
um for all states on the definitions and
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
practices for use with fertilizer so uh
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
and this is this is a
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
um this is a non-governmental
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
organization that does this so it is
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
possible to achieve uh goals across
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
states without having it to be done by
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
the federal level one of the things that
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
I think that we would that the study
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
committee would need to look into is
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
what Avenues are there out there in the
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the private world that uh could help
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
move forward epr and make that regular
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
across uh all across all states so that
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh states are referring to one body of
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
ideas and that is something that would
 
00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:04.510 align:start position:0%
ideas and that is something that would
probably

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to come forward from the industry
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
and we one of the one reason to study is
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what's out there
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
in terms of that yet or whether there
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
are things that are being developed and
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
 
00:26:18.779 --> 00:26:20.330 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
studied

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
studied
 
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative burrville thank you Mr
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
Bixby I
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
I agree with you on what you just said
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
the disconnect is what what you're
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
suggesting in my opinion is more
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
appropriately handled at the federal
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
level to talk to Industries about
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
National standards for both product
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
stewardship and extended producer
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility because right now what we
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
have is this Patchwork of states that
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
are defining things differently they're
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
including things that other states
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
aren't other states are including things
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
some states aren't and even when you get
 
00:26:56.529 --> 00:26:56.539 align:start position:0%
a quote unquote National recommendation
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
once it comes down to the state level
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's up to the state to decide what they
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
want to do and every state likes to have
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
a unique solution that they believe best
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
suits the needs of of their citizens
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
their communities in their states and
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's how we wind up with with
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
patchworks that then Industries have to
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
comply with another example is that
 
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of States Maine being
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
the most recent which has passed
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislation relative to the inclusion of
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
pfas inside of products
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
so that we're talking about chemically
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
bound things so is it is it found in in
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
Plastics right is it an additive to
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
Plastics is an added to that not not not
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
free roaming pfas like we've had issues
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
with um in Southern New Hampshire and
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
other locations right so so now
 
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
industry is getting flooded with emails
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
do the products that you make do the
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
products that you supply
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
conform to the main state law Maine is
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
not the only one doing this these Erp
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
programs are the same thing they are but
 
00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
it's a different topic it's not specific
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
to people's but it becomes the same
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
thing it these things become onerous and
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
burdensome when they become state by
 
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.690 align:start position:0%
burdensome when they become state by
state

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340 align:start position:0%
that's why I can't support it because it
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
should be kicked up in my opinion to the
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
federal level so that we have a National
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
Standard thank you Mr Speaker all right
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman hey I don't want that job no
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
I know that's not the one you're loving
 
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.169 align:start position:0%
I know that's not the one you're loving
for

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative control thank you Mr
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
verville for your concerns
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
sit on another study committee where we
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
were looking at the Disposable flushable
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
wipes and labeling laws and in that
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
um our final report we're supposed to
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
meet Friday but our final report is to
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
send information to the federal
 
00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
legislation and say this is must should
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
be done at the federal level so
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
a study committee can actually formulate
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
that and and send it to the federal
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
delegation and get it to people to make
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
them aware uh because like you said on
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
that particular issue that we're
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
discovering there's all these different
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
laws in all these different states and
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you and I appreciate
 
00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
your comments
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.889 align:start position:0%
any further
discussion

00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:27.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
sometimes

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
we have these issues which are complex
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
and intricate and they need several
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
terms or several iterations to sort out
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
and develop a body and knowledge
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I think this is one of them
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
especially with representative Orville's
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
good point about pfas and products and
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
that's a hot button issue of much
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
concern now
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
we have office of legislative services
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
that could be very helpful and
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
instrumental and to the study committee
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
on this however it goes but to develop
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
the information a bit further for a
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
better decision even if this is only
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
step three out of four or five so I'm in
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
support of the rfl thank you any further
 
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:20.389 align:start position:0%
support of the rfl thank you any further
discussion

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
seeing none I think I'll wrap it up with
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
just saying this is the one thing that I
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate about this committee is we
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
can sit and have a very respectful and
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
thoughtful conversation with everyone
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
presenting you know their opinions and
 
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I just very much appreciate it I've
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
been very fortunate to chair this
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
committee and you all are great
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion we have on the table
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1111 is to recommend it
 
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
for future legislation so I'm going to
 
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
call on the uh calling the clerk to call

I move that we do not recommend this
 
00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:47.179 align:start position:0%
bill for further legislation
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby moves we do not
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
recommend it for future legislation do I
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.330 align:start position:0%
have a second
representative

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140 align:start position:0%
I will call on representative Bixby to
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion this bill would have
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
required a substantial bond for on for
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
any new uh landfill construction and the
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of doing that Bond were not
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
very clear uh the amount of the bond how
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
that was determined was not very clear
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
and whether this would have actually
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
achieved the goal of making sure that
 
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.149 align:start position:0%
achieved the goal of making sure that
um

00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
that Latin that a new landfill owner
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
would not have wouldn't uh be fully
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
capable of cleaning up any mess that
 
00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:41.299 align:start position:0%
happened was also not clear uh this is
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
probably not the right mechanism for
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
getting at the goal
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
um and uh so that uh
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
the uh this is so I it
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
is not a good way to continue forward
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.669 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
motion to not recommend for future
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
legislation on House Bill 1121 and I
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
will ask the clerk to call the roll
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
1652 relative to the recycling of
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
Beverage containers and I will look to
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for a motion uh I
 
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
reck I move that we recommend not to con
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh consider not to recommend further
 
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.769 align:start position:0%
uh consider not to recommend further
legislation

00:34:06.769 --> 00:34:06.779 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby moves not to
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation do we have
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
a second representative come to us
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
seconds representative Bixby would you
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes so this
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh is was essentially an attempt to
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
graft a bottle bill from I believe Rhode
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
Island onto New Hampshire law and it was
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms of it were extremely
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
complex and uh it did not uh
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not you believe in Bottle
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
bills in general this was nowhere near
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it and uh the
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
um the sense that I heard was that
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
um it probably if we are if we want to
 
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:53.780 align:start position:0%
encourage beverage container recycling
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh further than uh that's something that
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be best done with more
 
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
um industry involvement in designing a
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
plan for recovering beverage containers
 
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
which would fit under the rubric of epr
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
and we're having a study committee for
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
that uh or we're recommending a study
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee for that so
 
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.310 align:start position:0%
committee for that so
um

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
so going ahead with this as a standalone
 
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
Bill probably doesn't make sense
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:28.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
we are we have a motion to not recommend
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
for future legislation on House Bill
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
1652 and I will ask the clerk to call
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:42.180 align:start position:0%

other chair that there may be some
 
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:37.330 align:start position:0%
disagreement but uh I know I'm right
 
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.770 align:start position:0%
disagreement but uh I know I'm right
[Laughter]

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yes I'd like to
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank chairman Pearl for his leadership
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
over the last two years uh one of the
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
things that I have appreciated in my
 
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:52.140 align:start position:0%
tenure on this committee and I think I'm
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually the longest standing person of
 
00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
the committee is a real commitment to
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan work on the issues of the
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee and I think that chairman
 
00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
Pearl has been really exemplary in
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:40.069 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say I mean I think
the

00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
experienced on this committee really
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
comes from the leadership and I
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that representative
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
Bixby and representative Pearl have been
 
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:57.540 align:start position:0%
able to work together and work out a lot
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
of these things so that for members at
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
least in our caucus we really feel that
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
when when we're discussing bills that
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
the leadership has really thought about
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
it done their homework and brought
 
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
um some structure and Leadership to us
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
for us to think about and so it really
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
does start at the top and I really
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate the leadership from both the
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
ranking member and the chair of this
 
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.470 align:start position:0%
ranking member and the chair of this

well I wanna I wanna Echo that same
 
00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
sentiment because uh representative
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
Bixby has been a pleasure to work with
 
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
and you all have you know we've done a I
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
believe we've done really good work here
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
in our committee while we may not have
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
always agreed I think in the end we've
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
always put out very thoughtful uh
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the house floor and
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
and I always appreciated the very
 
00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.569 align:start position:0%
and I always appreciated the very
thoughtful

00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
thoughtful
 
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
um committee reports that all of you
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
drafted I had very little edits that I
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
ever had to do and I can tell you from
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
talking with some of my other chairs
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
that was not the case in every committee
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that you made my job
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
look very easy and uh and uh it's just
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
it is appreciated
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna let you all go with only one
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
one thing I ask maybe is that we could
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
all get together and just do a quick
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
picture if we could have someone before
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
back here next year as all of you or
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
most of you probably know I'm I'm not
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
running for the house again I'm looking
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
to run for receipt in the Senate
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
if I get there I'll look forward to
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
working with all of you that are back
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
and for those of you who aren't coming
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
back I'm not sure exactly where
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
everybody is we appreciate your service
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
and look forward to another great
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
session and
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
23 and 24 and it'll keep up the good
 
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:43.980 align:start position:0%
work if I am successful in getting on
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate side please know my door is
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
always open to all of you and I mean
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
that both sides of the aisle it's uh the
 
00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
conversations and the relationships that
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have made in this committee are
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
invaluable to me and I look forward to
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
having those in the future so
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the
 
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:01.460 align:start position:0%
committee I believe we can actually
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
adjourn can't we since this is our last
 
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
act we typically can't but I'm going to
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
adjourn the session for the environment
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
and agricultural committee for the for
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
