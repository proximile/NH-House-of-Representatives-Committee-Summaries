00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead we have with us proost uh
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
Jones excellent thank you very much
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative lad and and thanks for
 
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
inviting us here today to to provide you
 
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240 align:start position:0%
an update the two-page document in front
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
of you is is a summary of the work that
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
we did in our first year and what I'd
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
like to do today is walk through that as
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
well as let you know kind of what's
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
happened this fall and where I think uh
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
we will be by the by the end of December
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
is is the goal so hb1 1530 is really
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
centered on addressing this problem of
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh community college students having
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
very clear pathway Pathways that can be
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
communicated to students in high school
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
so that they see both a lower cost path
 
00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
if they want to use the Community
 
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
College on their way to uh usnh and a
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree uh but also many
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
students in fact I was I was just at at
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
an association of public and land grant
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
universities for the last couple days I
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
just got back last night and went to an
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
entire session where this is being
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussed across the country that about
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
65 % of the community college students
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know what path they
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
want to be on so they need to have
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
better guidance when they get into the
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
community college so how do we give them
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
that guidance and then the third thing
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
that I think is equally important is to
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have a map a map of
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
where are those degree opportunities and
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
how do they line up with the workforce
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
needs of the state um so three
 
00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
committees came excuse me just for a
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
second I was negligent Mark do you want
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
to come up and and be here at the same
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
time because this is all it's it's a
 
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:31.480 align:start position:0%
collect effort of both twoe and fouryear
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
system and I apologize for leaving the
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
visual um to that point the first thing
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
we did when HB hb1 1530 was passed was
 
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
we pulled together a team a team led by
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh lesie barber in the Chancellor's
 
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
office at ccsnh and Kate zemer uh who is
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
uh the senior Vice proost for academic
 
00:11:00.629 --> 00:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
Affairs at Una representing the usnh
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
system um those two working with faculty
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
and staff across both systems created
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
three committees the three committees
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
were really looking to explore um what
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
transfer programs were going to be most
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to pursue many many of those
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
programs are very very appropriate to
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
transfer kind of nursing to nursing very
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
straightforward um though there are some
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
complications I'll discuss others uh for
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
example if you're going for um auto
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
mechanics or large equipment operation
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
that exists at ccsnh there is no
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
parallel for a bachelor's degree um and
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
then the third area was to explore
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
existing Pathways as a definition I
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
would say there are two different ways
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
of looking at Pathways one approach to
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
Pathways is to think about it as very
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
very linear so you start out with an
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
accounting major at the community
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
college system that transfers course by
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
course by course through to a bachelor's
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
degree at one of the usn campuses those
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
Pathways have existed for years between
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
our two systems um but they're they're
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
one by one by one so we have seven
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
different community college campuses we
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
have three different usnh campuses
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
that's three times seven 21 different M
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
us that have to be signed for every
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
degree path it's not realistic another
 
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
pathway approach is to have a universal
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
pathway and that's been our Target in
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
the work that we've been doing on
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
1530 the second area which is also very
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
very interested is a block grant and the
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
block grant takes two forms so the so
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
imagine that when you get your
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
associates degree from ccsnh that
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
automatically transfers Lock Stock and
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
Barrel into a degree path in one of the
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
usnh institutions again there's two
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
flavors of that one is that it is the
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
entire major the other is that it is
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
just the general education requirements
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
which is fulfilled for the most part in
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
the first two years so it's it's very
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
very reasonable of those four Pathways
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
the middle two is where we're focusing
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
our energy and in particular the
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
universal Pathways so the idea that if
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
you come in and you know you want to
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
study nursing that there is a very clear
 
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
pathway all the way through what you'll
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
see on the second page of the report so
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
that would be this list uh not
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
highlighted in yellow but if you look
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
carefully you can almost see um this
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
list represents our Target Pathways It
 
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:25.160 align:start position:0%
lines up very very well with the
 
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
workforce needs in the state at this
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
time we have completed Universal
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
Pathways for 10 of those programs uh and
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the electronic version of this show you
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
which 10 I can actually yeah that' be
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
nice if we could have that you we could
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
check them all yeah so I will tell you
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read them off to you so
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
nursing yeah business management
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
psychology Human Services business
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
administration accounting and finance
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Management Information
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
Technology English and history those are
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
the ones that were completed as of the
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
time of the writing of this report I
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
will tell you we have seven more that we
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
believe are going to be completed by the
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
end of December and we are well on track
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
to complete all of them within the two
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
years of the hb1 1530 Bill and we'll be
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
updating you as we go do you have a list
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
of those seven that you're are those
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
still I do not have that with me
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
confidential uh it's not that they're
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
confidential it's that I just don't have
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
the data in front of me uh it's
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
certainly welln
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh lesie Barber and Kate
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
Zer were not able to be with us today so
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mark and I are poor second choices uh
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
to try and address your questions but I
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
can get that to you and will uh at the
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
end of December as soon as I I have that
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
list um we have run into some bumps many
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
of those bumps are centered on faculty
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
and and we're working through them one
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
at a time the community college system
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
you want to say something about the you
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
know pulling your faculty together in
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
the summer and the work that they did
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
there Mark I think uh that's a good
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
model and something we want to plug into
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah again the last couple of Summers
 
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.470 align:start position:0%
yeah again the last couple of Summers
we've

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
used last couple of Summers we've
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
engaged our faculty uh disciplinary
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
teams from across the seven colleges to
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
take a look at our curriculum identify
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
those courses that are equivalent try
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
and remove what are sometimes
 
00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies or or barriers within
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
our system so that we can identify
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
courses that are are comparable and and
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
should flow through both our system into
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
the university system
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
seamlessly um so we're actually trying
 
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
to build on that model one of the things
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
that started right before hb1 1530 but
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
hb1 1530 really put a bow on it was we
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to have better collaboration
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
between our campuses so uh working with
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh Kristen Miller at um White Mountain
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
White Mountains Community College uh
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
We've now pulled together a provos
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
council that is the provos of all of the
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
system campuses both the seven ccsn and
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
the three usnh and to be clear on the
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
usnh system they're called tros and vice
 
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
president for academic Affairs at the
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
community college they're all the vice
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
president for academic Affairs sometimes
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
with student affairs uh linked in there
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
we're now meeting every other month on
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
this topic and we're talking about how
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
do we get faculty together in the summer
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
this coming summer to Leverage What the
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
community college has been doing and get
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
some faculty from usnh there I'm very
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
excited about that I think the the
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
trickiest spot that we've run into is
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
how do we get the faculty more familiar
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
with one another because the block grant
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
requires more of that familiarity um
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
we've also been working on the transfer
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
Pathways and there's some technology
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we need to put in place to make it
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
more effective so there's um some
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
transfer softway I think we I'm going to
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
walk into the second part of this when I
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
talk about transfer Pathways so I'm not
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
sure I want to tell you everything on
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
that front now or we'll walk through
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
that separately um I will say we're very
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
excited about the work uh we know that
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
the total number of students
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
transferring from the community college
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
into the four-year college has declined
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
but we were very excited at the last
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
usnh uh uh Board of Trustees meeting we
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
were looking at the data and we realized
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
that actually the CC the usnh market
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
share of the ccsnh graduates has gone up
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit in recent years and we want
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
to keep increasing that that's the goal
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
pursue I'll stop there and see if
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
there's any questions on that part
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
before we talk about some of the other
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
trans transfer pathway work yes
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I'm just sort of
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
interested in these Majors that you had
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
us check off are they first in line
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
because of enrollment and interest of
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
the student body that's my first
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
question and then second is I see
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Elementary Ed next to social studies but
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm curious where uh future teachers are
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the priority list for your Pathways
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you both are great questions uh
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes the first thing we did
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
was we mapped all of the community
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
college majors and we mapped all of the
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
majors that they go into when they go to
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
usnh uh so part of that Target list
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
comes from that because we wanted to we
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
didn't want to spend an enormous amount
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
of time going after Majors that didn't
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
have a clear connection and there
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
weren't a lot of students in there so
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's why um in fact if you go if you
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
go three slides into the transfer
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
pathway there's a chart that shows
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh the enrollment chart that
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
we looked at that has nursing at the
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
top business management psychology those
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
are the three largest enrolled Majors
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
ccsnh there are some opportunities to
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
pursue some of these degrees that go
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
more specifically into Elementary and
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
secondary Ed um we now have a task force
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
that was pulled together by the provos
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
at usnh to explore kind of all those
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
path Pathways and the next step is to
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
take that to the ccsnh partnership um we
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
have some work to do there uh we
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
literally met with commissioner Ed blue
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
and um several members of his staff uh
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
late October was when we did that I
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't remember the exact date and uh the
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
23rd thank you Kathy and uh they were
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
very enthusiastic about us uh pulling
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
that group together and we reported on
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
that on November 7th when we met with
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
the uh Community College vice presidents
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and so there was lots of enthusias
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
often times with
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
education there are many other Majors
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
that take you into education education
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
is the certification it's the top off
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
right so you come in as a math major you
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
come in as a as a social science or a
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
history major and then you get your
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
Education certification on top anything
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
you want to share on the education side
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
from the community college
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
side I I I have a question for you and
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's on the second page of
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
our minutes and I have a copy here you
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
don't have it there because didn't get
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
copied upstairs
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to read this this
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph right here it followed uh when
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
we were discussing this you were giving
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
us a background on on education from
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
World War II onwards and but I'll read
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
this the university uh New Hampshire
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
system un nsnh
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
University New Hampshire system it must
 
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
be and Community College system New
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also provided a verbal update
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
regarding the status and progress of HB
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
1530 established curricular transfer
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
Pathways between the community college
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire and the
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
university system of New
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire progress is being made toward
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
this end an updated report will be made
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
with the community college system of New
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the and the university
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire in June committee
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
members did ask and here's one of the
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions which we asked who decides if
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
course credit is accepted from one one
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
institution to another Wayne Jones
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
responded that is it is the Department's
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
and staff within the department that
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
make the decision the committee
 
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
indicated concern should an accredited
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
course earned at one institution
 
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
institution be accepted at another
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
members Express this scenario has been a
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
concern for years and I believe the
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
senator does not here was one to ask
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
this and with full implementation of HB
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
1530 students may have a better
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
understanding of credit
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
transferability especially within the
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
and University system New Hampshire
 
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.750 align:start position:0%
and University system New Hampshire
Institution

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
further discussion will occur upon
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
receipt of the written status report
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
which we're receiving right now so the
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
question is that we are alluding to is
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
that if you're taking a math course with
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
you and you're accredited and it's an
 
00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.190 align:start position:0%
you and you're accredited and it's an
accredited

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
accredited
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
course why then if it's if the
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
accrediting is being done by the same
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
institution down in Boston or wherever
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
why is that not accepted at your level
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
or yeah at your level you mind if I take
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
a go with this yeah so this has been the
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
process we've been going through with
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
our faculty you would normally think for
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
instance first year composition uh
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
College um algebra for instance and pick
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
your course is a relatively standard
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
each course has specific learning
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes and what we've been asking our
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
faculty to do across the college is
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
confirm that the learning outcomes for
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
each of these courses are in fact the
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
same learning outcomes that the courses
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
aren't simply similar or comparable in
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
name but actually are achieving the same
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
result in some disciplines that may be
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
less uh clearcut than others but for
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
instance if you're looking at a sequence
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
of math courses without having assurance
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
that the core competencies in this
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
course are the foundation for the course
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
that follows you don't want to set a
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
student up for failure so what we're
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
asking our faculty to do in this process
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
is ensure the learning outcomes for the
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
courses are in fact the same learning
 
00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.390 align:start position:0%
courses are in fact the same learning
outcomes

00:22:59.390 --> 00:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
without that background work being done
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
by The Faculty you could find yourself
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
in a circumstance where the course
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
really isn't comparable and the students
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
preparation for what follows is
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
insufficient if I could if I could just
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
pile on one thing an important point of
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge is there's different
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
accreditations so when we talk about the
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
New England Commission on higher
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
education Nei that is our primary
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
accrediting body they accredit on behalf
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education but they
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
don't look course by course they look
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
for do you have the learning outcomes
 
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
defined they don't compare them they
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
just say do you have them defined and
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
they look for continuous Improvement how
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
are you getting how are you getting
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
feedback that is continuously letting
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
you improve your courses improve your
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum some Majors have separate
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
accreditation that that we hold that
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
requires that digs deeper digs into the
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
course level the text level what exactly
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
is is is the student reading and doing
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
and we have to meet those for example in
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
business we are aacp accredited that's a
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
top accrediting body and they don't even
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
accredit at the community college level
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
so there's a there's a gap there that's
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
where we need the faculty to do exactly
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
what Mark described we're challenging
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
our faculty to do the same as his and
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
we're asking them to talk to one another
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
so that we make sure they're lining up
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
wherever possible I I will say that the
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
heart of that question is is Central to
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of our conversations we're trying
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
to remove barriers for students h B 1530
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
gives us a framework to pursue that but
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
our accredit our accreditation through
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
Nei still requires that faculty have
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
control over the curriculum if you will
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
authority to determine that the learning
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
outcomes of this course brought in from
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
another institution in fact satisfy the
 
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
requirements of their
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
programs Prof SM you had a question yeah
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
I have uh five area questions you just
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
returned from a national meeting how
 
00:25:02.389 --> 00:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
many states have a similar program that
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
what we have here as far as the metric
 
00:25:07.389 --> 00:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
automatic matriculation into schools
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
from community
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
colleges I can't give you specific
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
statistics uh some uh systems are
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
combined uh for example the Sunni system
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
is a system I'm very familiar with the
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
community college is part of the same
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
system others are separated just like
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
ours are others have multiple State
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
systems so North Carolina there's
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's the state system there's a UNCC
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
system and then there's the community
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
college system so there's mixes um all
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
of them right now are talking about how
 
00:25:40.389 --> 00:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
do we build these types of Pathways and
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
these types of block transfers
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
uh I would based on my discussions less
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
than certainly less than half probably
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
less than a the third actually have them
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
already built so it would be fair to say
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is somewhat ahead of
 
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.710 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is somewhat ahead of
the

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
the head of the curve as it relates to
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I go that it's a steep
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
curve um I I would look at States like
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
California Virginia and Florida that are
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
probably decades ahead of us on some of
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
these things yeah and they tend to have
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
very wellestablished uh systems with you
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
know in some cases common course
 
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
numbering that flows between the
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
community college system University
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
system so the student knows that it's
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
not only this course by name but by
 
00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
number course lives at every
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
institution next question is how are
 
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.950 align:start position:0%
institution next question is how are
students

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
notified of this particular opportunity
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
for them to do this automatic
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
matriculation uh so after they achieve
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
their associate degree so what's the
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
process of making sure that they're
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
aware that and do they and when do they
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
give notice that they want to do
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
that well we we use this as an advising
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
tool with students when they come on
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
board that if you're interested in a
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
four-year degree through the university
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
system this is the pathway for this
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
program so it's part of the advising in
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
fact it's part of the recruiting
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity when prospective students
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
are considering that the community colle
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
system what one of the things that is
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
being discussed right now as part of our
 
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
working groups is how do we do that
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
communication better how do we get it to
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
start in high school so that high school
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
students know that this is an option um
 
00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039 align:start position:0%
but we also very much need to have the
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
partnership of the advisers at the
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
community colleges because so many
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
students 65% of students are going to
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
change their mind and change their path
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
while they're in courses at the
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
community college so it's kind of an
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
ongoing thing that we have to support I
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
I would submit that uh even at the high
 
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
school level of counseling there as far
 
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
as where students might want to go
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
that's another opportunity to at least
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
because there may be some students say
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
no I I don't want I'm not a I'll get my
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
associate degree because I want want to
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
get a particular badge or a particular
 
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.350 align:start position:0%
get a particular badge or a particular
uh

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
certification and the counselor at the
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
high school I would say look at here's
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
another opportunity for you to do that
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
plus go ahead I'm not here for a sales
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
call today but I'm going to use the
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity this is at the heart of our
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
interest in expanding duel and
 
00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment early early
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
college program if we can assist
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
students and families in
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
seeing both the benefit of opport and
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
affordability while they're still in
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
high school not just to take courses
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
randomly but to take a structured entry
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
into these Pathways while still in high
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
school not only do I think it will help
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
with affordability and access of
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
postsecondary Education I think it's one
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
of the ways in which we can increase the
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
likelihood that students who are already
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about college but often think
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
about leaving the state to do that will
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
find their way to our system and to the
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
university system through those Pathways
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
I I think we can make this not just a
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
close to grad uation here's a pathway
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
but embedded in grades 10 11 and 12 as a
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
real core opportunity streng thank you
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
the next area I wanted to pursue is
 
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.549 align:start position:0%
the next area I wanted to pursue is
staff

00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:11.799 align:start position:0%
quality uh there historically has been
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
an arrogance around higher uh four-year
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
colleges Visa that of two-year colleges
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
and so as you begin to look at
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
uh the next area I'm going to talk about
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
is content but leading into content uh
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
how have you been been able to deal with
 
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.669 align:start position:0%
how have you been been able to deal with
that

00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
arrogance uh about quality of staff at
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
the higher at the four-year institutions
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
Visa that of the two-year institutions
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that um these the staff at
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
the two-year institutions are not in
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
competition with those at the four-year
 
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
institutions so the question is is to me
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
is that how is the quality of uh monitor
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
at the two-year institutions as relates
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
to dealing with the four in fouryear
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
institutions want go first or you want
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
first you you I I'll go first on that
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
one um you know I when you start asking
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
that question about quality and my mind
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
turns to dson cofman and Kim Pera two of
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
our nursing program directors at Great
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
Bay and at
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester Peter L Monica and Dan relle
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
a couple of Faculty members in it and in
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing at
 
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh e globber nursing faculty
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
at River Valley quality faculty members
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
preparing students I think I've talked
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
to this group before other certainly
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
other House and Senate
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
committees five years in a row New
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a distinction of the
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
highest firsttime enclex pass rate for
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
associate prepared nurses anywhere in
 
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.070 align:start position:0%
associate prepared nurses anywhere in
the

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
country that doesn't happen by accident
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
it happens because we have faculty
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
committed to their discipline committed
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
to their students committed to the to
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the work that they do as as Educators
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
and that type of quality is reflected
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
across the curriculum for our students
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm not worried at all about quality
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
well I shouldn't say I I'm not concerned
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
that quality isn't being met we worried
 
00:31:19.389 --> 00:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
about quality but not that it isn't
 
00:31:19.399 --> 00:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
about quality but not that it isn't
being

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
met I think I would second uh that I'm
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
not worried about quality at the
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
community college system more at the
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
four-year uh college system but I
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that some and especially
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
historically there's been this this
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
arrogance for different job types you
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
know if you are a professor at at UNH uh
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
that is has responsible ability not just
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
for teaching classes but also for doing
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
research and and working in partnership
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the state and other organizations
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
that is a very very different task than
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
being a faculty member at a four-year
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
college or at a community college
 
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
we recruit nationally and we recruit
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
faculty that have terminal degrees and
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
experience in the field and all of our
 
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
campuses do a great job I think of doing
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
that where we need to do a better job
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
and where I'm very very pleased is we
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
need to be sharing that data and getting
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
the communication going between the
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
faculty I think the enlex is a great
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
example that passage rate is the same
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
passage rate that we worry about at the
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
four-year college and so when our
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
four-year College faculty see that
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
two-year College faculty hitting those
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
numbers hitting those marks they gain
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
confidence in one another the last thing
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
I'll say
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
is our faculty are a distribution they
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
are not a monolith and we will never
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate arrogance any more than we
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
will eliminate um faculty that
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
underperform and are removed as a result
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
of our our annual or three year or
 
00:32:53.789 --> 00:32:53.799 align:start position:0%
fiveyear reviews depending upon what
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
their rank is um the bulk of our fact
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
faculty however value and are working on
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
these learning outcomes and when we can
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
get those learning outcomes aligned and
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
we can have the faculty working together
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
to get them aligned then they have
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
confidence in one another and I think
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's how you move the needle
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the work we're doing
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
right now thank you that moves me into
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
the next area you talked earlier about
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
um competency targets uh within
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
respective courses Etc so is that the
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
way is that the way that you guarantee
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
the quality of the content at the 2-year
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
institutions as students are looking for
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
a particular major Etc is it the is that
 
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
the competency questions that provide
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
the continuity between the institutions
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think it's necessarily
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
competency I think we have competency at
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
at all levels I think what we need to do
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
is make sure that the learning outcomes
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
being taught within the competency of
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
the faculty member align with what's NE
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
needed for those later level courses
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
so as I think about it I think about um
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
we do not want to set a student up to
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
fail at the next level and you can have
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
a very competent faculty member teaching
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
a first year course that just doesn't
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
cover all the topics because there's not
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
as comfortable with it and then at the
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
next level because that course gets
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
transferred we don't get covered that's
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
why you got to get the faculty together
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure they're covering the same
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
learning competencies thank you learning
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
out and and thank you for uh taking my
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
questions the final One deals with is
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
there a c this is the last one right it
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
is the last one yes good is is there a
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
is there a certain grade point that a
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
student has to have in order for that uh
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
for them to qualify uh transferring it
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
to uh the fouryear
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
institution yes uh so if you're chance
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
transferring generic credit you have to
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
have a passing grade of I think it's see
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
see or better yeah see or better now
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
coming back to one of your earlier
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
questions and embellishing a little bit
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
on what Mark said Mark is absolutely
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
right the the those systems that do this
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
the best get their course numbering
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
lined up that's a heavy lift the next
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
level is when within your pathway you
 
00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
can define a degree a grade level that
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
automatically transfers in so California
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
has been working in some of their
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
Pathways to say well if you're coming
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
out of the Community College with a b or
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
better or a B+ or better you're
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
automatically emitted into the next
 
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
level to transfer right into the system
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
I think those are discussions that are
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
going on right now that's that's where
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
we want to go thank you for answering my
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
questions and I'd like to follow up on
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
on the business here of the the uh the
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
ab C D or what your point average might
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
be I know that when I went to college
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
for my B bachelor's
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
degree a c was really tough to get in
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
some areas because you know that
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
now the level of Competency of some of
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
those I see coming out with A's or a 4.0
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
it's not a whole lot better than those
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
that came out with a 2.0 back in the
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
days so what kind of criteria and
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
competency are you using to say this is
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
a 3.0 or this is you know wherever it
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
might be and or is it still pretty much
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
subjective based upon professor
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
professor Mooney here that this is what
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
I see as a you know an average grade or
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
this is a superlative grade right here
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
is there criteria established or not so
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
between the the two systems so between
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
the two systems no great inflation has
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
been a problem for decades yeah it's a
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
problem in the K through 12 system it's
 
00:36:52.309 --> 00:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
a problem at the community college it's
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
a problem in higher education across the
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
country um those places where we have
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
the clearest learning outcome set is
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
where you get the best correlation with
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
grades there is some subjectivity to it
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
particularly in some disciplines um it's
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
something that I worry about I look at
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
grade reports every single semester and
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
we have conversations with Department
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
chairs and with with the Deans about hey
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
is is this really the the trend that we
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
want to have um I think it's something
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to work on it is
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
hard to go back and compare what you can
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
do and what we encourage all of our
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
faculty to do is take advantage of
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
nationally standardized tests whenever
 
00:37:36.069 --> 00:37:36.079 align:start position:0%
possible so that we have some Benchmark
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
to compare to and at the four-year
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
colleges we also rely on our external
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
evaluations for disciplinary peers that
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
come in the American Chemical Society
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
the American physical Society uh the
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
nursing CCN comes in and they do Deep
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
dive evaluations on most of our majors
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
and their they're looking for how is it
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
doing compared to other universities
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
across the country so that's the other
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
way we try and balance it but it's an
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
issue and we have to pay attention to
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
now I I would imagine it would be in
 
00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
this last part in this up that I have
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
but I I look at for example the
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment at maybe the community
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
college system you're probably going to
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
have a higher age bracket person coming
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
into the community college
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
system who is also looking for specific
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
skill orientation so they can be out in
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
Industry um they may not be good at
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
taking a practice that we have as
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
teachers have to take but they may know
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
how to teach they may know how to fix
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
that and pull that wrench and do what
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
they need to um so H how is how is this
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
being gauged you know I know I I I think
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
I understand you know that part in terms
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
of coming out of and working at the
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
community cous but are are those
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
programs at the four-year system
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there's different
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
styles of learning and there's different
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
you know and a person may be able to do
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
it it maybe just Mr Brown that can teach
 
00:39:10.829 --> 00:39:10.839 align:start position:0%
just as well as Dr Brown um so so the
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
grades the grades transfer as long as a
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
see or better they
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
transfer and and so so bottom line yes
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
it's being recognized from the community
 
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
we're going take a break and welcome
 
00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:24.200 align:start position:0%
Senator delandro to our meeting today I
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
hope the traffic wasn't too bad out
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:36.190 align:start position:0%
hope the traffic wasn't too bad out
there

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
have to drive
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
upce we're talking about transferability
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
of programs from one level to the next
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
years well it sounds like we're moving
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
now so where were we here uh you were
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
asking about uh grade transferability
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
and and is is a c a 3.0 the same at
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
system

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
what I will say is we accept the grade
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
in transfer as long as it's above a seat
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
are they equivalent for some students
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
yes for other students no but we don't
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
get down to the individual course level
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
in making those
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
decisions are there any other questions
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
here I I do have one more I'm looking at
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
nursing right at the top of it and I'm
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
sitting beside a nurse
 
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.589 align:start position:0%
sitting beside a nurse
here

00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
um if you're a nurse and you've you're
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
coming out and you have that two-year
 
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:56.829 align:start position:0%
coming out and you have that two-year
ticket

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be a nurse and and you'd like to go
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
on and maybe get into biomedicine or to
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
some other aspect of the medical field
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
Audiology um are your courses that you
 
00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
took I don't want to call them Jed but
 
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
they're pretty specific to
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
nursing anywhere you do are those going
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
to be accepted in the other program it
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
might be somebody that's majoring in
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
nursing at the fouryear system are those
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
basic courses going to be approved
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
for the that other degree so are they
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
transferable within the system and
 
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.910 align:start position:0%
transferable within the system and
between

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
systems so the I want to make sure that
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm answering the question that
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
you're asking uh so you're saying this
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
is a student that's been successful
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
taking their uh associates degree in
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
nursing and they now want to transfer
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
into a four-year college but they're
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
going to Pivot a little bit because
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're attracted they want to
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
go into to uh other Allied Health fields
 
00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
and so the question is will those
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
courses transfer in into that other
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
field biomed biomedical engineering or
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
something uh the answer is right now
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
they would come over as general credit
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
and then the advisor would go through
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
the transcript and say which ones count
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
and which ones don't if they get off
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
their if they go to a different pathway
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
for example um the math that you would
 
00:42:26.589 --> 00:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
need for an associates degree in nursing
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the same math you would need to
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
Pivot into an engineering field if you
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to medic biomedical
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
engineering that's okay we can we'll
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
take that in that advising conversation
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
and say you know all of these transfer
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
you get the general education credits
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
but now you have to take this additional
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
map of course those conversations take
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
place what we'd like to do as we work on
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
these Pathways and nursing is a great
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
example is make sure that we have the
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
pathway defined so that some of those
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
shifts are defined for the student
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
before they come across cross so for
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
example let's pick on nursing there are
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
several Allied Health programs that take
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
all of those nursing credits right
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
across and we know that now because
 
00:43:09.069 --> 00:43:09.079 align:start position:0%
we've looked at them but if you get too
 
00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
far a field you might have to pick up an
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
additional MTH we'd like to be able to
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
define those sooner for the students so
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
they know it before they before they
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
complete their time in the community
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
questions okay yes
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
Senator transferability has been a
 
00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
Senator transferability has been a
significant

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
problem through throughout our system
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
which I've never really understood to be
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
honest with you and as I said we worked
 
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
on we worked on this for years um
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
Governor Peterson and I were on this
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
Commission in in in today's world we
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
have limited space particularly let's
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
let's refer to the nursing situation so
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
you get an associate degree at say at
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
the community any college level and you
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
want to transfer to a
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
BSN and first of all spaces is is a
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
problem but if you can't move everything
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
that you've taken at the associate
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
degree level and you have to repeat or
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
or get certain courses what what you're
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
doing is extending the time for that for
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
that individual and there's a cost
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
situation involved in that because the
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
kid went to the to to the initial
 
00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:26.710 align:start position:0%
kid went to the to to the initial
program

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
to get the associate degree and don't
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
have to expedite you know you know
 
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.349 align:start position:0%
have to expedite you know you know
moving

00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
moving
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
forward but the but the problem I see is
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
the kid gets discouraged when they bring
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
that transcript to you and and we talk
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
about Allied Health this this and this
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
and and the kid finds out gez I I've got
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
60 credits that for my associate degree
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden half of them half of
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
them don't fit and I got to retake them
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
or or do something or or do something
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
else can't can't we create some kind of
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
a of a a Synergy between the associate
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
degree programs and what we expected for
 
00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:08.839 align:start position:0%
the baloran degree because the law now
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
says you got to have a baloran degree I
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
I worked on a situation recently where
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
we we're allowing you know regular irns
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
to practice and not to get their BS
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
until a later date but we're putting
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
pressure on people to get more education
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
it and yet we're stabing them attribut
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
to transferability Senator going to
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
drawn 17 years in the University of New
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other seven with grand
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
state for coming commity college system
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
we have relatively few instances where a
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
student would find that kind of a
 
00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.549 align:start position:0%
student would find that kind of a
derailing

00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
derailing
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
situation unless a student is making a
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
significant change where their associate
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
degree was in business but now they want
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
engineering or their associate degree
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
was in nursing and now they want
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
engineering in almost any program that's
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
generally aligned there may still be
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
some small disruptions there but using
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
nursing as the example the the longest
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
um established program 3 plus1 RN to BSN
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
between the two systems allows a student
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
in the community college system to
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
finish not just the associate degree but
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
the third year toward the fouryear
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
degrees and in transferring to the
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
university system through what is now
 
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
College of professional studies not only
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
having all of those courses flow through
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
but actually retaining the community
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
colle system tuition rate to finish that
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
degree so there are some very
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
well-crafted Pathways and relatively few
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
situations like the one that you and
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
Governor Peterson began to try and
 
00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
overcome 30 years ago we've gotten if if
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
you don't mind if you would go to page
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
two the third page in your pack has a
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
list next
 
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
one yeah that
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
list uh so that is the list of the
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
pathways right now now as it was a time
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
of the writing this report 10 of those
 
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
now have those Pathways defined exactly
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
the way you want it to be there's six or
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
seven more coming on by the end of
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
December and we will complete this
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
entire list by the end of next
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
year just just so you know I think a key
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
point and and you you implied it but I
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
want to call it out another part of this
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're not costing students
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
more money is we have to get that
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
advising to them sooner we need to let
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
them know that pathway exists and if
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
they take these courses in sequence at
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
the community college then they will be
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
able to graduate within that foure
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
window that you talked about I I'll also
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
remind that the language in House Bill
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
1530 describes the optimizing the
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
affordability and utility of the
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
community college system so in some ways
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
like the 3+ one maybe not quite as
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
clearly as 3+1 what we had anticipated
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
students could progress within the
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
community col system Beyond just 60
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
credits to fully Leverage The the
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
alignment that's being created
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
capitalize on the convenience the access
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
the quality as well as the affordability
 
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
transition that's that's great that's
 
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
great news but I I'm thinking of now uh
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
St Joseph's wanted an associate degree
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
program so I fixed that for them so they
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
they got the associate degree now how
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
will those people
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
how how do we make sure that they can
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
move through this portal in in in the
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
same fashion because it seems to me with
 
00:48:36.589 --> 00:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
the shortage that's that's occurring all
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
over the country that these nursing
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
schools that shut down themselves you
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
know that they all had nursing schools
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
we had nursing school at at New
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and all of a sudden
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
we we let it go now they reinstituting
 
00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
them now who oversees their situation
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
and how does that kid make a make a
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
trans position or is it covered so at
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
the four-year College we we all of our
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
campuses have uh transfer portals that
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can come through right now we're
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
working in collaboration with ccsnh to
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
to have a common portal so that that
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
that exists the course equivalencies
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
exist for many different institutions
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
that we probably have about a 100
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
different institutions Mark was at un
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
when we were setting the beginning of
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
those up uh so a student coming from a
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
St Anum if they wanted to transfer in
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely could and where that course
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
equivalency already exists is taken care
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
of if it isn't we go through and we do
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
the course byour checking uh to help
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
through so there where my head is going
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
is is into nursing where I think we have
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
a bigger challenge right now that high
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
school students aren't choosing to go
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
into nursing our the number of
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
applications across our systems into
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
nursing is going down and so we have a
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
broader National and Statewide problem
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
of of how we make that degree path more
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
attractive is that I thought we were at
 
00:50:10.109 --> 00:50:10.119 align:start position:0%
a a point where we had more I thought we
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
were at this peak here are we now going
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
back down from that Peak that's what
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
we're seeing at the four-year College I
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't know the Community College data
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
but that is what we're seeing across the
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
country at foure college that pandemic
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
had a detrimental effect on healthare
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
interest in careers I mean it's create a
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
lot of wear and tear on those folks who
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
are there and I think it has dissuaded
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
many people who are interested I'll
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
offer you an interesting uh fact though
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
last year we had 416 students enrolled
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
in our nursing programs across the
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
community college system 79 of them
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
already held a bachelor's degree in some
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
other discipline so our nursing students
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
have always been uh
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat older uh group than traditional
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
age students coming typically from other
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
career paths and in that regard I still
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
think we'll we'll find students who have
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
the interest not necessarily coming
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
directly out of high school but but
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
folks who recognize that calling later
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
in life okay before we go with a whole
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
lot more questions um we're nearing 11
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
o'clock yeah I'm I'm watching
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
I wrap it in five minutes that would be
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
great um are there any areas that you
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
would like to speak to before you have
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
to get out of here Wayne it turns out
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
the questions have taken us through I
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
think many of the things that we're
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
working on for transfer Pathways I'm
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
very very appreciative of the
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the community college
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
system at our at our last provos council
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
meeting this is the group of all the
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
provos and vice president for academic
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
Affairs for all of our campuses at ccs
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
and usnh we all said to ourselves you
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
know we need to think more carefully
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
about how we communicate this
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
partnership out and so we'll be working
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
with Mark and with Kathy and and others
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
to think about how we do that
 
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:55.870 align:start position:0%
to think about how we do that
communication

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
I'm going to rec represent Mooney here
 
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:00.440 align:start position:0%
in a second but my my last thing before
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
you head out over 60% of our kids go
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
outside the state of New Hampshire to go
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
to college
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
University are we going to get some
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
transfer Pathways to have kids from
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
UMass l or from UMaine
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
Oro Southern Maine all those colleges
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
around us in universities say Hey you
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
can you we'll we'll we'll transfer your
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
credits in here and we'll take you as a
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
junior or whatever to get those kids
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
coming back to our state where are we on
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
Miss uh we do that in fact so the number
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
of transfer students at UNH increased by
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
nearly five and a half percent this year
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
most of it was New Hampshire residents
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
that had left the state and decided to
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
come back and so what we're discussing
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
now is how do we do more advertising and
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
more promotion in that space we
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
literally created a program where we
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
communicated with all of the students
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
that were admitted to UNH last year that
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
did not choose to come we invited them
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
to come back and offer them the same
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
trans the the same financial aid package
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to come back to New
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think we have to do more
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
creative things like that it's not a
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
curricular problem the curricular
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
transfers pretty smoothly it's more of a
 
00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:17.079 align:start position:0%
making sure that they feel welcomed and
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
that they feel that there's a place for
 
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
go represent money did you have a
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you very much Mr
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and the senator reminds me of
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
something very key to all of this I
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
think and that is on the high school
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
level the guidance Department keeps a
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
very close track of the students ideally
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
even divided by alphabetical names so
 
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
that they know uh who's on track to
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
graduate the idea being that there is no
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
major surprise a month or a semester
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
before graduation that this student is
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
not uh qualified because they're missing
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
a course or they don't have the proper
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
grade Etc to avoid that surprise so I
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
guess my question is to avoid the
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
surprise of having all of these credits
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
and doing all these things and then it
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through who my question is I
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
guess two ways first who right now is
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
keeping track of that and you did
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
mention the keyword advising so that's
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
going on and then second of all if it's
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
necessary where in this bill would it be
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
that they would be advised and tracked
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
essentially to avoid any major
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
disastrous surprise at the end of their
 
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
journey I offer that one one thing to
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
know about our students is about 70% of
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
them are part-time students so the pace
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
at which they go through is a reflection
 
00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
of their lives and so stopping in
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
restarting so it's not necessarily one
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
semester what might look like the next
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
semester me in fact be a year
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
out Pro for for our students register is
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
probably the person most aware of what
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
the students progress is toward a degree
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
and their advisor I think what provos
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
Jones described earlier was some
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
software solutions that we may look at
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
that would allow a student to actually
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
map their degree progress not just to
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
complete the degree with us but the
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
alignment toward the transfer into the
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
university system there's a product that
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
the university system is adopting now
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
that one of our campuses has already uh
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
initiated that may prove to be a
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
solution that allows us to have a little
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
bit more surveillance and vigilance on
 
00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.029 align:start position:0%
bit more surveillance and vigilance on
that

00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
Senator just have a comment I want to
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
make a plug for the nursing program I
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people don't know what a
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
nurse does and if two years of
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
nursing opens up a field and there are
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
so many different areas within nursing
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
that you can go you can go for your
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
Balor and you can be a floor nurse but
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
you have Specialties within nursing you
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
have IV nurses that are just fantastic
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
setting drips and whatever you have
 
00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
pediatric nursing you have clinical
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
nursing you have nurses who work in the
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
community clinics so I think that it
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
would behooves us to let people know
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
what does being a nurse mean it doesn't
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
mean just one thing it's a whole field
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
that is uh is opened and it I think the
 
00:56:27.870 --> 00:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
two years gives you basic understanding
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
of what's going on but it does not
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
prepare you for all of these other areas
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
and you have to continue maybe some of
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
your basic stuff you already know but
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
you need to go into more depth you need
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
to have more clinical understanding more
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
anatomy and physiology you need to
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
understand more about systems in order
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
to to progress and I think if that opens
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
up and I think people see the
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities I think that that's uh
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to go long
 
00:56:59.390 --> 00:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
ways that's why I have this Cardiology
 
00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
me yes represent my student population
 
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.270 align:start position:0%
me yes represent my student population
is

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
declining competition is out
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
there how are you dealing with that so
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
the so there was a a study done around
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
2012 13 that that we've been tracking uh
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
Professor named Gro uh published a very
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
nice report that talks about the
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
demographic Cliff the demographic Cliff
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
is hitting different states differently
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
but in New England we're getting hit
 
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
hard he projected in 2015 that we see it
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
we would see a decline of about 17 to
 
00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
18% overall in the number of students
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
graduating from high school and choosing
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
to go to college notice those are two
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
separate pieces both going in the wrong
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
direction um they hit campuses
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
differently community colleges get hit
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
differently than four year colleges get
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
hit differently than research centers
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
where are we today in New England is
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
we're about two-thirds of the way
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
through the decline it has hit different
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
campuses differently as we look at that
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
same data going forward what do we see
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
we see that we're we're kind of as for
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
four-year colleges we are probably at
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
about the level we're going to be 10
 
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
years from now so we've hit a point
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
where we can say all right let's this is
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
going to be our size how do we deal with
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
it over the next 10 years however
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
between in the next 10 years we're going
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
to see a wave that goes up for a couple
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
years and then we're going to see it
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
drop down for a couple of years and then
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
it's going to come back so that we have
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
this sine wave coming through the
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
challenges in New England particularly
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
for four-year colleges and Mark can
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
speak to the two-year
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
colleges how do we make sure we're built
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
for the right size and I believe that
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
size is about where we are now and then
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
not grow inappropriately for the next
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
couple years while while the wave goes
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
up and be in a position where we can
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
strategically invest so so that when the
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
wave goes down again we remain stable
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
and keep improving the quality of
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
Education like we've always done I'm
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to approach this question a little
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
bit differently and and disagree a
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
little bit in the sense I I would make
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
the case that the need for postsecondary
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
education is going to be greater over
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
the next 20 years than it has been just
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
because of the pace of change in
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
technology the changes in Industry
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
creation of
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
biofabrication as an industry in New
 
00:59:27.029 --> 00:59:27.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire something that didn't exist 20
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
years ago is going to create great
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
demand the need for succession in
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
virtually every industry is going to
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
require more education but it's not
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
going to be 18-year-old high school
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
graduates that part is accurate I'm
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
going to say that specific to the
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
18-year-old high school graduates one of
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
the things this October most recent
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
report on free and reduced lunch
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide 24% of children K 12 are
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for that Manchester close to
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
50% Franklin almost
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
60% Berlin Claremont you go through the
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
state and you can find places where 30
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
40 50% students so the need for
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
affordability so even though the number
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
of 18y olds may begin to level out the
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
need for access to Affordable
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education for that group
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
is going to be greater it's going to put
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
more pressure on both the university
 
01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
system but the community college system
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
and these Pathways and the running Start
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
programs to allow us to help students
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
make that leap right now community
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
college system almost 40% of our
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment is 25 or older and going back
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
to the example of nurses who come to
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
that career later than post High School
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to see more students
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
more adult Learners who going to need
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
more education over time shorter
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
programs where they live online
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
accessible so they can continue with
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
their families with their jobs with
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
their lives while they prepare for
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
whatever comes next so I think that that
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
there's a demographic turn that 18y olds
 
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
but the broader picture of our state's
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
demographics I think produces a much
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
more complicated view of postsecondary
 
01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
for US
 
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
senator thank you have you finish bill I
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
I think two things that occur to me are
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
a the competition is dramatic I've seen
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
the UMass ads and I know
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
MBI okay so you got a congressman who's
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
now the president of of the University
 
01:01:24.119 --> 01:01:24.990 align:start position:0%
now the president of of the University
who

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh selling that University with
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
significant resources so that a that
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
competition we talk about this we're the
 
01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
second oldest state in the United States
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
all right so unless we get a surge of of
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
of people and I we're going to have a
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
problem for an extended period of time
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
so a
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
competition price becomes significant I
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
was listening to NPR this morning you've
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
held the price again uh it's stable for
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
for what 25 24 25 right so so that that
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
news that that news was on the uh was on
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
the radio this morning so uh the nature
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
the nature of the Beast is is is
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
changing we're we're in a highly
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
competitive market now when I was a when
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
I was a a student in high school coming
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
UNH was
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
like Primo if you got into UNH you were
 
01:02:24.039 --> 01:02:25.390 align:start position:0%
like Primo if you got into UNH you were
really

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
on top of the world and and uh now now I
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
see you can get into main Connecticut
 
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island Massachusetts and the
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
competition is is fierce I never in in
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
my life thought I'd see Billboards
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
announcing College come here because
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's cheaper or it's I mean I I see
 
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
those all all over and and U does that
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
denigrate the qu the the idea of of
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
Education we're selling it like a
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
product you know uh I mean I I see it it
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
it it's disturb it's disturbing to me to
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
to see a billboard that says come here
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
because it's cheaper never mind quality
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
I mean if I would love to see a
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
billboard say how about a beer truck
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
with gold black bears inside of it this
 
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
is you know this come because it's a
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
wonderful school you're going to get a
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
great education and your chances of of
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
doing better in life uh I I just think
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
the the competition in my opinion is
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
fierce you got to go way quickly so I
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
have to go I'm you address I'm gonna
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
give a a quick response and a and a
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
brief wrap I I worry about that too I
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
worry about that for our society I think
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
the most important thing we could do is
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
focus on the value of the education and
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
something UNH is very proud of is the
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
three years in a row now we've been in
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
the top 10 in the country for Best Value
 
01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
in public higher education in the
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
country I I think that the price Wars
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better phrase and the
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
change in student Behavior at the 18 to
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
24 year old level have caused some of
 
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
that shift I think the future is going
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
to be thinking more broadly about the
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
other things that the university brings
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the table 20% of our students are
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
graduate students getting master's
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
degrees and phds 20,000 students took
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
advantage of individual courses and took
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
advantage and of extension programs
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
professional development and training
 
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
those are areas where we're having a
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
massive impact and we need to grow that
 
01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:31.799 align:start position:0%
and it's a revenue stream I answered
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
your question directly but my colleague
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
could not be more correct that there's
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
lots of growth elsewhere we grew the
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
number of transfer students we grew the
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
number of graduate students we grew the
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
number of students taking professional
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
development training and getting micro
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
credentials and certificates that I
 
01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
think is where we have to focus for the
 
01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
future I'll finish with just one brief
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
comment and that's a thank you to to my
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
colleague at CCN SNH
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the teams that have been doing this
 
01:04:59.269 --> 01:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
work I didn't do any of this work lesie
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
and Kate on our team and all the faculty
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
working on each of those degree programs
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
have done a great job and they're
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
embracing it you know the arrogance that
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
we referred to earlier we're not seeing
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
it I think that we're seeing
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
collaboration and that's the way we're
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
going to be successful thank you Wayne I
 
01:05:18.029 --> 01:05:18.039 align:start position:0%
I do have one you know you can go but
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
this is more directed for Mark I'm not
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
like oh good I'm we have a teacher
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
shortage in this state and we have a
 
01:05:26.829 --> 01:05:26.839 align:start position:0%
number of pair of professionals that are
 
01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
working in schools that are saying I
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
want to become a teacher while we have
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
alternative Pathways for that we've
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
spoken with Steve applebe regarding that
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
however for those folks who decide to
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
take some of their courses at your level
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
at the community college level are you
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
seeing that increasing and if so are
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
there any issues in the transferability
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
of those courses that you're taking
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
because it's not one of those 10 that
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
been checked off hopefully it's on the
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
seven that are you thinking closely to
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
but is are what they do at the community
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
college system let's say at White
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
Mountain uh is that able to transfer
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
PSU education program without loss of
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
any of the course it is and and U
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State and and president Burks
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
and his team have been good enough to
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
allow students to actually finish
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
bachelor's program in Berlin uh by
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
sending f faculty to deliver so that
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
students from White Mountains don't have
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
to travel to Plymouth to complete that
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree so that that has not
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
been a problem we're not seeing an
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
increase but I will say one of the the
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
Innovative opportunities has been with
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship uh resource that we have
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
through apprenticeship New Hampshire
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
ccsnh is the hub for that activity we've
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
got a number of students currently
 
01:06:50.269 --> 01:06:50.279 align:start position:0%
enrolled in apprenticeships uh to become
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
Educators and it creates another
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
certification uh strategy for
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
particularly working adults who can't
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
afford to take time away to to gain the
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
credential so most of these people are
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
adults they're not you know students
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
coming in at age 18 so when they want to
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
go get their Junior and Senior year are
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
there any problems in the
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
transferability of that coursework to
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
the four-year system that you're encoun
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
either with PSU with Keen or with UNH I
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
I don't believe we're seeing barriers
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
for that program at this time and again
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
You're right our adult Learners are are
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
often tied to the communities they serve
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
they can't go away to college they're
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
not going to migrate from Littleton to
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
you know travel to Durham three times a
 
01:07:39.309 --> 01:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
week for classes so online is
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
increasingly important and the ability
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
for the cours work that they can do
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
locally to be applicable to degrees
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh integral to the success of of that
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
we down the roadways we won't be talking
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
about online I I've seen some of the
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
percentages of kids that are at at at
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
students at the community college that
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be a program that's expanded
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
online instruction obviously the
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
pandemic created a surge in the need for
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
remote instruction but post pandemic now
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
that we're down to what might be a new
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
normal across the system about a third
 
01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 30% of our credit activity is
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
occurring through online instruction it
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
varies by college from about 22% to
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
almost 50% High Watermark being at River
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
Valley uh River Valley has a number of
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
healthcare related programs draws
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
students throughout the state so the
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
clinical is concentrated on certain days
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
and certain locations but the didactic
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to deliver the course
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
content is is increasingly online to
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
make that more accessible to students
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
from from greater
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
distances what speaking of online maybe
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get to this but what what what I'm
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about is kids at the high
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
school level at taking these virtual
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
courses and choosing not to go to
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
school my my granddaughter chose not to
 
01:09:10.030 --> 01:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
not to go to school but to take her
 
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.309 align:start position:0%
not to go to school but to take her
courses

01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
virtually and she did that for two years
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
in high school the last two years of
 
01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
in high school the last two years of
high

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
school I find that to be very dangerous
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
situation you lose sociability you lose
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
interaction with with teachers as as as
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
well as uh you know fellow students Etc
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
are we going to an online World here and
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
and what what does that present as a
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
challenge what what the state has
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
already made a significant investment in
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
VX yes and for a lot of students that's
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
a complimentary opportunity for their
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
education they attend a high school but
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
it gives them access to courses that
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
might not otherwise be available allows
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
them more skill scheduling
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility I spent as I said about
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
seven years at granted State College and
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
I virtually everything we were doing was
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
online pre pandemic but if you would
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
talk to students there's a preference
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
for sitting face to face often but that
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
preference loses out to conflicts with
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
job with family with other
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I I think that there's
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
a balance that that that's at play there
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
where students may prefer to be in class
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
and with with their peers but but have
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
to navigate you know those competing
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
pressures it's one of the reasons why I
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
think this is a area of growth for the
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
community college system is that we have
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
the capability to deliver highquality
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
online programs but we also have the
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity at 11 locations around the
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
state to have those students physically
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
sit with their peers with
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
faculty engage services and I do think
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
that that's where the world is heading
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
is more balance of online access but in
 
01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:54.149 align:start position:0%
is more balance of online access but in
person

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
when you need it and when you when you
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
it it raises a lot of questions you know
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
that this one of the questions just pops
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
my mind I'm sure you've heard it many
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
times so you have onethird of your kids
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
online and you have the all these
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
Capital assets
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
facilities um which are now maybe half
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
full or third full whatever it might be
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
um then we have this deferred
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance associated with it all the
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions that we wrestle with all the
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
time um we currently have uh career
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
counselors from New Hampshire Department
 
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services employment
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
support Bureau who are regularly on our
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
campuses uh gives them access to
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
locations gives us access uh to
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
informing them about our program
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the clients that
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
they're serving um you're familiar with
 
01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
our Littleton academic center for White
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
Mountains Community College which hosts
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire employment security and
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
a head start program so we do have in
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
some instances uh Capital assets
 
01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
buildings that are larger than they may
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
currently uh serve but we are looking
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
actively at where we can build
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with state agencies with
 
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
other organizations whose missions and
 
01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
and clients align with our mission and
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
could create synergies that would be
 
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
better use of facilities and and create
 
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
more value for the
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
communities are there any more questions
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
for we're getting into an area that I'm
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
sure that will be discussed in the
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
future uh but Mark I want to thank you
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
very much for coming today and and
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking us through some of that we we do
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
have some other items on the docket here
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
which you you may want to get involved
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
with uh the the next one that we have
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
and we went through the pathways here uh
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs and that
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh but we're talking now about Kathy
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
preventure we're talking about the
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's executive order the task
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
force to realign or to align
 
01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education in our state and
 
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
there's also a follow-up LSR which is
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't know even where to start
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
on this thing Kathy uh sure so so um

University system happy to be here with
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Rubenstein um yes the
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
2003-06 establishing a task force um to
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
um for a strategic alignment between the
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
two public higher education systems and
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
to think about what we need for the
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
future for public higher education in
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
the state um Mar chin Rubenstein and
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
myself both sit on that that commission
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner of education has
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
designated Steve applebe uh the director
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
of higher education in the department of
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
Ed uh the Senate President has

designated Senator gray uh the speaker
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
has designated representative lad and
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative luno um community college
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
system has named uh Nick tus and Ed
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
Smith from its board and the university
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
system uh CH board chair has named
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
Jackie Eastwood and George H
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
and we uh await appointments from the
 
01:14:29.229 --> 01:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office on from two
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
representatives of business and industry
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
and um whether or not the governor
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
himself or a design will serve and the
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
governor um is also um shall select the
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
chair of the task force and so uh the
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
work is to be completed by March 31st uh
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
I do think that's going to be a heavy
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
lift for the task force which um
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative lad your lis R may be
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
completely appropriate to continue with
 
01:14:58.629 --> 01:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
the work of any recommendations that
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
come out of this task force by March
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
31st that's really all we have to report
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
at this time um uh if we could turn to
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
page two on the task force that the
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
governor through his executive order has
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
put in and the T task force
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
shall um I think want to make it pretty
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
clear that there's no
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
no mention of the word merger at all
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
correct within this whole process we're
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
investigating the possibilities of what
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
a strategic alignment might net Us in
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
terms of enhancing postsecondary
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
education in this state and so could you
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
address those bullets under
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
B uh I I I know that you've worked very
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
closely with Chancellor Rubenstein in in
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
some of the the areas that we have there
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
a the language was tried to come out
 
01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.390 align:start position:0%
a the language was tried to come out
mutually

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
mutually
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
um is there anything there that jumps
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
out at you or
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
is uh to be honest with you what jumps
 
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
out at me is the bullets under Item B
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
all should be need to be
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
considered it's going to be challenging
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
to to really dig into all those items by
 
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.590 align:start position:0%
to to really dig into all those items by
March

01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
31st so I I think the task in my opinion
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
the task force needs to start
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
with what do we look like what do we
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
need a decade from now and how best do
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
we get there but there'll be there are
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
10 plus members on the task force I'm
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'm only one um and these items I mean
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
the executive order require re Ires the
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
task force to look at all these items so
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
it certainly
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
will but time is going to drive how deep
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
we dive into each one of those bullets
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think the LSR may serve
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
as there may need to be
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
followup after March 31st on on a number
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
force Mark how do you are you kind of in
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
concurrence with that that that the the
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
March deadline i i c that's why in the
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
LSR you don't see that March date you
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
see the end of the year however um um
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is a huge huge topic and with all
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
the issues that are associated with it
 
01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:42.510 align:start position:0%
the issues that are associated with it
right

01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
now the commity comp system board has
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
already been having similar discussions
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh about what the future looks like and
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh your observation there's no reference
 
01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
to merger I I'll say that I also I'm I'm
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
less thinking about what we look like
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
but I am thinking more about what we
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
need who the students will be how
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
they'll be served the discussion earlier
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
about the non the adult Learners the
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
Need For Education available locally
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
online accessible shorter programs I do
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
think that we are in a period where
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
higher education is changing what the
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
demands of what we deliver are going to
 
01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
be different some of them and I think
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
that we've got to flesh out what the
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
deliverables will be what the need will
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
be before we figure out anything that
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
has to do with structure if we start
 
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
trying to uh make adjustments to
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
structure before we understand the need
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
I think we potentially put ourselves in
 
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction so my I I do
 
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
think it's a relatively short period of
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
time and I do hope that part of the work
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
of the task force is to get a more clear
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
understanding of what postc education
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
really looks like in 10 years uh so that
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
we're building something for the
 
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
future and and I will say the the
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of the March 31st timeline is
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
the urgency of the work so again I I
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
don't think it will be the end of the
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
work that that needs to be done but so
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
it it demonstrates there's an urgency
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
let's start the work in Earnest and go
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
to the next whatever the next piece of
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
work is related to
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
to the needs of our state with
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
postsecondary high Ed public
 
01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.870 align:start position:0%
postsecondary high Ed public
postsecondary

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
highed we we mentioned the word
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
affordability quite a bit in the morning
 
01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.669 align:start position:0%
affordability quite a bit in the morning
earlier

01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
today is affordability one of the
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
components that would come in for
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and when we're looking at the
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
overall alignment and structuring of our
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
University postsecondary Systems
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
um oh I think absolutely that's part of
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
the public Mission yeah
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think it's implicit in
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
raising educational attainment it's
 
01:20:06.189 --> 01:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
implicit in improving accessibility and
 
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
compatibility for students and on the
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
expense side the avoidance of
 
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
duplication the streamlining it's our
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
managing the expense side so that we can
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
we can better insulate students and
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
families from the cost
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.350 align:start position:0%
families from the cost
side

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
there other questions on this right now
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
representa well just a comment it comes
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
to mind in thinking more and more about
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
March 31st that that is more or less
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
crossover I think uh for the house and I
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
know a certain Committee in the house
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be very busy and a
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
chairman who's going to be uh very busy
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
during that time period so just budget
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
that in that's my comment thank
 
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
you yeah we'll try to budget that
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
in maybe schedule it in as a better
 
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
in maybe schedule it in as a better
word

01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
um it's uh when you take the seven
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
institutions that you have Mark and the
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
three Granite State is now merged in
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
with so we have three there so we have
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
10 higher education institutions in the
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
state that serve a
 
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
population that's from high school we
 
01:21:19.709 --> 01:21:19.719 align:start position:0%
have high school
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
kids involved with concurrent dual
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
enrollment we you have up to you know
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
people that are 90 years old still
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
working at it uh so it it it it's when
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
you take our state and our population
 
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.310 align:start position:0%
you take our state and our population
this

01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
state and you take the square miles in
 
01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.430 align:start position:0%
state and you take the square miles in
this

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:47.960 align:start position:0%
basis is it
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
sustainable to have 10 postsecondary
 
01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
sustainable to have 10 postsecondary
institutions

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
s and have a you know a source of
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we currently
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
have you know is is this structure that
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
sustainable not not sure how to answer
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
that question and there there are
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
certainly larger States but have far
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
more institutions both public and
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
private uh than the 27 institutions
 
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
public and private here in New
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I said earlier if if
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
I'm right about the fact that the future
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
requires more support for adult Learners
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
and for a lot of those students a
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
balance of online but local access than
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
having those touch points around the
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
state is going to continue to be
 
01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.030 align:start position:0%
state is going to continue to be
important

01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
for um for meeting the need of that
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
population I I think it's also fair to
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
say that the print at White Mountains
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
compared to the footprint at UNH or or
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
Plymouth they're they're not all the
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
same it's not 10 equally large so part
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
of it is not just 10 locations but are
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
the are the facilities at those
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
locations and the use for those
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
locations appropriate for what the
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
demand will be as I described earlier
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
we've recognized that we've got some in
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
some cases some capacity that's not
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
being as optimally used as it could be
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
and we are trying to find Partnerships
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
way to use that space more effectively
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of those communities and
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
in doing that we can presumably reduce
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
some of the overhead for those locations
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
while sustaining the viability of that
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
need my answer is I don't know yeah I
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't think a lot of us do I know at at
 
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're we're looking right now at how we
 
01:23:48.669 --> 01:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
start well we already have started to
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
shrink our space we just demolish two
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
residence Halls at Keane we are
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
undergoing a master planning effort
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
across the system right now to think
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
about how we continue to shrink the
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
footprint or
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
so I time will tell time will
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
tell uh and and I I don't think there's
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
any need to really go through the LSR
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
the LSR backup that is to really support
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
process if it's needed uh the makeup of
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
that commission uh is a little committee
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different um but very
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
01:24:41.950 --> 01:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
um so represent GL if I may ask a
 
01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
question yes what does distinguish your
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
LSR from the executive orders the use of
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
the word
 
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
consolidation and I am interested to
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
know whether that is part of your
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about the future is
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
consolidation of postsecondary Education
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
whether that implies merger or if that
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
really is more just generally your
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
question about 10 colleges and the scale
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
footprint I don't think that any
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
terminology should be taken off the
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
table um I do believe in consolidation
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
it can be done internally Within one of
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the systems uh I reflect on what
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
happened with uh the taking the athletic
 
01:25:31.229 --> 01:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
training program out of
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
Durham and shipping it up to Don Burks
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
up in Plymouth State uh are we going to
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
be able to sustain you know all the
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
separate types of programs which we have
 
01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
in education I know the book that you I
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
maybe you handed out to the trustees uh
 
01:25:54.070 --> 01:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
Chancellor uh the the book which talked
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
about Synergy and having to deal with
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
these situations right off here and
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
we've looked at
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
Henderson um the individual the third
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
party that got engaged in looking
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
that made the statement within that book
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
that two-thirds of students in these
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
universities that he's worked with are
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
in basically 12 type programs we have a
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
lot of other programs
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
and so all those other programs which we
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
have both at Kean at Plymouth un you um
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
can we do to the the cost
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
elements consolidate some of the
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
programs internally now I'm not talking
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
at the University Systems but working
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to try to bring programs
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
together so we can still have a physical
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
therapy program somewhere in our state
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
so we can have these types of programs
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
that's one way of looking that that that
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
that that's helpful I just wanted to
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the word
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
consolidation that that makes sense to
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
me yes represent M well I guess one of
 
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:04.280 align:start position:0%
the one of the questions you look at
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
higher education is you I've got a u
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
14-year-old and 11-year-old grandson and
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
granddaughter and I've often thought you
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
know and what's ahead of them in higher
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
education and you know one of the issues
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
I think that we we might be going
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
towards is that rather than a uh
 
01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
Bachelor of Arts degree people are
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
beginning to get all kinds of Badges and
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
certifications and short-term kinds of
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
programs that are Hands-On that aren't
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the the old liberal arts
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
program that you were prepared really
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
for nothing and until you got your first
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
job and that's when you really begin to
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
realize what what's available there and
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's as I've been thinking
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
about their future that's a thought
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
that's been going through my head is is
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
what what what what are they going to do
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and I know that the community college
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
system does a terrific job as it relates
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
to looking at you know a student can
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
leave there with a Microsoft certificate
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
and start with an $80,000 job I'm
 
01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
assuming and UNH also has been to look
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
at their programs from a standpoint of
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
certification programs and so the
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
question I have what then does what then
 
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
is a competition between the community
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
college system system of badging and
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
badging that higher education and so
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's one of the issues I think
 
01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
as you look at the at this whole topic
 
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
is what is that future going to look
 
01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
like because it may not look like the
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
same thing 10 years from now uh
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
particular as you look at the access to
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
information that we have right now I
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
mean my wife is is great at at asking
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
Siri things and I'm I'm I mean I mean we
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
were in a conversation with a couple the
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
other night at dinner time and he brings
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
out his computer he's answering all
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
these questions that we have with one
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
another and it it really that begins to
 
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
say well what what what does education
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
mean now with the access of information
 
01:29:06.119 --> 01:29:07.390 align:start position:0%
mean now with the access of information
so

01:29:07.390 --> 01:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
immedate I do I do think um provos Jones
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned it that we uh UNH has a
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
professional development and training or
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
Badges and certifications and so there
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
probably is competition going on um I I
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
will I will respect ful uh argue a
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
little bit that there there is benefit
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
to a bachelor's degree even if it's in
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
the liberal arts um Beyond just
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
preparing one for a specific job when
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
they graduate it hopefully an associates
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
degree or a bachelor's degree um
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
reinforces a love of lifetime learning
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
and thinking differently about things
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
and being exposed to things that you may
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
not otherwise be exposed to so I hope we
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
I hope we don't get to a place where no
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
one's ever going to college anymore
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're just um I don't I shouldn't say
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
just but but earning badges so we can
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
get our next job so I I think that you
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
know what represent mil we we had a
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
discussion back in March 27th about an
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
article that appeared in the Wall Street
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
Journal and the article was College
 
01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:24.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to take four years and that
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
was explained by Wayne at that time that
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
you could do it in three years there
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
programs you can do that in right now
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is that I had a
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
grandson that decided to go to school
 
01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
outside the state but he was also
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
accepted at at a college in between
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Hanover in New
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
London and and uh he opted not to go
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
there because at that point in time
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
there was some really shaky Financial
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
issues going on within that particular
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
institution and he didn't want to get
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
engaged in a program of study and find
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
out it's pulled out like we've had just
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
one college pull out within the last
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
week here in in our state so potential
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
students want to enroll where there's
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to be a program that's going to be
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
there four years H three years H six
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
years hence and so that's that's one of
 
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
the concerns I'm looking at personally
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that are we going to be able to
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
sustain education the way we have it set
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
up structurally and organization wise
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
now in this state and can we guarantee
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
that little Moren here when she wants to
 
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
go get her four-year degree is going to
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
be able to do it and and end up where
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
she starts or is she going to have to
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
pull it and go to another one within our
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
state are we going to are we going to
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
consolidate any programs we got nursing
 
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
in all our institutions right
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
I think we do we do yeah as I get more
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
clear on your thinking about the
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
consolid use of work
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
consolidation in both 187a and 188
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
University system Community colge system
 
01:32:10.709 --> 01:32:10.719 align:start position:0%
the word for our Board of Trustees is to
 
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
create well-coordinated systems of
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
public high education and I think that
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
maybe that's the word as opposed to
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
consolidation currently each resp
 
01:32:23.390 --> 01:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for uring coordination
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
within the respective systems and what
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
I'm taking from this conversation is the
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
need to assure coordination between the
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
two systems in a way that addresses that
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
I said we may not need all of the space
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
we currently have but I think we need
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
all of the locations we have because I
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
think they add value for those
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
communities as access points for
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
education so we may scale back what
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
we're delivering now I'll offer an
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
example of what coordination might look
 
01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:53.070 align:start position:0%
example of what coordination might look
like

01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
12 years ago 13 years ago with the last
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
Great Recession the federal government
 
01:32:59.870 --> 01:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
was flowing out money to community
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
colleges through tax Rants and one of
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
the objectives at the time was to not
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
create competition among our colleges
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
and so each College created slightly
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
different versions of programs which in
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
retrospect means that we've got a lot of
 
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
specialization in a lot of
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
uniqueness but there's not enough demand
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
to fully absorb all of that capacity
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple of Faculty who we
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
leading an initiative now this involves
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
robotics automation Advanced
 
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing to create a core program
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
accessible to students across the seven
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
colleges the first 15 credits would be
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
accessible to students anywhere creates
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
the foundation includes two industry
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials that are aligned
 
01:33:47.470 --> 01:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
with those courses and then allows for
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
specialization and and focus based on
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
what a region needs employers want in
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
that area what a student is interested
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
in pursuing allows us to create enough
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
efficiency in that system and enough
 
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
coordination to remove barriers for
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
students and capitalize on some of the
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
economies of scale that that the future
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
requires of us those are the kinds of
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
things that I Envision where a student
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
should still be able to start almost any
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
of our programs anywhere but depending
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
on how specific they want to be may
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
require that they that they some
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
accommodation whether that's du online
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
for access to the more specialized
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
training or or movement and again with
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
the exception of Littleton and Berlin
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
which are fairly remote if you happen to
 
01:34:36.750 --> 01:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
be you know closer to Manchester but you
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
could still have access to nhti Lakes
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
Region we have enough proximity that we
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
don't need to replicate certain programs
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
because we think it's not unreasonable
 
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
for a student to navigate those
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
distances it's a huge issue
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know in the state that I came from
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would be a small
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
region and it would be smaller than a
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
burrow and and so it's it's all mindset
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
and of course we're in New England which
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
if you weren't born in the valley you
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
know and your parents born in that
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
Valley and your grandparents born in the
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
valley you probably never serve in the
 
01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
select board and and that's that's New
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
England so um I I think there's there's
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
a need for us to be doing having these
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
discussions uh if not we're going to and
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
we we know we're we're headed to some
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
Cliffs right now in terms of financing
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
sustainability and we can't be blind to
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
those so it's time to have some open
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
discussion and I think this is a good
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
discussion and I hope the task force can
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
have equally as prod Ive a discussion
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
and more so than what we're having just
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
here just cutting around the edge a
 
01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
little bit any other yes represent
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
Mooney just a suggestion going forward
 
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
on this Commission in bullet two and it
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
goes back to an earlier comment I made
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
that improving accessibility and compa
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
compatibility for students that also be
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
included there is advising or tracking I
 
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
think that is the deliverable by which a
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
student can be
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
assured that they are on track to trans
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
for and attain their goal otherwise all
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
of these things on paper sound great the
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
things on advertisements and websites
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
and you know take this and that it all
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
sounds fantastic but unless the student
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
knows for a fact they're on that path
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to miss the mark so I
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
would just put that out I don't want to
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
edit a executive order that's not my job
 
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
description but if I were I would add
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
one of those words advising or track
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
backing to that
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
bullet thank you you could you could
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
though okay are there any more questions
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee today towards yes
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
Chancellor I don't I don't have a
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
question I have a a brief Public Service
 
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
Announcement oh yeah um the as you know
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
president uh Jim Dean at UNH is retiring
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
on June 30th and the search committee
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
has been named um truste Jamie Bernett
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
is chairing trusty Kathy green is vice
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
chair and they are conducting listening
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
sessions from for with various
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to provide input on what we
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the state um are looking for and our
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
next president of the university and
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
there is a legislative listening session
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning at 10 o' in State House
 
01:37:53.709 --> 01:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
103 there are also open sessions that
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
are being scheduled they're going to
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
wrap up these listening sessions in the
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
next couple weeks um but the if you if
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
you search on us UNH president search
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
the university has a website that has
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
FAQs and schedules and such that you can
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
attend open sessions by Zoom also but we
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
thought it important to schedule
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
legislative listening session so that's
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning at at 10 o'clock in
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
State House
 
01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:22.950 align:start position:0%
State House
103

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
103
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
okay we can try to we could Jen is it
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
possible that we could get notice like
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
that out to the education committee
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
you Al righty um thank you very much
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you what we need to do
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
as a high Ed study committee we
 
01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
are where do we want to go like do we
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
want to gather any further information
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
and and when we meet next it's going to
 
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
be harder because we're going to get
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
into the legislative season here uh but
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
are there any topics that we we want to
 
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
be looking at in terms of higher
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
ed or you just want to just take it as
 
01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.750 align:start position:0%
ed or you just want to just take it as
it

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
comes oh this this yeah the governance
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
there was a report that when we talked
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
merger 2021 I think it was um there was
 
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
a report that I was asked to put
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
together a committee on uh in the
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and there was a report that
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
was issued and that was sent to the
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
division 2 chairman in that time Karen
 
01:39:38.109 --> 01:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
umberger and dealt with a lot of the
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
issues and those issues which we dealt
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
with are identified uh on on the second
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
page here under March 27th we did
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
discuss it here as a group and the
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
issues that we brought forward were
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
governance affordability accessibility
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
vision for postsecondary
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
Education institutional mission and
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
vision statements what's the legislative
 
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
role and the and that time we were
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
talking merger merger Implement
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
implementation and impact and any
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations that's all within that
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
report and it was done um hastily but we
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
had uh a lot of input at that time we
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
had the chair of the trustees Joe Marone
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
came in and spoke we had people coming
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
up from Nei and presenting their
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation we had folks coming in
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
from the community college system and
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
University system to speak with us um we
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
took a lot of lot of input and we came
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
up with some issues that maybe need to
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
be looked at too even by the task force
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
or in this other report because we we
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
should gather as much as we can to move
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
forward so I can make that c that that
 
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
report available to everybody Mel I
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
think you were on that
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
y okay no it was one that we we we put a
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
joint committee together
 
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
from education policy in the house and
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%

01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this issue and in the report
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
we we we we gathered a lot I I think
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
some very very healthy information that
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
should be considered so I'll make that
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
available to
 
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.030 align:start position:0%

everybody
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
and that maybe we can go from there
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
forward uh one of the areas which we are
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
are concerned about too is the
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of social studies and
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
