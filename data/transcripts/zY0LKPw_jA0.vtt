00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to welcome everybody from
 
00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
our public to the education committee
 
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
today um we're here today uh as members
 
00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
of the committee to look at six bills
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
which we have retained we've retained a
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
total of 20
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
bills um and for your information we
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
have approximately 109 bills coming to
 
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
this committee for the next session and
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
so we dealt with over a 100 of this and
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
for committee members you know how much
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
time and effort that took to go through
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
that you magnify every bill by two or
 
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
three because we have hearings
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
we have to have exec sessions we may
 
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
have work
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
sessions and it's looking to be a very
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
very long January and February um so we
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
have 20 bills that have been retained
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
six today my goal is for us to try and
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
work these retain bills out and
 
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can we won't have anything
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
coming out with this 1010
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
business that was suggested in one
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
previous sub committee meeting the vote
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
was a 33 and I said I am not going to
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
accept that take it back and work it out
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
folks so that's my intent right now is
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
try to get as much to the floor that
 
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
where we can go in with an up or a down
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
motion none of this no recommendation
 
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
stuff and I think we have retained the
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
type of bills where we can work things
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
out um there's some good policy in some
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
of them and so that's where we are today
 
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
the first bill in the docket is
 
00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
147 we retain this uh it's a bill
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with the advisory uh uh Council
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
for special education and it dealt with
 
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
the issue of representation members on
 
00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
the issue of representation members on
that

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
Council and for several of us here we
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
have served on that Council before we
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
know there's Oodles of people there and
 
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh one of the the recommendation
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
contained within 147 just this refresh
 
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
pie people was that there's
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
representation from correctional
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
facility and and uh we also had the
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
county there two different
 
00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
facilities and so uh the motion was to
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh strike the one representative from a
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
County Correctional
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
Facility so um that's responsible for
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
administering this type of programming
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
in that facil facility to just one
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative of the Department of
 
00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
Corrections so with that I'd like to
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
open it up to members of the committee
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
here let's get some discussion on and
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
first represent Tanner you have your
 
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
hand up yes um after looking at that and
 
00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
and hearing some input um people have
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
said that the county is where uh the
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
representation probably should be
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
because County correctional officers
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
deal more with misdemeanors and would um
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
be dealing more with the age group that
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh we're um interested in dealing with
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
on this committee so just just as a
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
comment that I've had come to me I have
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
since had that same uh
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
discussion uh in Grafton and we have of
 
00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
course a correctional facility right
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
there in haal where I live and um we're
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
talking about uh a misdemeanor That's A
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
or B but you can get up to up to a
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
one-year trip there we have a a a people
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
in the past we've had come in actually
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
those that have not graduated they're
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
carrying an
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
IEP and we've had to chase down what is
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
where is the resident District often
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
times we find it's on the other side of
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
the county or it's certainly not coming
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
from necessarily where the person was in
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
trouble so it's up to those people
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
deliver that service so I I concur I
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
understand that the correctional
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
facility that's on the in the county
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
level is responsible for providing this
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
service many times over especially to
 
00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:00.919 align:start position:0%
people that are residents of our state
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
so other discussion on that yeah yes
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
represent B Bon um well I attended I'm
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
the new representative of that committee
 
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I happen to attend my first meeting
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
last night so I do have some fresh
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
information and I also want to uh I
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
wondered if we can give uh
 
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative katab some time as well
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
um because she is a prime sponsor of the
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
bill um so from what I heard last night
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's a everything has shifted they've
 
00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
got a new chair and everybody's um
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
adjusting one of the problems um with
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
this committee has been that they need a
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
parent majority um and currently where
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
50 51% is required they only have 42% so
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
they're having trouble uh retaining
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
parent membership so that has a lot to
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
do with retain um keeping the Quorum so
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
when you adjust the number of of
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
non-parent members you have to
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
subsequently adjust the parent members
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
to balance it out um they took a a poll
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
um it seems that currently the
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
membership of the committee would like
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
to keep both representatives from uh
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
Corrections um the comment that was made
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
at the time is that they uh serve
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
different purposes one's more longer
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
term and one's uh shorter term and um
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
also that uh they feel that um currently
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
I was told that the populations from
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
both of those areas are similar at this
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
time and um regarding the addition of
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
the medical uh person
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
um the although the committee really
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
would appreciate that um point of view
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
and perspective it would alter um the
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
the Corum requirements to add an
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
additional person without taking off the
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
other p position um and there was some
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
talk about um maybe instead of having an
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
active voting member of the committee
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
having medical professionals uh with
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
differing expertise uh come to consult
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
the committee at other times um again it
 
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
was just my first meeting and I don't
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
know a lot about the history so that's
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
why I would I was wondering if we could
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
let representative katab address why the
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
bill was what I want to do is get some
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
of the issues out on the table here
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
first did everybody receive the
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
communication from Bonnie she's here
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
also and and uh she's put together a
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a history with what CMS she
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
shows where it's been over the years
 
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
with membership and I think I I took
 
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
some time I saw first time this morning
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
Bonnie on on on my email I opened it up
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
and it was very it's not the type of
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
reading you want to read before you go
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
to bed but it is the it is good reading
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
and informative reading in terms of how
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
this thing has
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
developed and how the the council has
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
developed so now we do have some copies
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
of that Bonnie brought in 12 I do have
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
one on here so we have one two three
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
four so let's let's pass these out if
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
you have a copy uh you know pass it by
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
so I'll pass going this
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
way and
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh we also have a number of folks that
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
are absent today um and many are are are
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
due to they have do appointments for
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
themselves family doctor's appointments
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
veterinarian appointments uh business
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
outside the state and with that um I do
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
not plan on taking any specific action
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of this I will take a straw
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
vot to see where we are in certain
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
issues so we can sort of like we did on
 
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
266 the other
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
day so does everybody have a copy of
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
this right
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
here so before we we get into the
 
00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
here so before we we get into the
current

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
Bonnie could you come forward please and
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
try to just go through that a little bit
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
with us so that there's a lot that have
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
not looked at this this is a historical
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
view of this what happened back in the
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
days that Nancy Styles Senator Styles
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
was engaged with making some of these
 
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.629 align:start position:0%
was engaged with making some of these
last

00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:27.870 align:start position:0%
 
changes

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:34.629 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
is the red light on or do put no there
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
you go thank you now it is thank you
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um I was curious to find out
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
when did different committee members
 
00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
start so I went back and found the 1994
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
version um and it was interesting to see
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
how much larger the state advisory
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee was back then when it was
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
first formed there were members of
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
Representatives of school up a school
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
board the commissioner um a
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
representative from the State Board of
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
Education and so on and then we weaned
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
some down over over the years and added
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
a few so I tried in here to First
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
include the ones that were consistent
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
with idea and that have not changed um
 
00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
and we they didn't start requiring a
 
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
majority of parent members on idea until
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
2004 um which is why in the very
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
beginning there was a requirement for
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
seven parents and all of these other
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
people because it was it didn't have to
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
be a majority um New Hampshire is much
 
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
more specific whereas an idea they say
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
teachers we say how many teachers and
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
one needs to be a special education
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
teacher so we we we're true to our our
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
general theme of being more clear um the
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
first two pages are what we already had
 
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
whereas on the second page we had a
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative of the business and
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
industry Association in the very
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
beginning and then in 1998 it was
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
changed to one that was involved in the
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
transition of students with disabilities
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
but it was kind of similar um we added
 
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
the higher education and the um private
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
schools and the charter schools in 1998
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
as well um so that more of
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
the choice options were were available
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
um and in the very beginning the special
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
ed administrator was represented by
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
recommended by the New Hampshire
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
Association of special ed administrators
 
00:14:35.829 --> 00:14:35.839 align:start position:0%
and now it's just a special ed
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
administrator of a public program so
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
that is again a piece of clarity
 
00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
that is again a piece of clarity
um

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
the one piece that is that we are that
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is missing
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
actually if this person currently serves
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
on sack but it's not in RSA 186c it was
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
I think it was removed by accident and
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
that's on
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
the next to the last page where idea
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
requires a representative of adult and
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
juvenile correctional institutes and we
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have a requirement for somebody
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
from the juvenile correctional institute
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
we had YDC until 2006 when I believe it
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
was removed by
 
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
accident so you may want to put that
 
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.829 align:start position:0%
accident so you may want to put that
back

00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
um and we've always had the two
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
representatives from the House and
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
Senate education committees parent
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
information center and disabilities
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
rights Center the last page were all of
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
the ones that were in
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
1994 and within the next four years they
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
decided that that was being a bit too
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
extreme and they got rid of of those to
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
lean the committee down a
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
bit so Bonnie
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
um you're you're fairly familiar with
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
the this Council
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
we have two members from the house and
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
two members from the
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
Senate every time we put legislation
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
together putting together a committee or
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
some kind we are getting wise and only
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
putting one Senator because we're lucky
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
to get one yes um what's the attendance
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
of of the Senators on on this I actually
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
did a chart of attendance um several
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
years ago and the attendance of both
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
House and Senate is pretty slim um which
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
is why they typically AR counted towards
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
the Quorum if they're not there
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
um I think because people are so busy
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
and so we sometimes have one of each but
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's very very rare that we have even
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
two Representatives um and I can't
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
remember the last time there were two
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
senators present at a
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
meeting when I was and I couldn't
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
present there have been pretty broad
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
stretches when there wasn't one
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
appointed um and there was one instance
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
when um it was rep Jack balom from marac
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
he was on this committee was primaried
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
and so he was not reelected and he was
 
00:17:15.549 --> 00:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
on the state advisory committee but his
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
term hadn't ended for the state advisory
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
committee he just didn't exist in the
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
House Education committee any longer um
 
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
and so while it doesn't say it in the
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
statute informally committee members
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
from the House and Senate have remained
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
until removed by the president of the
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
senate or the or the um com the chair of
 
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
senate or the or the um com the chair of
the

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
house yeah Jack was vice chair and he
 
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
took over when I got off that came out
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
Council and yes put jack on he loved it
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
and he was very very into every issue
 
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
associated with special education yes so
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
um so that's information for the for the
 
00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
committee are there any thank is are
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
there any questions of Bonnie here on on
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
this sheet that she handed
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
us thank you very much yes represent dry
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just been on a
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
lot of committees is this a workable
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
number to get things
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
done there there have been quite a few
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
years when quite a bit was done um and
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
often times people break into smaller
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and then bring things back
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
to the full committee so it all it isn't
 
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.230 align:start position:0%
to the full committee so it all it isn't
always

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
25 people sitting in a room having a
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about a single topic from
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
this from scratch very often somebody a
 
00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
smaller committee has done the leg work
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
to bring it to the larger
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
committee there have been times in the
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
past couple of years I think Co
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
devastated the committee um and
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
particularly when you had to be in
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
person and have a quorum and many of the
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
members work with family members who are
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
very medically fragile and so they
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
simply couldn't show up and so the state
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
advisory committee literally could not
 
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640 align:start position:0%
get a quorum for almost two years for
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
that reason um and so couldn't do
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
anything prior to that I think it was
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
pretty functional I I think it's
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
daunting to think about that many people
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
on a committee especially with special
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for majorities and things
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
like that thank you for you're welcome
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
you're welome yes represent C cin just
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
want to double check so does it make
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
sense in your mind to eliminate one
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
Senate senator and have one Senator and
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
then have one representative from
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
YDC in my personal opinion yes that
 
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.190 align:start position:0%
YDC in my personal opinion yes that
makes

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
sense you wouldn't lose anything because
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
they don't come
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
anyway well that's that's what I'm
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
thinking but yet somebody from YDC can
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
certainly contribute pretty
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
substantially yes um and then I had a
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
second question can have a follow could
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
I ask a second question well you're
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
you're you're echoing my mind and I
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
you all right we're on the same then
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
after you represent Cornell on it's just
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
the follow up on the discussion with the
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
correctional officers so if a County
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
correctional officer which makes sense
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
to me because of the you know distance
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
and what they know in their
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
regions that that would
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
be um a
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
reciprocal position in a sense that like
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned somebody from Coos is
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
in Grafton would the Grafton County
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
person go would the
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
Coos person go so that they've got some
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility on one of them has to be
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
there versus yes and that actually can
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
happen because there's contracted
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
services to send two Graft in
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
surrounding counties okay all right
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the state prison
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's extra important
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
because they
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
provide uh sentence reduction options
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
for people who complete a diploma and so
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
on and if you need special ed and you're
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
not getting it right you're not going to
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
complete that diploma and so you have to
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
stay longer which is really
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
unfair right we have one of those
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell you do but yours is
 
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.549 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell you do but yours is
federal

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
well yeah perhaps Corell when discussing
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
YDC there's no more YDC it
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and even senuna Center we don't
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
really know what it's going to be
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
replaced with at this time for
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
youth yeah I don't know what the
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
juvenile correction agency is K
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
please right under the bus good morning
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Karen Rosenberg on
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
the policy director at the disability
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
rights Center um I think what the law
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
requires of someone not from YDC in
 
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
particular someone from Juvenile Justice
 
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
so that would so I right now our statute
 
00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
refers to it actually does refer to the
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
Youth Detention Center not sysc and um I
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that that name's changed even
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
in the the new law that was passed that
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
will reopen a new facility but regard I
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that matters so much because
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
really it's a representative from
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice Services and that's
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
what we have right
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
now I think that's
 
00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
clarifying any further questions for
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
either folks that are at the table oh
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Damon I just like to and thank you for
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
being here I'd like to hear either of
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
your perspective on the um additional
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
proposal to add a healthare provider who
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
has expertise in working with children I
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
frankly was surprised that that wasn't
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
already part of this
 
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
group I think that one of the
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
complications is that depending on the
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
disability it may be a a different kind
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
of health care provider so you would
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
need to have all kinds of people there I
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
understand at the committee yester last
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
night Karen was there so I'm I'm one of
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
so I mean and I'm not speaking for the
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
committee I'm speaking for disability
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
rights center right now um I think the
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
Challen there are a couple challenges
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
here one is that we want to make sure
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
that the committee gets the information
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
it needs about the interplay between
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
medical issues that are related to a
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
disability and education and so the the
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee might address or be interested
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
in looking at issues related to children
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
who experience mental health issues or
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
maybe children with developmental
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities or maybe children who have
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
specific learning disabilities and you
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
know that are related to dyslexia and so
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
there are different kinds of medical
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
providers who could be involved with
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
those children and having a generic
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirement for a medical provider may
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
not actually meet the committee's needs
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
to and and further our objective which
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
is to advise the commissioner on the
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
unmet need one of the our objectives on
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
the unmet needs of students with
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
disabilities so we may not by having a
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
generic medical provider we may not get
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
the expertise that we need on the
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
committee and then we would be required
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
to have at least two more parents of
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
children or students with disabilities
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
on the committee to meet the 51%
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
requirement which is really critical
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
it's very I mean this is a it's it's
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
very critical that parents of students
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and students with
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities are represented and heard
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
on this committee and the committee has
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
struggled to recruit and retain and have
 
00:24:44.909 --> 00:24:44.919 align:start position:0%
active participation of those members so
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know that the other part of besides
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily getting someone with the
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
expertise we might need at a given time
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
we would be needing to recruit even more
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
parents or students with disabilities to
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
have a better balance on our
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee interestingly there have been
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
times when the the educator special
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
educator or administrator was also a
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
parent or a surrogate parent but they
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
didn't count towards the total number of
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
parents because they were there in the
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
role of a special ed administrator but
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
they tended to bring both perspectives
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
to the table just an extra point of
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
consideration per
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
Damon so I appreciate the explanation
 
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
Damon so I appreciate the explanation
I'm

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
wondering since this healthc care
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
provider position has not
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
existed how does the committee obtain
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
the expertise that you just described
 
00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
that comes from varying different kinds
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
of providers I think there's different
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
ways that we could obtain that
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
information I don't know how much work
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
the committee has done in the past on
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
securing that kind of medical
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
information do you Bonnie no it really
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't come up but if it were to the
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
committee so we are we can have
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that include people who
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
are not members of the sac and that has
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
happened before so um that might be one
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
thing to do if the sac chose as a
 
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
priority looking for example at the
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
unmet needs of students with um
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities we might want
 
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
to consult with a developmental
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
pediatrician so and and and these folks
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
are hard to get also right so we could
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know reach out and involve that
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
person on a subcommittee that would be
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
one way another way would be to invite
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
someone to come present to the sack on a
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
particular issue um that is that has
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
that overlay between medical needs and
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
educational needs so we don't
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to have a
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative on the committee to
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish that and get the information
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
need so could language be followed up
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
with something like the fact one local
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
healthc care provider who shall
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
specialize in working with children such
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
as pediatrician appointed by the
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
governor as a nonvoting
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
member I I I think I don't know I mean I
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a little odd to be on a
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
committee and not have a vote like
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
you're I don't know that that's a good
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
precedent to set I think that if people
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
are making the commitment to attend a
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
monthly meeting for two hours be on a
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um they ought to be able to
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
vote on what you know and on
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations the committee might make
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
so I think it would set an odd precedent
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
for on the some of the Committees I'm on
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
which have technical support and as a
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
trustee with the university system we
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
have a number of Trustees which are
 
00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.870 align:start position:0%
have a number of Trustees which are
nonvoting

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
nonvoting
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
members but are tremendously influential
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
in in providing that information when
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
it's popped up and discussed by the
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
trustees so it it goes does it does go
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
both ways as warranted yeah yeah I mean
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
I I hear what you're saying I'm not I
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
also don't know how that would impact
 
00:28:06.669 --> 00:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
quarum if there's a non- voting member
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they wouldn't impact the
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
Quorum that would you'd want that to be
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
explicit um so that we don't end up in
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
that whole bind that we've been in when
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
it comes to voting the Voting is based
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
upon those which are voting members and
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
the Quorum is based off of voting
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
members I mean I I hear what you're
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
saying I guess that makes sense I I do
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
think that it would be helpful though
 
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:32.679 align:start position:0%
for the committee to look at where you
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
know what kind of Provider do we really
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
need where where are we really missing
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
information and to have a thoughtful
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
that who had the hand up first here
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner then representative K
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
did somebody in between have a hand up
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay goad thank you um I'm just
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's something that that
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
can be done either maybe not through
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
statute but
 
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
if if there's some way that we can help
 
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
recruit more parents I mean it there
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
certainly is enough across the state of
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
parents that are in that situation but
 
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure uh whether it's where you
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
meet or there were several parents who
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
were invited not to return well there's
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
that but actually okay first I think
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
you that that well there's that but I
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
think you all you all did do something
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
really helpful last legislative session
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
which was you passed
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
hp38 and what that as you recall did was
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
it made it so that for parents and
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities for whom it's
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
not reasonably practicable for them to
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
attend meetings in person that it allows
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
them to participate remotely and that's
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
hugely helpful in terms of recruitment
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
because as you know you know parents
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
have to take you can't be in two places
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
at the same time it's difficult for
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
parents to attend meetings in the AV
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
you know it's we don't have a lot of
 
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
you know it's we don't have a lot of
public

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
transportation child care so I think you
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
know you should be commended for that
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
step because that is going to make
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
recruitment a lot easier it's going to
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
make participation a lot easier La at
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
last night's meeting this the um
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
advisory committee did vote to allow
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
remote participation under HB 308 for
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
parents for you know for not just
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
parents but anyone for whom it's not
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
reasonably practicable for them to
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
attend in person we're still we still
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
have some technological glitches um
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
which are being worked out um because we
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
need to make sure the technology the
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi where we were meeting was terrible
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
last night but we're but that's being
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
addressed and so that is a huge thing
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
that you all did that should really help
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
tremendously thank
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
cascaden uh thank
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
you um so it's if there is the
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring in a specialist
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
because children with dis disabilities
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
as you know those Specialists could vary
 
00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.310 align:start position:0%
as you know those Specialists could vary
so

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
wide but as long as you have that
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
specialist when you need it then I don't
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
see why we need to have a health care
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
provider that's one thing the other
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
thing is you just mentioned parents can
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
now zoom into the committee
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
meeting which now gives you the
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity I don't know where the
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee meets but it gives you the
 
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have representation of
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
parents from every County or every
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
region um so I think that's a plus as
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
well so that's pretty much it that's
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
where I stand thank you we use technical
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
support and put them on people on
 
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
committees often I sat
 
00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:43.799 align:start position:0%
in uh two meetings this week already
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
where we had uh for example Steve
 
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
applebe uh sitting in who's director of
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
higher ed At Doe who sat in at the
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee we have tal
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hub who sat in at and
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
participated uh in the dissolution of
 
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
charter school or dissolution of charter
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
schools yesterday um so it's possible
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
put a technical support person but I I
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
kind of agree that your technical
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
support is going to vary whether it's a
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
pediatrician or it's somebody's dealing
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
with a severe Orthopedic issue of some
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
kind so it it's it's going to vary yeah
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
and and I think it really depends on you
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
know what issues people on the committee
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
become aware of
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
so we there may not be an orthopedic
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
issue right or there may be a real you
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
know we may become aware of students
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
with a certain type of disability having
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
struggling more to get have their needs
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
met than others and at that point it
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
might be really helpful to bring someone
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
in who has the technical expertise that
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
would really benefit the sax ability to
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
give appropriate rep um recommendations
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
my son sees a complex care physan
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
because because he's complex um and she
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
sees children and adults with a variety
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
of disabilities often multiple
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities um most significant but she
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't see children who have learning
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities as a primary category or
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
reading disabil just reading
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities or emotional disabilities
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
so even having someone like that you're
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
gaps right that's for Jack Bel was very
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
good because he was the
 
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
good because he was the
dyslexia

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
dyslexia
 
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.389 align:start position:0%
dyslexia
reading

00:33:33.389 --> 00:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
superlative um any other questions from
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very much
 
00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:48.590 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very much
representa

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
kab good morning good morning thank you
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
for having me up um do you have a copy
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
of uh Glenn rep cordell's uh proposal he
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
said that he was going to have it um
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
available yes we we do okay um because I
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
want to kind of comment on on that a bit
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
so I was appointed to se this winter and
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
I've been to I believe six of their
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
meetings now and I also want to point
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
out that while I am appointed as a House
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
member I do also have two children in
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
elementary school that are on IEP so I
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
could also qualify as a parent member
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
and just saying that in the sense that
 
00:34:26.669 --> 00:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
my heart's in it for for the kids um and
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
the committee is truly made up of some
 
00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:30.839 align:start position:0%
wonderful people who are volunteering
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
their time and and giving their best um
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to say that
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
of course everybody wants to be on the
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
committee and nobody's going to say sure
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
take my seat because it's a volunteer
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
thing so if they didn't want to be on it
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be on it they would have
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
just resigned um but I do think it's
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
important that
 
00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
we look at it from a lens of is the
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
committee actually meeting its current
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
purpose right now and if I'm going to be
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
honest the answer is no um in all of the
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
meetings that I've gone to they've been
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
focused on how the committee should run
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
itself and not talking anything about
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
children at all and that was the same
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
theme in last night's meeting as well
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure babon will agree with um
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
it's been talking there was two meetings
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
talking about a member that was on the
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee if she should be able to get
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
um an accommodation for her disability
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
in in terms of participating on with the
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
group there is a meeting that um
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
centered around 91a issues um there were
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
there was a several meetings and emails
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
that went back and forth basically
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
um asking the doe to provide a minute
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
taker rather than just appoint somebody
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
on the committee itself to be a clerk
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
and and of course to fund the minute
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
taker as well um and so there hasn't
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
been an annual report that's been
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
finalized and posted since the 2018 2019
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
season and I I do want to go back and
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
say that while the majority has not been
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
met by parents in a long time the last
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
report that I could find that it was was
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
was back in 2014 when uh Miss Dunham was
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
chair and I will say during that time a
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
lot of wonderful things were
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
accomplished there was Memo after memo
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
commenting on different policy changes
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
legislative changes and they even
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
organized a Statewide advocacy day
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
regarding special education so I think
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
the committee absolutely can function
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
but is it functioning now no and I think
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
we need to do something to try and help
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
fix that so I I think that's where rep
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
cordelli was coming from with with his
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and striking some further
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
people off of off of the group that were
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
not federally required um and regarding
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
the the pediatrician piece I think the
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
important thing to note is that while
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
Specialists each specialize in one
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
little niche pediatricians see see
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
children for every single that may have
 
00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.030 align:start position:0%
children for every single that may have
any

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
disability always and so they're the the
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper the one that's that's
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
giving out out um referrals to different
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
Specialists let's say a child like is
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
having is is speech delayed or needs PT
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
OT Ortho any of these reasons they're
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to be referring the child out and
 
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of times an issue is then
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
discovered and the parents are going to
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician well what do we do the
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
pediatricians are the ones that that
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
should be guiding them and telling them
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
well if your child's over three you can
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
go and get an evaluation and maybe they
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for special education because a
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
lot of parents don't know that the other
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
thing is part of an IEP is asking
 
00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:27.079 align:start position:0%
certain pieces if there's medical
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
necessity to them and if there is you
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
often have a pediatrician that's writing
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
a note that this device is medically
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
required for this child and we don't we
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
have that missing piece and I think why
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
it's important to have it is if that
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
person was on the committee and getting
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
this feedback and hearing things they
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
could go back um even to the New
 
00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.630 align:start position:0%
could go back um even to the New
Hampshire

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh Association of of Pediatricians and
 
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
say hey like there's this missing piece
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
would you mind sending a memo out to let
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
other providers know XYZ and so I think
 
00:37:58.349 --> 00:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
that part would be a hugely helpful and
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it should be a certain
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
specialized provider because then I
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
think you're getting into that niche of
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
only a
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
certain uh subset of disabilities and I
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
do kind of agree I do agree very much so
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
with what uh attorney Rosenberg said
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to ask somebody to
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
be on a committee especially one
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's not been functioning very well
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
like this one it's pretty frustrating to
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
go on a committee but then not be able
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
to have your voice because I think the
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
other pieces is that you know why
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
participate if you
 
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
can't kind of have a full voice on it so
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of their perspective that
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
I'm coming in and I you know I've heard
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
from several that sit up now and I'm not
 
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:41.079 align:start position:0%
going to point at anybody in particular
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
but that they've experienc similar
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
issues and so this isn't a new issue um
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
with sack it's been an issue for for
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
several years and I I do think there was
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
many years ago that it was working and
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
right now it's not and it hasn't been
 
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
for a while so that's kind of where I
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
was coming from thank you um
 
00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:03.470 align:start position:0%
was coming from thank you um
representative

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
leus so do you see having the
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
pediatrician on there more as a um
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
gathering information like for
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
pediatricians in general to go from the
 
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
committee back to the community more
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
that than the pediatrician giving input
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
to the community to the committee yes
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
exactly and that's why I think important
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
for them to sit on there because I don't
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
I think we're missing that kind of Med
 
00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
toed link where if there are problems
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
the pediatricians just aren't hearing
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
about them and you know we've never I
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
mean the again like I can't I think that
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of the members do want to make
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
changes because many of them have come
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
out personally to testify for bills but
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
as a group we haven't necessarily put
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
forth even one initiative so I think it
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be unfair to say we haven't called
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
in a pediatrician I mean we haven't but
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
we also haven't done really any other
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
initiatives either that since I been on
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
it thank you represent dry thank you Mr
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming in uh this
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
um representative cordell's uh proposal
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
here do you feel like that trims this
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
down enough and does adding a clerk is
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
something that you have to choose along
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
with a chairperson solve the problem of
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
logistics thank you for the question so
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
I do believe that adding the clerk piece
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
in would also we do elect a chair and
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
that's been statutory I think if a clerk
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
were also to be elected that would
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
remove the piece that was took uh quite
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
of um heated debate um over the course
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
of several meetings and many emails I do
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
think that that would solve that problem
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
and it would be a fiscally responsible
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
way of doing it because somebody's
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
already there um and could just take the
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
me meeting minutes for free just like
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
follow uh I thought this was
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
it was it's one on your
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
Des so just to clarify it doesn't have
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
his name on it this was just handed out
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
to me so but is that what we're
 
00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
referring to is yes is this what we're
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
referring to yes okay and that does also
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
pieces when you introduced
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative the bill uh initially as
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
introduced it spoke to several things
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
one eliminate one of the correctional
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
facility people and two dealing with one
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
local Health provider period it didn't
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
mention anything about clerks it didn't
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
mention anything about some of the
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussed pedi pediatrician in fact
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
looking at pediatricians right now I'm
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
reading an article in the Wall Street
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
Journal just the other day there's only
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
one Pediatric Hospital that has a
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
pediatric department up north and that's
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock all the others do
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
not and so it's a rare bird that we're
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
trying to look for here uh but but going
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
back to this so that was your initial
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced approved by the
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
council not approved no it was I did
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
have some members ask me to put it in it
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
was prior to me being on there and
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's where um when some of these other
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
suggestions were made I did agree with
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
after sitting on the committee myself
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
and I do want to say um the reason that
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
word healthcare provider was put on
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
there before was in case it wasn't
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily an MD but it it was a an NP
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
or something and there are actually
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
several pediatricians that I'm
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
personally aware of that would be
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
honored to sit on the committee so um I
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think that it would be a
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
difficult position to fill and the
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
second question then I'll go over to you
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
represent pent um representer cordelli
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
has a number of changes within this
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
right here have those were those
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
discussed at all with the organization
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
last night no the zoom was not um
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
working properly at all so I wasn't able
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
to communicate with the group um R bbon
 
00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:02.359 align:start position:0%
um kind of did a bit of a as you know
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
suggested that it was going to be talked
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
about and there was a a poll kind of
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
done on the original pieces of it but I
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
I do want to say
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
that sometimes when you're too close to
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
an issue it's easy to say I don't want
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
these changes but it doesn't mean that
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's actually what's in the best
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
interest because is it functioning right
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
now no
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I think we've got to make some
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
changes so I you know we have to make
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
changes that are in the best interest of
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
the the kids receiving special ed
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
services and not based on our
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
personal um likes necessarily and I I
 
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:40.839 align:start position:0%
also want to say if you guys decided
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
that there should only be one rep on
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
there I would I'd be willing to give up
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
my seat because I feel that strongly
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
that this committee could do wonderful
 
00:43:49.359 --> 00:43:50.710 align:start position:0%
that this committee could do wonderful
things

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
and I hope that it can get back to the
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
spot where it will thank you
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative pel thank you I just
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back to the healthc care
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
provider comment and representative
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
Tanner had an amendment that was trying
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
to um require a more specialized
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
individual and I told you I would follow
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
up with our own local pediatrician and I
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
did and he thought that almost any
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
pediatrician would fit this bill because
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
they do deal with special needs children
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis so I just want to let
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
you know that I had followed up and done
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
my homework thank
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Allison but
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell is not here to to
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
speak to his Amendment but uh two of the
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
issues that jump out at me uh on the
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
amendment and then I'm the printing
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
they're in the middle of a page but it
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
takes one representative the disability
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
rights Center off the committee and one
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
representative of the parent information
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
center off the committee I would like to
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
know the rationale for uh his
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation but obviously he can't
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
speak because he's not here yeah so I
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
think part of the rationale was is that
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
again we don't have a majority of
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
parents and those are not required under
 
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
federal law those those pieces so if
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
those pieces were removed we would have
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
more we would have a higher percentage
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
of a parent majority we again we haven't
 
00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
met it since in in nine years at this
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
point when I went back and looked
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
through reports and we are we are
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
federally mandated to meet it and we
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
haven't and there have been posts in
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
groups and I think people have come in
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know tried out the committee and
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
seen that it's dysfunctional and not
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
returned that's cuz we follow up yes
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess then and I understand the
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
issue of we all do of 50% 51% parents on
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
here and so there's going to be some
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
juggling which is going on here uh it
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
would seem to me though that you have to
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
keep in mind where people are coming
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
from from organizations and what they
 
00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
bring to the the committee and the fact
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
is if you then got to find two more
 
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
parents then you weigh that sort of
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
thing I guess I'm I'm just I I'm
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
surprised at that those two
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
organizations Representatives have been
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
taken off that would be taken off the
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee under the amendment
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding full well that got to find
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
some more parents I I I do understand
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
that and I and I mean I I personally
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
very much so like and respect the
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
representatives from those and I you
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
know great people but I think at the
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
same time for the last nine years we've
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
been trying to they've been trying to
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
recruit more parents and haven't been
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
able to meet that so to just say recruit
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
more parents it's not working um we
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to do that so how are
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
we going to actually be able to comply
 
00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
with the federal law somebody has to
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
come off and it's it's going to have to
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
be pieces that are not federally
 
00:46:39.309 --> 00:46:39.319 align:start position:0%
required and I I would say like yes
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
somebody can come in and give
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
presentations and whatnot still it's not
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
that nobody would be able to participate
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
even and and still get that
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
same input thank you yes representative
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
Damon so I'm wondering if you could
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
offer some clarification I'm not sure it
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
was you who said it but someone in the
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
hearing this morning or the discussion
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
this morning that if you're a parent on
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
the committee but you're on the
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee filling a different role then
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
you don't count as a parent to meet the
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
51% Quorum do I have that
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
parent

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
so I think if you're coming from the
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
perspective of I'm here as a parent with
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability um I don't
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
think you can necessarily just say that
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
the other person is a parent because the
 
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
the Mandate is that they would be a
 
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
parent of a child with a disability not
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
parent I think I interpreted the pro
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead I think I interpreted the
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
prior comment to mean that they were a
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
parent of a child with a
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
disability thank you so is that federal
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
law that is saying folks who are on
 
00:47:55.079 --> 00:47:56.390 align:start position:0%
law that is saying folks who are on
appointed

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
for a role that is a non-parent role
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
it's um I think the way that it's worded
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
says something like the majority of the
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
members shall
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
be either parents of children with uh
 
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
disability or they should
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
themselves I think I think what we'll do
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
is because I I had had a talk with folks
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
upstairs in research earlier Jen's not
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
here today she's out of state at a
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
conference Jennifer 4 but I think this
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
is an issue we need to get an answer to
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
Is this specifically stated in federal
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
law or state law that you can't be here
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
as both um I think I think that's very
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
important I'm here because I'm a
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
grandparent and I could have gotten off
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
this position a long time ago but I have
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
a very vested interest in ensuring that
 
00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
those children are going to get the best
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
op opportunity for an education as
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
possible and I feel this is my little
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
way of helping so I can serve as both
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I often times tell you about the the
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
youngster the other day that was my
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
little Kindergarten kid was in the
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
thinking chair you remember that and and
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
so you know you had to think he made a
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
wrong choice so um I I think it's
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
important so we will get a specific
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
answer in that
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
one okay yes there we go hello
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
Rebecca welcome
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
Rebecca is from doe yes director of
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
Special Education Service I'm Rebecca
 
00:49:32.589 --> 00:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
fad I'm the state director of special
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
education so there is no rule federally
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
or state that says that you can't um
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
have a member as Caitlyn is a member who
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
is also considered a parent in other
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
states they do count parents towards
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
that they they would count Caitlyn
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
towards that number as for an example
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
they would say that yes you are a
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative but you're also a parent
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
and we count you towards the the parent
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
parent number in New Hampshire that is
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
not in our statute and it has not
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
previously been done um but there are
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
other states that do count those parents
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
towards that um parent
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
number very interesting representative
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
you all for um speaking today if parents
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
were counted if members such as
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
representative cutab who qualifies as
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
both were counted also as parents do you
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
know if the Quorum would have been met
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
previously I would have to clarify which
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
ones um would qualify I as a parent um
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn is open and says that she has a
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
child with a disability um I would have
 
00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
to check with all the other members and
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
see if they have children with
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities that would that would um
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
make them count okay thank you y do say
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
parent with disabilities or just plain
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
parent parent of a child disability just
 
00:50:44.829 --> 00:50:44.839 align:start position:0%
parent or parent of a child with a
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
disability of a child
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
with further questions of doe yes or rep
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent Ford thank you Mr
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
chair is there any provision
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
for thank you is there any provision for
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
support of people who volunteer as a
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
parent with a child so that they can
 
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
participate supported by someone to care
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
for the child while they're doing the
 
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.870 align:start position:0%
for the child while they're doing the
committee

00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
part there is nothing um that is in the
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
provision of the law that says that that
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be provided to them um and that's
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
not something that has been previous
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
done you have a lot more experience than
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
most everyone in the room so I'm going
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
to ask you is it likely that that would
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
be a beneficial thing to provide as a
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
resource um potentially it it depends on
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
the children of the individuals that are
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
in here um it depends on their medical
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
condition um I know many of the parents
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
have children who are medically fragile
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
so to put several children in one space
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
may not be the best choice so there's a
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
lot of factors that um would play into
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
that I I I think it would help but would
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
it be feasible is is more the I'm not
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
thinking of bringing him all into one
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
room for
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
sure I'm thinking of offsite yeah uh but
 
00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:11.559 align:start position:0%
that however it would be worked by the
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
people who know how to do these things
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm not one of them um but it it
 
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
just the idea occurred to me that if I
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
were such a parent I might be really
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
frightened the idea of leaving my child
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
in some unspecified care or whatever
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
that if that could be arranged then I
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
might feel Freer to contribute my
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
experience expertise whatever uh yeah to
 
00:52:38.839 --> 00:52:40.230 align:start position:0%
experience expertise whatever uh yeah to
the

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
discussion um there is remote
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
participation allowed it was previously
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
allowed for there the majority had to be
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
in person and then you could have other
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
members participating remotely so there
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
were parents who for child care reasons
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh did participate remotely and now
 
00:52:59.309 --> 00:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh with the law that uh changed and was
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
in effect I believe two days ago only
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
onethird have to be in person and if the
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
others needed to be home for childcare
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
reasons they could participate remotely
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
on Zoom yeah so I think that kind of
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
does solve a little bit of that problem
 
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
I think we've all had a long-term lesson
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
in Zoom that we would rather not have
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
been afflict inflicted upon us but uh
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of us came out with a more
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
positive experience than others but I've
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
had all of those I want to have and uh
 
00:53:32.589 --> 00:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
so that said uh yes and thank you thank
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions yes
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
represent Damon then
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
caner go
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
ahead separately from the parts we've
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
been discussing in representative
 
00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:45.589 align:start position:0%
been discussing in representative
cordell's

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
cordell's
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
proposal the two members of the house
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the reduced to one member of the
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
Senate he's removed that they be members
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
of Education committee
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
I would Express a preference for one of
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
the two members of the house to be a
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
member of Education
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
committee I think we need the liais on
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
the communication back and forth um and
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful to have
 
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.430 align:start position:0%
that that would be helpful to have
represent

00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner I just um I was looking at that
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
first line of the group of parents and
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
it uh it says individuals with
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities or parents of children with
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities appointed by the governor
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
um and so my question is it it could
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
could be just a person with uh
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities not necessarily a
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
parent If there really dision it could
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
be a child of a um which is under the
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
age of 26 is how it's defined so it
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
could be a child with a disability um as
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
defined by the law yes well but even you
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
have you have another listing of a a CH
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
of child with disabilities but this is
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
in um you know the first line where it
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
says individuals with disabilities or
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
parents of children with disabilities
 
00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor so I'm I'm
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
just wondering if if an individual with
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
disabilities not necessarily a parent at
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
that point would count for the Quorum
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
yes yes and the other thing is is there
 
00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:14.549 align:start position:0%
yes yes and the other thing is is there
an

00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
issue with the appointment by the
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
governor is that anything that's holding
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
up for people coming on no is not okay
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
pen thank you I have a question for you
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and then I have a followup can
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
you repeat how many um pieces of
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
legislation we have coming across our
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
desk 09 109 just from the house side
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct and follow it we'll have
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
more I would suggest
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
that most a lot of most a good portion
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
of that legislation did not come from
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
members of our committee and that there
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be that there must be a
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
significant number of members of the
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
house who are very interested and have a
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
vested interest in education including
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
special needs so I am pretty sure the
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
speaker could find one member of the
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
House outside of the education committee
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
who would be more than
 
00:56:11.950 --> 00:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
happy representative cab as an as a
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
perfect example to serve on this
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
committee so I don't see why it would
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
have to be somebody from the education
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
committee that's just further further
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
discussion um so from the Department
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
does the department see the strikeouts
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
that representative cordelli has as
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
being uh uh bettering the that Council
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
or going the opposite direction One
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
represent of a disability rights Center
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
one represent of a parent information
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
center those would be
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
eliminated so we wouldn't take a stand
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
on whether it would make it better or
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
worse um I think that it makes it
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
closely more closely aligned to the
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
federal language um and it also takes
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
into that consideration that we have not
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
been able to get that 51% for parents
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
okay so I understand the reasoning
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
behind it I don't know if it would be
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
better or worse or I would not want to
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
speak to that so I think it just would
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
fed more align it with the federal
 
00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.230 align:start position:0%
fed more align it with the federal
language

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
further yes rson Cel so overall and I
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a question in here
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
but I just have to make a comment just
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
hearing all of this it becomes quite
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
obvious the dysfunctionality of this
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee and um it's hard for me to
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
even understand what it does uh we're
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
talking all about all these different
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
people and different categories and
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
parents but I just wanted to get out
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
there that I agree that this idea that
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
in a sense you could uh double dip and
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
reach this Quorum of the parents being
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
51% by having people who you know
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
hypothetically it seems to me that one
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
of the things that makes it
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional and unwieldy is the number
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
of people on the committee
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetically let's just say you could
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
find parents with children with
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities in every single one of
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
these categories I'm not saying you can
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
and you shouldn't leave out people who
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
might be qualified otherwise but um to
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
to have a concerted effort to do that I
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
important I just want to make a comment
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
I guess there's no question in that but
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
but I think it's a very important issue
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
this idea of is it okay for this sort of
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
double dipping to meet the
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
requirements represent leus if it's a is
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
it a question for I know what I was
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
going to say is when we're done here can
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
we have these two ladies come back up
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
sure we'll take all the technical
 
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
support we can get
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
here so you don't have a question
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else have a question
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
for thank you very much there is also a
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
parent um from the committee here as
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
well so if if we're letting people speak
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
just to be fair I just wanted to point
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
much Karen and Bonnie you willing to
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.029 align:start position:0%
 
forth

00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
you so now that we've been discussing as
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
somebody referred to it as double
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
dipping and you know a number presumably
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
a number of the people on the committee
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
do you think that if we just added in
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
that it could count you know they could
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
count for both that that would solve the
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
numerical issues you're
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
having it would certainly
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
help um I know of several people um the
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
right now the representative from parent
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
information center is a parent um at
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
least one of the parent with a child of
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
a child with a disability um at least
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
one of the um Educators or
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
administrators I believe has been a
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
surrogate parent um may still I believe
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
still is but I'm not positive and a
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
surrogate parent is in the definition of
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
a parent um an educational surrogate
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
parent so I don't know if it would
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
completely solve it because I don't have
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
all of the numbers in my head that quite
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
a few people have been appointed and the
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
governor didn't appoint anybody for two
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
years and so that it was
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult for a while we only had
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
one member who was
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
actively um eligible because everybody
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
else's term had
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
expired yeah I I think I I think we
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
would need more information enough if
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
that solves the issue but I think it I
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
think the committee really ought to
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
consider how really Monumental the
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
change in the law is and and the you
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
know that will allow more remote
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
participation the last couple of years I
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
I mean I was on this SEC it was very
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
difficult because we could not achieve a
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
quorum and because of that we could not
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
get we could not further the mission of
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
the sack or or really because we just
 
01:00:51.549 --> 01:00:51.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything because we could
 
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:54.799 align:start position:0%
not achieve 51% in person and
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
participation of our
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
members and um so you know I I think you
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
know that made the organization not able
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
to function I was on this sack I've been
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
on it for Bonnie probably knows she's an
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
incredible historian at least 10 years
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
you have since dick left right and and
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
there were many years when our
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees met where we made
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations on we spent a lot of
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
time um on a subcommittee on the rules
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
for the education of children and youth
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and came up with a
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
recommendation for kind of a changes in
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
our rules that um was a really a
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
collaborative um effort that the entire
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
that there was a subcommittee and then
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
the entire um committee voted on and
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
these had to do with preserving rights
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
for parents to be active participants in
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
decisions involving their children so it
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
retained rights for parents to get
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
information like for example um reports
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
that were done on evaluations 3 days
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
before a meeting so that they but have
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to review them to things
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
like that to be able at certain notices
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
and retaining time frames for decisions
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
to be made and for parents to be
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
notified in meetings so I think this and
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
that was really a a big effort that the
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
sack undertook and completed and as a
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
result I think our rules are in pretty
 
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
good shape when it comes to providing
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities for parents to be equal
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
participants in decisions that involve
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
their children's education so I
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the the past couple
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
years pandemic wre Havoc with a lot of
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
work that our committee attempted to
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
accomplish it made wreaked havoc on
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
public education right but hopefully
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
we're coming out from the other end of
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we now have you know more support
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
for some remote participation which
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
should help us to recruit and retain um
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
parents others with disabilities who
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
have a more challenging time
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
participating in meetings in person we
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
have new leadership that just started
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and we had a really
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
productive meeting we were and I think
 
01:02:59.549 --> 01:02:59.559 align:start position:0%
that we're on a good path um but the you
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
know the the co really wreaked havoc
 
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
with a lot of Nationwide New Hampshire
 
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
wide and this committee really suffered
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
as a result but I don't I think that
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's not really about the numbers so
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
much we need to make our parent majority
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
it really has to do with making sure
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
that we can meet our Quorum that we can
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
collaborate and get our job done and I
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
think we can do that now that we've um
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
returned to whatever normal is
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
but can can I add an explanation of why
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
parent information center and
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights Center were added
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
and kept when Senator Styles reviewed
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
that committee and it was
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
because in talking about the unmet needs
 
01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
of children with disabilities no one
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
ever calls pick or DRC when their needs
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
are being met we only hear about the
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
unmet needs of parents of children with
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities all disabilities throughout
 
01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
the state birth to 26 the entire range
 
01:03:59.069 --> 01:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
of Ages and disabilities and Geographic
 
01:04:02.269 --> 01:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
um ranges of the of the state um and so
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
we're able to bring that perspective of
 
01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
what we are hearing as unmet needs to
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
the committee as well I mean really
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of the inquiries to our
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
office involve education for children
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
with disabilities it's a 100% 100% of
 
01:04:16.079 --> 01:04:18.390 align:start position:0%
with disabilities it's a 100% 100% of
yours

01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
yours
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
obviously other questions here yes
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell so you would see that
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
position that should remain as part of
 
01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
the committee not be taken out yes both
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
of them or one of both both should
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
remain in do different things
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
Tanner and kind of a followup with uh
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell's um thoughts as
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
you look through this
 
01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation um H and and you said I
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
think you said that you would like to
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
see you know that the Quorum be is an
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
issue so if we go down through and I
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have a copy of the you
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy of the things but but
 
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
whether we could go down through and see
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
if um you could point out which ones
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
that you think should be I mean I don't
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
think the quarum is an issue anymore we
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
had an in-person quarum at our meeting
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
last night and um without even having to
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know we had a few people
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
participating remotely but most people
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
were in person
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that with the change in the
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
law that we're not going to have the
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
quarm isn't going to be as much of an
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
issue I think what we what we really
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
need um going forward is to try to
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
address the issue of having enough
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
parent represent parents of students
 
01:05:44.109 --> 01:05:44.119 align:start position:0%
with disabilities people with
 
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:45.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities and students with
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities on the committee I think
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
that the change in the law will help
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
that because it will allow people
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
geographically and with other kinds of
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
challenges to participate so it's at
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
this point I think
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's I mean never say like it's perfect
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
but I think the quarum issue is not so
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
much of a problem now we're not in the
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
midst of a pandemic that is requiring
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
people to stay home and we know that
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
people can participate remotely it's
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
more that the issue really is the 51%
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
issue and I think that the change in the
 
01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
law is going to help us to recruit
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
parents and others just follow up on
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
that so so let me just um so one of the
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
issues was to add a health care person
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
and I noticed on this it said one local
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
health care provider um are you in favor
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
of that or not not I'm not because why
 
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
create a you know a parent participation
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
issue where we don't need to and I think
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
that this committee has been able to
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
secure outside Consultants when needed
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the time I've been there we've had
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
lots of outside people come in and
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
present to our committee on issues that
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
the committee is interested in examining
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
and and um if if we had an amendment
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
about uh allowing people to count as
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
both uh would that help you
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
out I I think it would be helpful I
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't know I can't speak for the
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee but it would address the
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
numbers issue and recognize that people
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
can be both state employees for example
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
but also parents of students with
 
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
disabilities and see through that lens
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
as well because I think the idea is to
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that the views of parents and
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities who are
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
benefiting from the services or
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
navigating the education process are
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
represented on the committee so I don't
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
know that because you wear more than one
 
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
hat that would preclude you from being
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
able to view through that lens and and
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
do you um also I think you did before
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
say uh it wasn't a big deal to go from
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
two senators down to one
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
as long as I've been on the committee
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
which like I said Bonnie knows longer
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
than me I think I remember Senator Khan
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
being probably the last senator who was
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
actively involved and appointed I don't
 
01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
know that anyone's been appointed since
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Khan
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
and okay so going down to one Senator is
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
not gonna change anything I just wanted
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
to get I wanted to get clear what
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
changes you were advocating for we're
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
very fortunate to get one Senator on any
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
kind of commit I look the keep shortage
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
committee and we have one showing up and
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
that happens to be you know the chair of
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
Senate Ed who really has a
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be there uh so but I I
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
can't remember when I was on there of
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
course why a lot of reps didn't go that
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
time is you were scheduling on Thursday
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
afternoon at 4:00 and we were always in
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
session right and so we just couldn't
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
escape to drive across town to get there
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
so but uh senators I I don't think
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
they'd mind if we turned it down put it
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
back to one I think they'd jump up and
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
say thank
 
01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
you oh Senator Styles came oh Nancy came
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
sure yes she did and she was very active
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
in that and but she was also you know a
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee of the education
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
committee right so there
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's so taking a straw vote here with
 
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
people right here how many folks you
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
know this just straw vote you can change
 
01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
your mind later at this time how many
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
people are thinking that we ought to go
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
from two to one
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
Senator see there's where we are so I
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there needs to be any more
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
discussion on that point um now how many
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
people feel that we should have uh two
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
members continue from the from the house
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
to continue two members I do in one one
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
education and I I will support that well
 
01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:50.199 align:start position:0%
and that that was going to be my next
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
question should we be eradicating
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
education committee or should we just
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
leave leave it there I the way it is I
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
think you need to leave two members of
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate education two members of the
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
House Education committee or rework it
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
so at least one member from the house is
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
from the education committee and the
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
senator can be from any
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee valer you have hand yeah is it
 
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
possible to write a member of the house
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
but a preference for the education
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee I think we'd be wise to
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
produce something if we're going to
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
still have two
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
members one two members in the house of
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
which one must be from the education
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee that's the way most language
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
is written how many people would be up
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
for that latter part where of which one
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
must be from the education committee two
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
members of which one so we have a
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
majority there okay so we've gotten a
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
couple things some resolve there there's
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
another area where we have one local
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
education official and I always have a
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
question because local is in this bill
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
several places what is the definition of
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
local wondered that
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
too and and so um you know are we
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
looking for an administrator an
 
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
education education administrator um um
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
and is that the same thing
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative cascaden is your
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
education director in the school
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
district I don't think
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
so no it seems like the term
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
was I I think of it as an Lea you know
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
local educational administrator who can
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
sign off get of in some meetings but
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
never heard it local educational
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
official yeah for an administrator I
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
mean you're already having
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
um a specialed
 
01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.470 align:start position:0%
um a specialed
teacher

01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
um but it wouldn't hurt to instead of
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
two teachers having a special ed teacher
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
and a special ed administrator see we
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
also have other areas where we've added
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
in one local Health
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.310 align:start position:0%
in one local Health
provider

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay Rebecca welcome
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
back so the
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
um right so the administrator um is
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
typically a special education
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
administrator or a special ed director
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's who we've typically put on right
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
now there's currently a special
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
education director who fulfills that
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
role does that answer the question and
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
that comes from Jane's Organization no
 
01:12:19.149 --> 01:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
it does not that's an old the language
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
about it coming from NASA is old
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
language it is just somebody that um
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
expresses interest we usually put it out
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
to the field and say we're looking for
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
somebody um and then it goes through the
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the governor's office
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
person so where where are we on as a
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
group right here on one local education
 
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
official who shall be an administrator
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%

01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
administrators represent Amon thank you
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
could one or all of you weigh in on on
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
the proposal here that position is
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
omitted is it do do you want there to be
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
this local special ed director or other
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
administrator included you need
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
administrators idea is plural If you
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
eliminate that you have one
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
administrator so on here line
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
f is one and is crossed talk you're also
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
referring to another line idba says
 
01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
administrat of programs for children
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
with disabilities so there and then line
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
um L is one administrator for special
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
education public special education
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
program so there's one that is a local
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
education official and then one that's a
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
administrative that's how we meet the
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
follow I think that it's not what we
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
want it's what the Federal Law requires
 
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
so the Federal Law requires more than
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
one so we
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
can't um I lost my place here sorry we
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
can't remove line F and be in compliance
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
with federal law because we'd only have
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
one administrator and we're supposed to
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
have more than one right same with the
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
teachers it's plural you can't eliminate
 
01:14:02.199 --> 01:14:04.189 align:start position:0%
teachers it's plural you can't eliminate
one

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
one
ah

01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
so may I yes go ahead so then you just
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
referenced line G where the proposal is
 
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
to reduce two to one and that would make
 
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
it not compliant with federal law right
 
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.110 align:start position:0%
it not compliant with federal law right
thank

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
you represent parel yeah I just want to
 
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
make one point um
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
for parents with typical healthy
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
children it can be really challenging to
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
come to to attend a meeting and Conquer
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
and find child care so that would be
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
addressing representative Ford's comment
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
and I know Zoom is this new wonderful
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
technology that we've all discovered but
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
um I just want you to keep in mind
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
that even with typical healthy children
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
a parent who might be trying to attend a
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting can have you don't know
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen behind you while
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
you're trying to be on that Zoom meeting
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
and trying to maybe watch your children
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
and pay attention while you're on the
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
zoom meeting will be challenging so I
 
01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine um parents of special
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
needs children who have even more issues
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
that might pop up would also find even
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
Zoom meetings difficult to attend so I
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
just want to make that point that it
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
might still be just as challenging
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
reaching that per parental
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
Quorum we haven't really recruited
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
parent information center and DRC have
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
typically put the word out looking for
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
parents and I don't know about DRC but
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
parent information center hasn't done
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
that in the past few years because there
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a point to doing it since
 
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
they couldn't they couldn't come in
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
person when during the the pandemic and
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
so that can that can happen again which
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
would increase the numbers certainly it
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
always has yeah I mean you make a really
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
good point it is challenging I mean one
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
thing that might be considered I think
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
it was representative Ford who talked
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
about like a child care subsidy as
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
something that would really support um
 
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
parents ability to attend um and and you
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
know I think I think I'm where I'm where
 
01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
you are representative for it it's like
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
Zoom like you know I mean I think you
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
almost use the term Affliction it is
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
something that I mean it is a really
 
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
great tool it is going to be really
 
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
helpful I think for parents who with or
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
without child care who are wanting to
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
participate but live in Berlin and just
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be able to do it to be
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
so we I think it will help us with
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
geographical diversity and recruiting
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
but we could consider further supports
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
for parents in terms of um some kind of
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
Child Care Subsidy I think in the past
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
parents I don't know if this is still
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
happening um Rebecca fet would know but
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
parents were at least given some
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation reimbursement I don't
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
know if that's still being made
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
available to parents but if there are
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
ways that this committee could um
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
recommend supports for to enable and
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
facilitate parent representation that be
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
okay I want to just walk through a few
 
01:16:59.229 --> 01:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
other points here that we might want to
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
consider are we all in favor of asking
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
Rebecca to find those states that allow
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
a person to be there in two capacities
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
one as a parent and Rebecca could you
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
try to find that for us I don't have Jen
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
right here she won't be back for another
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
week so if you could find that out maybe
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
direct us a little bit or even craft
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
something yourself to to enable that to
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
occur I think that might get us over one
 
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
of our hurdles here thank
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
you all right so obviously we're not
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
going to get you know something done
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
here today and we have a number of bills
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
but I think we've really delved into
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
this so we can come up with something
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other critical points in
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
that we we should be looking at and
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
thinking of of mending language we
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
didn't really really resolve the issue
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
of one local care provider um maybe we
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
should take a straw vote on that whether
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
or how we should do that you know
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
there's technical support available
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
there's also right here and your your
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
language that you have near Bill Linda
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
represented Tanner is much more specific
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
than that which we see coming forward in
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
147 um you're talking about you know
 
01:18:22.679 --> 01:18:23.709 align:start position:0%
147 um you're talking about you know
have

01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
uh practiced in these particular areas
 
01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:29.199 align:start position:0%
are you getting too narrow it's going to
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
be difficult to find the Beast well we
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
also talked about maybe opening it up um
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
when that Amendment came through for
 
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
phys Physicians assistance uh that may
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
be working with children as well um so I
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I definitely think that that bill
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
was too narrow and but I'd also like to
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
just go down on the other letters um
 
01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
well can we just stick to this one for a
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
second do we want to see something in
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
there referencing Health a new position
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
with a health provider of some sort ref
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
I think they said they felt comfortable
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
with not having theye it's up to us
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
though rewrite rewrite statute but we
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
rely on the people on the committee
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely but you know
 
01:19:15.070 --> 01:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
I we're goingon to have to resolve that
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
one way or the other representative
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
casad I see more value in keeping that
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
um DRC and the parent information center
 
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
than do a healthare provider okay repres
 
01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
leus um it seems that the health care
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
provider is there for information going
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
the other way if they need information
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
on a spec of a specific technical they
 
01:19:41.229 --> 01:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
can ask that person to come in but the
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
health provider was to get the
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
information from this committee out
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
to pediatricians and the general
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
Community having to do with health and I
 
01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
can see that that would be a useful
 
01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
thing because I don't see another way
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
another means of communication like we
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
want to keep somebody from the Ed
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee on this so that they can come
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
back and talk to us so I can see having
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
a and it just the amendment says health
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
care provider so that would include your
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner whatever it's more
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
generic um so that they can see what the
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
issues are and bring them back to their
 
01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:23.350 align:start position:0%
issues are and bring them back to their
community

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
being yes represent cordal I see it as
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
an advantage also to have a health care
 
01:20:38.189 --> 01:20:38.199 align:start position:0%
provider right on this uh committee um
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
what we've been talking about this whole
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
time is how dysfunctional this committee
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
is and how it doesn't work so maybe this
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
is one of the problems you say you can
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
call in experts and that seems to be
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
complicated um if you had someone right
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
on board who was familiar with uh
 
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
Healthcare in some way whether whether
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
it be a pediatrician or you could open
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
it up you know a physician's assistant
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
someone who would have some expertise in
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
that area would
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
bring that to the committee itself I
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
think that would be a
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
plus repres
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
for I'd just like to bring us all back
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
to the real world the people you're
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
talking about are not people who like
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and committees they have a job
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
they have so many hours to do it they
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
build by the hour
 
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
they move the patients through as
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as they can and they don't
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
have time in their professional lives to
 
01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
sit on a committee that wants to talk
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
the issue to death and we're all guilty
 
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:37.950 align:start position:0%
the issue to death and we're all guilty
of

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we've sat in those committees we
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
participated we know who we are but they
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't have time for that they want to
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
see a problem they want to diagnose it
 
01:21:51.709 --> 01:21:51.719 align:start position:0%
and they want you to do it and if really
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to disseminate we can
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
disseminate they just have to tell us
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
what to
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
disseminate we can hire them to do that
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
by the hour it'll be a lot cheaper and
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
they'll be more willing to
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
work and then we handle dis semination
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's my two
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
sets Okay
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
so take a a straw pull on this one right
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
here this this health provider language
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
could could they it does the person that
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
comes in from Health and Human
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
Services uh I'm talking about line H one
 
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Department of Health
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
involved in financing or delivery of
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
special education or related services to
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities would that
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
person have a line with uh health
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
providers that might be able to make a
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation or get the technical
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
support for you from Bonnie
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
orhs I mean that's not what their role
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
is if they if I mean if they might be a
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
good contact if we needed to to talk to
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
someone from like special medical
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
services for example which would be a
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
state agency Person Medical person who
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
could come in um they might be able to
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
facilitate that but it's not really
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
they're not a provider
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
Rebecca the representative for DHHS that
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
fulfills that role um works with the
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
residential facilities that we approve
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
as private providers of programs y thank
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
you okay so straw vot do we need to have
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
a health provider on the
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee put your hands up if you say
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
negative other words it's putting
 
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
negative other words it's putting
language

01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.870 align:start position:0%
language
in

01:23:35.870 --> 01:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
vo to strike out the need for one Health
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
provider as a member of the committee
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
not that you wouldn't have somebody
 
01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
there that's
 
01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
invited but as a member put your hand up
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
if you're against that when one two
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
three four five
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
six to not have a a voting member right
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
here that you got the line that's to
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill yes yes so raise your hand if you
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
want if that's how you see
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
want to delete to
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
delete yeah I can go either way too
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
however I think we can do it through a
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
different way one one two three four
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
five six seven
 
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
eight so there is a majority here saying
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
that but that's not going to you know
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to wait and see so that's
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
that question's still up in the
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
air all righty so is there anything else
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
we need to do at this point in time what
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
we do need to do is we need to get a
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment put together
 
01:24:59.470 --> 01:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
here um and we've addressed several
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
items here and there's we need to have
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
one more meeting here and we'll bring
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
some draft Amendment language in and
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
then when we have everybody here this
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
will be before the November meeting so
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to have one more on
 
01:25:13.199 --> 01:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to have one more on
this

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
Brill so um yes can we do a on not
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
Brill so um yes can we do a on not
deler

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah I that that would be uh
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
I I and J yeah it's not on my sheet here
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
of okay
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
opposed I I think I think we're going to
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
leave it now that's the way so there
 
01:25:49.149 --> 01:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
there are several things we've been able
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
to straw boo figure out get some common
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
ground we're getting there so we well
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting there and and that
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we want to do so we will
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
come back with some draft language is
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
there anybody would like to help craft
 
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
this draft Linda I know you've got your
 
01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
this draft Linda I know you've got your
hand

01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
up and represent Bon you want help too

some G put something together here with
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
the the draft that we've discussed and
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
Esto says yes and and then we'll capture
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
stuff the what the

01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
correction officers yeah let's have a
 
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
straw vote on that whether we keep both
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
Corrections folks in in so leave it as
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%

leaving it as it is in law right now the
 
01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
corrections the corrections are
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
so got State and the local County
 
01:26:53.159 --> 01:26:54.510 align:start position:0%

01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
two keeping two keeping the different
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
levels so one two 3 four
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
five six S 8 nine 10 yeah we'll keep
 
01:27:10.709 --> 01:27:10.719 align:start position:0%
that in we'll keep that in because we're
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
right at that point where we can you
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%

354 as everybody Might Recall 354 is
 
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
relative to Charter Public School
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for State Building state
 
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
School building
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
Aid and so with that we start looking at
 
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
19815 in
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
statute and uh try to meld in the
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
charter school building a program into
 
01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
charter school building a program into
that

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
legislation uh I'll remind folks that
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
there's we did some passage of the
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
school building aid process uh last year
 
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh Amy W us the title the number of the
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
bill can you recall that we just passed
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
the application
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
process 452 that's it was 452 which
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
changed statue around
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
significantly and with that it's now
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
impacting bills that we have
 
01:42:11.310 --> 01:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
retained and and and so and there's
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
other bills out there now looking at the
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
whole formula which and I've mentioned
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
it before that one will be coming in
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
Senate so I have put together an
 
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:24.830 align:start position:0%
Senate so I have put together an
amendment

01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
here based upon those changes which we
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
had made by
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
452 and with the attorney looking at
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
trying to craft around that trying to
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
meld it into current language in what is
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
law right
 
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
now and it was shared
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday with the charter school
 
01:42:49.470 --> 01:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
disillusion committee that's a committee
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
that looks at okay what what happens
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
when a charter school goes out of
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
business whether it be voluntarily or
 
01:42:58.750 --> 01:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
involuntarily it goes out what happens
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
for example with the liabilities what
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
happens with the building if its own
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
what happens to Student Records where
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
are they sent who handle soci Student
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
Records is it the resident District or
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
is it Department of
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
Education um and we've had that issue
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
come to us several times and and it's a
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
real concern so what this amendment does
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
and I I will show you just read through
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
some of the changes here and there's
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
already a few areas where it has to be
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
tweaked but going down on the first page
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
there does everybody have a copy Amy do
 
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
you have one was were there any extras
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
that came by there and there there's
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
lots of right here we have extras too
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
there what and
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
and here's here's a couple to take back
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
here okay in in Charter School law in
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
19815 what what this does is as the
 
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
original Bill did it says the local
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
student districts and Charter Public
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
Schools and Charter Public Schools has
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
been placed in all those locations
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
within law where we're speaking to
 
01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
building Aid going out for public school
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
schools or
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
public on line 21 there's language there
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
which speaks to and and this is not
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
about a leased facility lease is handled
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
differently so we're just dealing with
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
those buildings for construction and
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%

down um that's that's an exception you
 
01:46:04.589 --> 01:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
may not have to repay because you have
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
nothing left and there's going to be a
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
need to find out get some emergency

facility that's going to be functional
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's areas in law where the
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner needs that based on the
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
criteria set forth in our
 
01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
19815 U through 19815 W so you got to go
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
back and look at the statutes to make
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure it's everything's built that way uh
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
state board shall approve okay uh going
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%

eligible Grant shall be dispersed until
 
01:47:06.189 --> 01:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
the completion of the construction and

that's looked at and then on the last
 
01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
page there are some significant changes
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
starting in line

the state maybe having liability for a
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%

Bott
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
addressed an issue also the dissolution
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
charter school committee made a
 
01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation on uh one in the event of
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
a voluntary or involuntary dissolution
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
of a Charter Public School remaining
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%

Charter Public School shall be forwarded
 
01:49:08.589 --> 01:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
to Department of Education if all
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
records maintained by the Charter Public
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
School have not been forwarded to the
 
01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
residence and there has been since an
 
01:49:21.030 --> 01:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
amendment brought forward by uh
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli who's also on that
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee I we met
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh there is concern about um
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll just read what he has because I
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
just have what he sent me right here um
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
he says we have tried this four year
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
okay it be uh the data shall not be
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
disclosed by the testing entity to any
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
other person organization entity or
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
government or any component thereof
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
other than the parent or Guardian the
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
department school or School District
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
shall not be used by the testing entity
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
for any other purpose except as provided
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
in RSA 193c colon
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
12 um so it's trying to make sure that
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
the records which are sent from the
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School don't go anywhere
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
else other than to the the resident
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
District or
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
doe so those are the changes that have
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
been suggested through another committee
 
01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
so here we are and
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
legislation was put forth to try and
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
deal with some of this however it was
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
told to us we have a bill already in
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee dealing with much of this use
 
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
that bill as the bill to amend and
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's what we're having to do so that's
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
why it's in this bill right here at
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
354 open it up to
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent leas
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
okay I have questions about two areas
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
one of them is the shity bond and I will
 
01:50:59.870 --> 01:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
be honest I don't know enough about I
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand the purpose of shity bonds
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
but how much they actually
 
01:51:04.199 --> 01:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
but how much they actually
are

01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and if they had a shity bond if they
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
could come up with a shity
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
bond could they not come up with the
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
money to pay for the building I'm not
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
sure if I would like explanation about
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
how that works and where that money
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
comes from and does somebody just
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
voluntarily put it up to be gotten back
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully or you know where are they
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
getting this money for this charity Bond
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
if they don't have money to pay for
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
building the school that's my question I
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
guess I'll give you an example what we
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
had to do up in my community we you know
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
we have Highway block money it comes
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
from the state it's for roads and
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
Bridges and the money that goes to the
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
Woodsville fire district which has their
 
01:51:58.030 --> 01:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
own highway department has to pass
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
through the town from the state to town
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
to the district because they have their
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
by Statute their own uh highway
 
01:52:08.589 --> 01:52:08.599 align:start position:0%
department for the roads in that fire
 
01:52:10.350 --> 01:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
district the amount of the grant is
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere between $250,000 something
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
such that it's not a heck of a lot of
 
01:52:18.030 --> 01:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
money but in terms of Highways but the
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
town said to the fire district you're
 
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to put up a bond to ensure
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
that you're using this money for the
 
01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:26.350 align:start position:0%
that you're using this money for the
stated

01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
purpose and and the bond is a minimal
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
cost it's it's you're talking very
 
01:52:35.310 --> 01:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
little dollars for it but it's kind of
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
crazy you have to do something like that
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
because it's going from one government
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
agency through one to another government
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
agency but the law said that they had to
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
do that so it's it's Amy do you have
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
anything else that you might be able to
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
add to shity bonds it's not for the
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
whole amount that you're you're getting
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
If you're receiving for example um
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
something like this and a and a a chart
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
of public school is you know maybe reing
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
upwards towards maximum maybe a couple
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
hundred, a year if it's spread over a
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
bunch of years their their building
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
needs are not going to be as big as the
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
$70 million project the state's going to
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
have to cough up for
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
concrete I'm just it it's says it will
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
be there and it'll be used for repayment
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
in compliance with paragraph 3 and so my
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
question you know if it's going to be
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
used for repayment how can it be really
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
small but if it's going to be large
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
enough to be used for repayment then how
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
are they going to be able to afford
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
it yeah and you know it's it's
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
um I think we ought to have somebody
 
01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
come in that has that expertise to
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
explain that to us and and the amount of
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
the bond is not designated in this this
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
is just one of the Avenues which is
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
going down um some states have this
 
01:54:02.990 --> 01:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
written in one where we took this from
 
01:54:04.109 --> 01:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
was North
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
Carolina uh but they had several options
 
01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
available and there were other options
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
but the dis the committee that Senator
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
Lang has said no I prefer that we just
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
have one AB bonding and Sally fellow was
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
on it as well
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
um and so this is an area that I'm not
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to try to explain it we'll we'll
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
have to get people in I'm just giving
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
you an idea this is what may come at us
 
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and we may have to end up this is
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
really draft right you're seeing right
 
01:54:34.589 --> 01:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
there needs a lot of
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
work thank you and then my second
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
question is over
 
01:54:39.639 --> 01:54:41.830 align:start position:0%
question is over
here

01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
um 22 line 22 on page
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
two that they'll receive 5% the eligible
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
Grant each year for 20 years and there
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
was discussion of doing that for the
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
public schools and and we had decided
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
not to do that because it ends up making
 
01:55:02.669 --> 01:55:02.679 align:start position:0%
the public school pay a lot more in
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
interest Etc so I'm wondering why we're
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
doing it for can you come on up for a
 
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:11.669 align:start position:0%
doing it for can you come on up for a
second

01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
please you're you're the prime sponsor
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill and within the bill you had
 
01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.589 align:start position:0%
of this bill and within the bill you had
the

01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%

to ask a Amy Clark because I consulted
 
01:55:51.069 --> 01:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
with her on my drafting of this bill on
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
that very section so Amy Clark from the
 
01:55:56.750 --> 01:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
doe thank you yeah thank you so um
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
originally when this bill first came it
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
had the 80% upfront just like the public
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
schools did and there was a big concern
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
among the committee about dissolution
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
what if it goes Belly Up um and that's
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
what I call it Belly Up um and so the um
 
01:56:18.910 --> 01:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
the compromise was to say well we won't
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
give 80% upfront because that's a lot of
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
money and if the school can um pay that
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
over 5% each year over 20 years like the
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
old uh Public School infrastruct uh like
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
the old school building Aid formula then
 
01:56:33.069 --> 01:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
that would be a good compromise still
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
being eligible for building Aid yet
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
you're giving 5% each year it also for
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
me feels like I know that there is
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
concern for dissolution processes and
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
that probably it's a very valid concern
 
01:56:49.790 --> 01:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
but having that language there really
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
protects the state's investment because
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're only giving a one 12th of that
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
every year for 20 years uh and it it
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
seemed to address that problem so that's
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
what we added in there thank you and I
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
know that the reason why we put less
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
depreciation as represented fellows is
 
01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
also saying hey you know you depreciate
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
this facility or what Gatsby what uh
 
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's the federal stuff that over a
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
number of years the value of that dollar
 
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
is or the building is has gone down of
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
course so are you going to
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
be having to pay back the 5% 5% what you
 
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
put in over these years or or is it
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
going to be a depreciated amount of what
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
that value of that the money received
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
previously is now worth in in in regard
 
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
to the facility you know what I'm trying
 
01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:42.910 align:start position:0%
to the facility you know what I'm trying
to

01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
say um I I'm not sure but let me just
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
let me just say it's 5% of the award so
 
01:57:51.709 --> 01:57:51.719 align:start position:0%
the charter school is going to qualify
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
for 30% of the building Aid award it's
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
going to be determined that that is you
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
know $20 million uh whatever that um
 
01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
turns out to be and then we'll pay the
 
01:58:05.550 --> 01:58:05.560 align:start position:0%
state will pay $1 million for 20 years
 
01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh so it won't have anything to do with
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
the depreciation of the building but I
 
01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if that if that do you think
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's necessary that there be a sh Bond
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
or some kind of a I unfortunately I
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about shity
 
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
bones I've heard of them I guess what my
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
limited um you can confirm this
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
information I think you should but I
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
think that when you take out a bond it's
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
just a certain percentage like one or 3%
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
um of the project that um gives that but
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
again I'm sure if somebody's listening
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
there they might be shaking their head
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's all I'll say do you
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
know anything about that you were at the
 
01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
meeting okay okay okay all right yeah
 
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
represent leus yeah I'd like to follow
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
up on the 5%
 
01:58:54.870 --> 01:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
and it's 5% of the
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
30% and my question
 
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
is are they really gaining much
 
01:59:04.830 --> 01:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
considering have you figured out the in
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
extra interest that will have to be paid
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
if you're only paying at that amount and
 
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
what interest rate they're paying on
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
their loan and by doing it by 5% are you
 
01:59:17.199 --> 01:59:18.229 align:start position:0%
their loan and by doing it by 5% are you
really

01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:59:21.149 --> 01:59:21.159 align:start position:0%
losing a bunch of that money I mean have
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
you figured out what what the money's
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
actually come to by the time you look at
 
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
how much more interest they have to pay
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
by only doing that versus the amount
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
they're actually
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
getting I haven't R run any calculations
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
so probably would depend the amount the
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
um rates but we certainly could run a
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
simple calculation but you know interest
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
on a $20 million is a lot of money right
 
01:59:48.669 --> 01:59:48.679 align:start position:0%
over the course of the life of a bond
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money um it is the
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
old you know this is creates the tail
 
01:59:56.990 --> 01:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
like that is how we used to fund School
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
construction projects uh is that the
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
state would pay 30% of the principal um
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
on the bond they would they've never
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
covered interest cost is always picked
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
up by the local right but what I'm
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
wondering is if you drop it down to the
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
5% of the 30% if all you're do if if if
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
that all gets eaten up in the extra
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
interest that they end up paying and you
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
might as well not give them anything oh
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
I I it would not we I can run a
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
calculation it's not um a good portion
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
of the amount no it's not like if you're
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
getting $20 million from the state
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
certainly in so um for easier numbers
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
let's say I know this numbers don't
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
fully match but 30% in thir let's assume
 
02:00:41.390 --> 02:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
it was 33% because it's just easier if
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
they were had a $60 million project and
 
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
their award was $20 million they're
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to pay interest over that Bond
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
bond for $60 million all the way through
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
the 20year period that is going to
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
account for a substantial amount of
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
interest but it's not going to be 30% of
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
that 5% of 30% no it's um five so it's
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
um we make 20 payments so it's only 5%
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
because um it's five times 20 is 100% so
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
we're giving them 100% of the award
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
right so their award is calculated at
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
30% 100% of their award will be $20
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
million at the end of 20 years they're
 
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
going to get that full $ 20 million it's
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
just that we're going to fraction it out
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay 12th the first year
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
12th the second year 12th the third year
 
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
all the way to 20 years until they have
 
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
all of their money I got I got that but
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to be paying a lot more
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
interest because they were because they
 
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
now had to take out a much bigger loan
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
than they would have had to take out if
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
you paid it up front like we do with the
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
public school absolutely they will
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
definitely have why I'm wondering how
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
that how much they're losing by doing it
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
this way that's my question right yes
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
definitely more interest for sure
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt taking that out and not
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting your full amount you're going to
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
be paying whatever your interest rate is
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
on your bond you're be paying that um
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
paying it down so it is much more
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
beneficial to get 80% up front but it
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't deter a school we can run those
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
numbers but I just want to be clear that
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
interest is not the full amount of the
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
award it's not even close but we'll get
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
those numbers thank
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
you that's exactly why we went to 80% to
 
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
take the interest off the communities
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
but what it did do it restricts the
 
02:02:38.430 --> 02:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
number of app grants which because
 
02:02:41.229 --> 02:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
you're paying it all out front of that
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
$50 million you have appropriated that
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
year which we only had half that amount
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
because of debt you you could only award
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
it to so many schools and and there is a
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion I've heard it from
 
02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
folks sitting to my right here that if
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
we only paid out 40% or something
 
02:03:04.069 --> 02:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
initially we could might be have enough
 
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
list it's going to have to make sense to
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
do something here because we have 17
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
schools remember that put in for
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
applications here that were on your list
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
we approved three of which one was not
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
approved by the
 
02:03:32.830 --> 02:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
community and the others that are not
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
being receiving money have had to put
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
all this outlay out for their
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
engineering design their plans Etc and
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
they there's no predictability when they
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
might get an application approved they
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
may never see the gain from that money
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
isn't that why we're going to the pay
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
everybody a certain amount per year and
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
deal with that's the thought of one of
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
the bills coming forward but believe me
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is a very complex type
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
issue that is going
 
02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
to require a lot of discussion and with
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
109 bills coming here I don't know how
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're ever going to have the time to do
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
it you know are they going to have we're
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
going to use this is Amy still going to
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
have to approve for Life Safety health
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
and all the criteria we have for the
 
02:04:20.510 --> 02:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
design of a building or is that going to
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
be up to the locals to do what do what
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
they do with that money when can they
 
02:04:26.669 --> 02:04:26.679 align:start position:0%
access this money who holds the money
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
the state or the local who gets the
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
interest on that money being held the
 
02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
treasury or the
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
local can I also just put uh uh just be
 
02:04:39.310 --> 02:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned a different
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
process I just want people to remember
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
that this house bill 452 just passed in
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
July so when people talk about problems
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
with building Aid this bill that passed
 
02:04:57.149 --> 02:04:57.159 align:start position:0%
um um drastically improves the process
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
and um I'm excited about the process
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
because it got rid of a lot of uh
 
02:05:03.310 --> 02:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
difficulties with that process there's
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
still a funding issue so don't get me
 
02:05:08.350 --> 02:05:08.360 align:start position:0%
wrong but um but the bill that you've
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
amended here um seems to work if that
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
does change to 80% it it was amended
 
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
with the changes from 452 correct yes
 
02:05:19.709 --> 02:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
that's why I took so we just I just got
 
02:05:22.510 --> 02:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
this handed to me this morning Jeff over
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
there said this is a devil of a time
 
02:05:26.910 --> 02:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
doing this because you know a lot of the
 
02:05:29.709 --> 02:05:29.719 align:start position:0%
new changes have just been posted on
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
their online for them to access to make
 
02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
these changes it was just posted this
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
last week
 
02:05:35.639 --> 02:05:37.669 align:start position:0%
last week
right

02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah representa Ellison then uh thank
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh I'm referring to page
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
five lines 35 to 37 uh and I just if
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
somebody could give me some sort of
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
information uh on how this would really
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
work it says projects that did not
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
receive approval from the state's
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
District's legislative body or the Char
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
school public school trustees May submit
 
02:06:04.189 --> 02:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
resubmit those
 
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
projects I'm trying to figure out how
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
this might work if if a local school
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
board does not approve an
 
02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
application to be sent forward it
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
appears to me that somehow that
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
application even though the School Board
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
didn't approve it could be resubmitted I
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who would re who would
 
02:06:26.589 --> 02:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
resubmit the application in that in that
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
case Amy can you explain what happened
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
with Co
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
Brook um well just in general terms um
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
because that wasn't the school board
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
that was the voters uh but the in
 
02:06:40.549 --> 02:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
general terms I think that
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
um there's when you apply for building
 
02:06:47.069 --> 02:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
Aid you submit a uh part of your
 
02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
application that says the school board
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
um wants the district to submit that
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
they approve they're on board with the
 
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
school the school district and
 
02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's on board uh and so if that
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
works out they might get funding if they
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
don't then the following year they um
 
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
are still going to be on that list and
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
so we just want to make sure that the
 
02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
school board is still in favor of
 
02:07:14.750 --> 02:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
keeping the project on the list and if
 
02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:18.040 align:start position:0%
they don't uh the school board does not
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
agree then they get booted off the list
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't prevent them from ever
 
02:07:27.229 --> 02:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
apply reapplying again okay so is C
 
02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
Brook back on the they rejected it the
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
town rejected that was not the school
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
board that rejected it was the town
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
correct so the and we we are we're
 
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
looking at applications being submitted
 
02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
annually now not by
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
annually so in the next
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
bium Cobra could come back correct
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
colber has applied for building Aid
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
their school board supported them their
 
02:07:56.589 --> 02:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
application for a set amount of dollars
 
02:07:58.990 --> 02:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
they have to site the amount of that the
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
project um is in their minutes um they
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
have not told us they're not interested
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
in the project so they'll remain on the
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
list until they don't um unless right so
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
I guess that will be the short answer to
 
02:08:15.629 --> 02:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
that how long do they remain on the list
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh so they'll remain on the list um so
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
they'll remain on the list until we have
 
02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
money to give them um and then their
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
voters approve the if we have if the
 
02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:30.079 align:start position:0%
state has funds to give a school
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
district um
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
money let me back up if the state
 
02:08:37.470 --> 02:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't offer the school district money
 
02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
they'll stay on the list until we can
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
offer them money as long as their school
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
board says that they're still okay with
 
02:08:44.589 --> 02:08:44.599 align:start position:0%
it they'll continue to stay on the list
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
because the state has never offered them
 
02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
an award once the state has offered them
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
an award our draft regulations anyway
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
that are still going with this new
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
process will allow them to hold on to
 
02:08:58.589 --> 02:08:58.599 align:start position:0%
that award three time three voting
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
Cycles before their voters would have to
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
reject it three times and then they
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
would get booted off the list and have
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
to reapply that I didn't know that part
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
and and it does seem like that that um
 
02:09:10.109 --> 02:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
somewhat makes sense because there's
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
usually something significantly wrong
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
with the project that needs to be be
 
02:09:16.990 --> 02:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
reworked with the community for them to
 
02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
understand so you do get off the list if
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
your voters are not supportive of your
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
project um you also get off the list if
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
your project substantially changes so
 
02:09:27.669 --> 02:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately your voters could say no
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
and then you have to go back to the
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
drawing board and come up with a
 
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
different project then that also if it's
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
not substantially the same also falls
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:41.310 --> 02:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
list followup uh let me get this clear
 
02:09:44.669 --> 02:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
then if if the uh if they're on the list
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
they don't withdraw from the list and
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to stay on the list until
 
02:09:52.589 --> 02:09:52.599 align:start position:0%
or they get State they get State money
 
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
is that that's basically what you're
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
saying or through a cycle anyway correct
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
so there be no need for the school board
 
02:10:00.069 --> 02:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
to resubmit an application because
 
02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're already approved and on the list
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
or approved to be on the list correct
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
correct thank you correct we'll have
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
some um we have some process to submit
 
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
um a way to update the um costs in that
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
application because you could be sitting
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
on that list for a while and every year
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
we'll ask for the school board
 
02:10:21.629 --> 02:10:21.639 align:start position:0%
to send a letter that they still want to
 
02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
be on the list but the application
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
itself just remains in
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
house further
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative dry thank
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
you very much um can you just clarify
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
for me if some school is kind of
 
02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
treading water and staying on the list
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
how does that affect dispersement to
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
other schools like could another school
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
get on the list also is it Like An
 
02:10:48.350 --> 02:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
accounts payable that we have to have
 
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
out there that's always going to be
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
year um can you say that again um yeah
 
02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
if if if a if a disqual um rejected by
 
02:11:06.189 --> 02:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
the voters or School District's approval
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh project is still on the list every
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
year until that it comes up is it does
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
that affect the amount that's available
 
02:11:17.149 --> 02:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
to give to other schools the next go
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
around so um yes and no so um you're not
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
in this new one big correction with this
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
uh bill which is excellent is now when
 
02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
we offer an award we have actually that
 
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
is from money that's already been
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated therefore schools are not
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what the state does so we
 
02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
hand them a letter saying that we have
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
money for you um you can now go to your
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
voters and ask to see if they want to
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
approve the project um in that case that
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
money is tied up because were waiting to
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
see if the voters approve the project so
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
if the voters don't approve that project
 
02:11:55.790 --> 02:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
that money is still tied up for up to
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
three year three voting Cycles um with
 
02:12:00.109 --> 02:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
that particular project for that
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
particular project and if they then say
 
02:12:07.149 --> 02:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
no three times or or yeah so if they the
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
voters then say no three times they'll
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
get booted off that list and that money
 
02:12:12.669 --> 02:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
has not been sent spent we haven't
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
actually given them the money yet we
 
02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
won't do that until the voters pass the
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
project and do some other things uh
 
02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
a a fair amount of other things uh and
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
then that money would get returned to
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
right now gets returned to the state
 
02:12:30.189 --> 02:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
which um is another big reason for um
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
having a dedicated building Aid non-aps
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
fund because the goal would be to take
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
those monies and put them back in then
 
02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
you'd have more money to um rent to
 
02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:44.599 align:start position:0%
offer to those people on the list thank
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
you and I'm I'm happy to without V
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
visuals we have a whole flowchart and I
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
realize um for this new process spe
 
02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
specifically so I'm happy to have that
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
um conversation if you ever would like
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
it I know that you guys are really busy
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
but so a question for the committee just
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
stay where you are because there
 
02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
probably question coming back we we at
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
the last
 
02:13:11.470 --> 02:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
meeting I I heard folks saying that for
 
02:13:14.189 --> 02:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
a Charter Public School to receive money
 
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
they had to own the building is that
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
where we are as a
 
02:13:22.830 --> 02:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
committee for a charter school to get
 
02:13:24.430 --> 02:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
renovation or construction money in
 
02:13:26.149 --> 02:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
accordance with
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
1985 they had to own the building
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
because that's something right here that
 
02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
this puts in that was not in the
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
original bill I don't believe it
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
was it I I will say just in general um
 
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
just in general building a is only
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
eligible to um if you own the facility
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then if it's not um then you have
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
lease Aid so it's either one or the
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
other so if you're leasing building you
 
02:13:54.910 --> 02:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for lease Aid I'm not sure that
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to have lease
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
buildings be using State those State
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
dollars it's a separate appropriation if
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
you want to add anything just to add
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
that was in the original bill it looks
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
like you've preserved uh what would be
 
02:14:08.589 --> 02:14:08.599 align:start position:0%
on the first page of your Amendment line
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
21 exactly as I have it in my bill you
 
02:14:15.149 --> 02:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
have to own the building good good so
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a good hurdle there
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
and then within does then the charter
 
02:14:23.390 --> 02:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
school who receives this are they going
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
to be accountable to Roman 3 which is on
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
page one and goes on for repayment if
 
02:14:32.719 --> 02:14:34.430 align:start position:0%
page one and goes on for repayment if
they

02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:14:37.549 --> 02:14:37.559 align:start position:0%
desolve should they be held to the same
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
standard that the other public schools
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
are where they have to pay back a amount
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
which they have
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
received in this case they' be paying
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
back what they received less
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
depreciation I don't see why not I mean
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
we've have that um the draft has that in
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
there I think the original draft had
 
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
that in there it's we're just treating
 
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
the the significant difference is um
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
that the payment schedule everything
 
02:15:08.350 --> 02:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
else is the same um and then the only
 
02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
other things are when we're talking
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
about um District voters it's obviously
 
02:15:14.069 --> 02:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's different for Charter Schools as
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
well now the other change here of course
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
we tried to do it in conjunction with 45
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
to this this the change is here what was
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
passed in hb2 I can't recollect uh
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh that what what part of
 
02:15:32.589 --> 02:15:32.599 align:start position:0%
this is already
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
law um just to sort of retrace that uh
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
my house bill
 
02:15:42.549 --> 02:15:42.559 align:start position:0%
354 verbatim was in the house version of
 
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 the Senate took it all out
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure what the discussion
 
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
was I a feeling it was related to the
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill you referred to that was passed
 
02:15:54.990 --> 02:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
earlier this year uh but all of the um
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
original language of your Amendment
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
naturally is still law yeah but it looks
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
like you've done a great job of brushing
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
up the original House Bill five a 354
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
well I didn't do it the attorneys cross
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
street did it excellent job I would just
 
02:16:12.229 --> 02:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
add two if I could you know I've heard
 
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
so many opinions on school building Aid
 
02:16:17.310 --> 02:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
it's incredible everybody has a
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
different thought with regards to how
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
this should be done and I would just
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
simply say uh in the meantime let's just
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
include public charter schools in the
 
02:16:30.189 --> 02:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
application process until Perfection is
 
02:16:32.669 --> 02:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
reached on the perfect way to handle
 
02:16:34.870 --> 02:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
School building Aid in other words let's
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
not let Perfection be the enemy of the
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
good here and furthermore your Amendment
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
not only incorporates the house adopted
 
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
version of House Bill 354 that was in
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
our version of House Bill 2 but it still
 
02:16:51.950 --> 02:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
corrects the massive glaring discrepancy
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
in current law right now where one
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
section says Charter Schools do not get
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
school building Aid and another section
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
it says they get
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
30% that glaring conflict cannot stay
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
and your Amendment corrects that I would
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to adopt
 
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
it okay um further discussion from the
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent Cornell just as
 
02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
a question how many Charter Schools do
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
own their own buildings now
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
that's 11 now okay thank you can can we
 
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
tell can we get that updated then you
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
know I can't I can't count 11 you know I
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to discern what is
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
least what is not what's not going
 
02:17:38.429 --> 02:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
forward are these
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
11 that have been in business for at
 
02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
least one year and because I I we're
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
basing Aid on the
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
average daily membership right not
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
residents because the the the building
 
02:17:59.110 --> 02:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
Aid is for residents for a public school
 
02:18:00.429 --> 02:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
but these this is
 
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
adma um just to clarify that's only true
 
02:18:05.870 --> 02:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the C how you calculate their
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid rate Char schools don't do
 
02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
that they just qualify for 30% the only
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
time average daily membership comes in
 
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
in Residence comes in place is the
 
02:18:16.429 --> 02:18:16.439 align:start position:0%
calculation of the public school
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
districts building
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
rate yeah see there there was there was
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
an amendment put forth in division 2
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
last year which they used adma rather
 
02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:26.790 align:start position:0%
last year which they used adma rather
than

02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
admr but that was for that other program
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that's that's haunting us and
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to come back so but so this
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
is based just
 
02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
upon uh what because median so your
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid rate is based on median
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
family income in equalized valuation per
 
02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
pupil that per pupil is where the admr
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
comes from um so that's why it's
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
important but that's only important when
 
02:18:55.669 --> 02:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
you are calculating a building Aid rate
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
for Charter Schools you can't calculate
 
02:19:01.389 --> 02:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
that so that's 30% at least that's 30%
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
of attendant or it's based on 30% of the
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
eligible project costs so it's just that
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
um you you have a project and you we
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
determine what is eligible um expenses
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
that U meet the uh regulations and the
 
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
project qualifies for 30% all the way up
 
02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
to 60% school districts we calculate
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
that rate 30 to 60% for Charter Schools
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
we don't calculate that rate we just say
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
30% and it's 30% of the eligible project
 
02:19:33.309 --> 02:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
costs or 40% of the eligible project
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
cost all the way up to 60% of the
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
eligible project costs do you do when
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the criteria for any
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
school for approval there are certain
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
minimum standards which you have in
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
rules square footage Etc mhm correct
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
does that is that applicable to the
 
02:19:53.760 --> 02:19:55.150 align:start position:0%
does that is that applicable to the
charter

02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
charter
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
school it is I can't think of any um any
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't are all life health safety
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
related issues they're all things that
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
charer schools are having to meet anyway
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh we require our building to be ADA
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
Compliant public charter schools have to
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
be so then is that local that criteria
 
02:20:13.429 --> 02:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
then that engineering criteria that you
 
02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
use at all related to num students in a
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
classroom or the number of students the
 
02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
school has correct it's all related to
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment or enrollment
 
02:20:27.870 --> 02:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
projections okay so we're we're nearing
 
02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
that point where AID may be based upon
 
02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
attendance and do we have to before you
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
get renovation or construction do you
 
02:20:38.190 --> 02:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
have to be in business for at least one
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
year uh we don't have that requirement
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you have to be a business one year
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't see that in the amendment uh
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
so but your formula for public school is
 
02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
you take the
 
02:20:51.870 --> 02:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
5year average to determine the building
 
02:20:56.429 --> 02:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for either t or
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
Amy yes representative Ford thank you Mr
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to quit at 12:30 on this one
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
and take lunch I'm kind of hung up in
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
those kind of situations in which maybe
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of ownership literally or
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
whether there something like a charter
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
School wants to lease a building from
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
the school system which it does not need
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
at present but the school system doesn't
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
want to give up ownership of the
 
02:21:29.389 --> 02:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
building in case the charter school
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't continue and wants it back how
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
then do we wind up with something in
 
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
this kind of a process
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
whereby you basically are renovating a
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
school in order to lease it to a charter
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
school which the community wants
 
02:21:48.030 --> 02:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's in agreement with a goal MH
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
then how you use this mechanism to
 
02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
achieve the renovation of the building
 
02:21:55.030 --> 02:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
which should the charter school fail
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
will by contract revert to the
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
school that's a very good question um
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
probably something we should think a
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more about but um the uh but
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
it's the public school district that
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
would have to apply for that building
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
Aid because they are the owners of The
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
Bu The District because they're on paper
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
is the is the owner correct correct now
 
02:22:18.670 --> 02:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
what's interesting though that question
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
is that does the charter school become
 
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
eligible for lease Aid because they're
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
leasing from the public school district
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
that received building Aid so it's a
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
very valid question maybe that is
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
something we'll have to take a look at
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
like are is the state paying lease Aid
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
on a space that was paid for by building
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
Aid is that is that kind of uh double
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
dipping I don't know that's a very good
 
02:22:41.910 --> 02:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
question though but I do know in order
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
to get building a to renovate that
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
building it would have to be the public
 
02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
school district that files that
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
application that's seems like a local
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
issue between the local school board and
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
the charter school that's leasing uh we
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
have here in the last page that the
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
state we were concerned about the state
 
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
not being liable for any of these other
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
assets which the charter school may have
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
encumbered during the time that they've
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
been in business and this specifically
 
02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
says no the state won't be held liable
 
02:23:13.950 --> 02:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
now the local school district who made
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
that lease they'd have to have that in
 
02:23:18.190 --> 02:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
their lease agreement wouldn't they so
 
02:23:19.710 --> 02:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's not really something when we're
 
02:23:21.150 --> 02:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
talking about school building Aid which
 
02:23:23.950 --> 02:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
we should be concerned about
 
02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
here I'm not sure I'd have to think a
 
02:23:27.469 --> 02:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
little bit I'd have to think that
 
02:23:28.990 --> 02:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
through a little bit more we've never
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
had we've well first of all we've been
 
02:23:32.590 --> 02:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
on a moratorium for 10 years so we've
 
02:23:34.790 --> 02:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
all have only a handful of cases that
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
we've funded four school projects um and
 
02:23:38.429 --> 02:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
that hasn't come up yet and it's a very
 
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
good question for us to think a little
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
bit more about the only area I know is
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
like winnisquam where they have that
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
empty building that's now charter
 
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:48.030 align:start position:0%
empty building that's now charter
compass

02:23:48.030 --> 02:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
compass
 
02:23:51.309 --> 02:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
that used to be a public school so in
 
02:23:53.230 --> 02:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
that example that's maybe a good example
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
to talk about so that was Union sandborn
 
02:23:56.590 --> 02:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's the school that
 
02:23:58.030 --> 02:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about so Union sorn
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
applied for building Aid um had they
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
received it their voter they were
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
actually I think vote ranked one on the
 
02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
list if I recall um their voters did not
 
02:24:10.510 --> 02:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
approve that project so we never um gave
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
state aid for it um but had we given
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
state aid for it and then later that
 
02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
school Consolidated with the other
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
school that they they those kids now go
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
to um and sold the building to the
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
charger school or even even if they
 
02:24:29.510 --> 02:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
didn't that would be a penalty for
 
02:24:30.990 --> 02:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
repayment and we would have asked for
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
all of those funds back W Gan would have
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
had to pay that back correct they would
 
02:24:34.120 --> 02:24:36.630 align:start position:0%
had to pay that back correct they would
have

02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions for doe yes
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
represent Damon thank
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
you could you just comment in regards to
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass would the criteria
 
02:24:51.469 --> 02:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
for Charter Schools applying for
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid be the same criteria as
 
02:24:56.910 --> 02:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
public schools currently have and then I
 
02:24:59.269 --> 02:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
have a followup oh absolutely there's
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
really no difference um the only
 
02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
difference um in my um head that's going
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
to be um somewhat significantly
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
different is this payment the way we pay
 
02:25:13.950 --> 02:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
them and what is that is going to do is
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
continue to create a tail it will be a
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
baby tail but it will be a tail um and
 
02:25:21.030 --> 02:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:22.630 align:start position:0%
so that
may

02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:25:26.550 --> 02:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
make Charter Schools more likely to
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
receive building Aid even though it
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like a penalty because you're
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
paying for interest but because when we
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
we get building Aid in um we get an
 
02:25:39.389 --> 02:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
appropriation every year so if that
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation happens to be I'm sorry I
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
always have to use numbers but if that
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
happens to be $30 million that we get
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
appropriated that year and we have a $29
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
million of projects that we offer too
 
02:25:55.630 --> 02:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
there might be a sliver left that is not
 
02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
attractive to anybody else but might be
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
very attractive to a a public charger
 
02:26:04.349 --> 02:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
school um we might only have $400,000
 
02:26:06.429 --> 02:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
left most people are going to bck at
 
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
that because they're they're looking for
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
full 80% and they may pass and stay on
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
the list because they're going to wait
 
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
another year and hopefully get offered a
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
full award and it might tell the charter
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
and that little
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
amount will trickle down um and it's
 
02:26:22.389 --> 02:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
actually really beneficial not just to
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools but also um to smaller
 
02:26:27.349 --> 02:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
projects we're now seeing we were a
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
little worried about smaller projects
 
02:26:31.389 --> 02:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
not being funded with this system but
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
now it's kind of nice to see because
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
that little that little chunk that
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
schools are passing up on will mean
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
something to the smaller projects on the
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
bottom I don't know if that fully
 
02:26:42.990 --> 02:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
answers your question but for me that
 
02:26:46.190 --> 02:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's the only uh pretty big difference
 
02:26:48.429 --> 02:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
but that Charter Schools will play in
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
this um in our process and it's because
 
02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
of that payment
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
schedule the way this been written is
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
that they're accountable for everything
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
that a riger public school is
 
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
accountable for and we meshed it in with
 
02:27:03.269 --> 02:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
our current
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
law um it's the payment and all that
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's different and then the other
 
02:27:09.790 --> 02:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
difference is the voter you know the
 
02:27:11.110 --> 02:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools aren't waiting for
 
02:27:13.990 --> 02:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
voters to pass their project so um that
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
will be a you know when I said you hang
 
02:27:18.429 --> 02:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
on to that award for three up to three
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
voting Cycles you know my expectation is
 
02:27:22.830 --> 02:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
that charter school will be able to
 
02:27:24.830 --> 02:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
start construction that very next year
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that they'll have support
 
02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:32.550 align:start position:0%
 
Trustees

02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
Trustees
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes so I appreciate what you just
 
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
explained and I think I understand it
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
um is it correct though practically
 
02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
speaking since we have no history of
 
02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
appropriating anywhere near the amount
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
of money that is requested for building
 
02:27:52.910 --> 02:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
projects that essentially this
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
legislation would create a yet more
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
competitive environment for building Aid
 
02:28:02.190 --> 02:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
in that Charter Schools applying for Aid
 
02:28:03.870 --> 02:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
would be competing with the public
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
school projects that we already fund
 
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
only a token portion
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
of uh what did you say 11 11 schools I
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
suppose of all those 11 school yeah it
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
creates more there's more people that'll
 
02:28:18.429 --> 02:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
Ed eligible so certainly one charter
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
school added to the list is going to be
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
one more school that's in front of some
 
02:28:26.469 --> 02:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
other school um it just when you think
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
of percentages wise it's probably not
 
02:28:31.150 --> 02:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
really that significant that not all 11
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
schools are going to come forward at
 
02:28:36.190 --> 02:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
once um it's also when we talk about
 
02:28:38.349 --> 02:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
that pot of money if we're only paying
 
02:28:41.190 --> 02:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
them um that that we're putting them on
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
that tail appropriation they're also
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
taking less of that larger appropriation
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
so um um so but yes that's a fair fair
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
any competition they're all competing
 
02:28:53.790 --> 02:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
other and the amount of money available
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
for uh building Aid is going to grow
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
because our tail is going down signif
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
and kind of rapidly here in another four
 
02:29:06.750 --> 02:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
four years it drops sign other than
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
those couple payments are going to
 
02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
string it out what 2 41
 
02:29:15.750 --> 02:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
correct okay it's 12:30 and we need to
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
we need to take a break here at least
 
02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
discuss where we're going is there any
 
02:29:22.190 --> 02:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
more that anybody wants from the
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
Department right now or representa
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you very much thank you
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
yeah or T and T if you could get back
 
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
those 11 schools that you have course we
 
02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:34.389 align:start position:0%
those 11 schools that you have course we
appreciate

02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
that would it also be of any value to
 
02:29:39.910 --> 02:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
figure out with the 11 schools the the
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
values on their building or if they're
 
02:29:43.630 --> 02:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
looking at potentially applying for
 
02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
building Aid in the near future oh yes
 
02:29:47.309 --> 02:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
yes defin defitely the values the
 
02:29:48.950 --> 02:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
schools whether they're intending to do
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
it I also like to have their enrollment
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
numbers okay sounds good yeah great
 
02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:55.349 align:start position:0%
numbers okay sounds good yeah great
thank

02:29:55.349 --> 02:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:29:58.990 --> 02:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
you so committee do you want to come
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
back in another half hour and trying to
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
get to another couple bills okay good
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
because we we need to I know that we
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
have one member has to get out of here
 
02:30:11.550 --> 02:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
to go back to work for she loves to be
 
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
working she gets paid in that J she gets
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
paid she has paid for half and that's
 
02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
the different parking tck okay thank you
 
02:30:21.269 --> 02:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
very much so let's come back at 1:00 and
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:45.439 --> 03:22:20.429 align:start position:0%
 
up

03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:40.750 --> 03:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
cleanup

03:22:59.030 --> 03:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:00.469 --> 03:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
I don't have an answer on this thing
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
right here now maybe what we ought to do
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
is hold off on this one and find out
 
03:23:07.710 --> 03:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
from cordelli what that all was about
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
was this something put forth
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:21.389 --> 03:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
know I I D is good it's yeah that's got
 
03:23:24.070 --> 03:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
to that's got to be changed to
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive but the last part where
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:34.670 --> 03:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
know oh it's been changed
 
03:23:34.680 --> 03:23:40.670 align:start position:0%
know oh it's been changed
[Music]

03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:47.389 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:23:47.389 --> 03:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:47.399 --> 03:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
 
193

03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
is I think if there's a a simple reason
 
03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
why that's deleted and the doe or or
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
Glenn has a good answer then we can move
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
forward on it but I don't think we can
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
do anything right now so we ought to
 
03:24:11.389 --> 03:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
jump over this postpone it to when we
 
03:24:11.399 --> 03:24:12.189 align:start position:0%
jump over this postpone it to when we
meet

03:24:12.189 --> 03:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:24:15.309 --> 03:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to another
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
bill let's go on to uh 627 or or
 
03:24:22.479 --> 03:24:25.469 align:start position:0%
bill let's go on to uh 627 or or
155

03:24:25.469 --> 03:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
155
 
03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
um HB 155 I thought we had another bill
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's the shity
 
03:24:30.120 --> 03:24:32.030 align:start position:0%
that's the shity
bond

03:24:32.030 --> 03:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
bond
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:07.269 --> 03:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.750 --> 03:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
more you know off hand I can tell you
 
03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
why I have a hard time with this bill
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
right now because we're we're messing
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
around with the governance of higher
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
education and the higher education
 
03:25:24.750 --> 03:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
commission which is that commission
 
03:25:27.750 --> 03:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
which approves new institutions coming
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
in and it's diling from that one member
 
03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
to be appointed by the governor and
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
Council as a representative from a
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit college University not a
 
03:25:39.389 --> 03:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire College
 
03:25:41.790 --> 03:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
University Council that's eliminating
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
Darth that's eliminating um
 
03:25:50.309 --> 03:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh numerous colleges in our our
 
03:25:53.550 --> 03:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
state it's increasing from two to eight
 
03:25:56.950 --> 03:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
the number of uh people from
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
postsecondary care
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
schools no what it's not going to eight
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
that's number eight they cross out the
 
03:26:04.479 --> 03:26:05.710 align:start position:0%
that's number eight they cross out the
eight

03:26:05.710 --> 03:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
eight
 
03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:10.389 align:start position:0%
eight
above

03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.399 --> 03:26:33.630 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:26:33.630 --> 03:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
how many yeah let's take a straw boat on
 
03:26:38.309 --> 03:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
this uh how many people just say we need
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
to it all the
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:47.910 align:start position:0%
to it all the
bill

03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
well there's other things they want to
 
03:26:51.150 --> 03:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
change this
 
03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
criteria the commission
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
shall regulate this and establish that
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's already all a lot of that's
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
already in law apply for accept and
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
expend state federal and other grants or
 
03:27:06.910 --> 03:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
eliminating that
 
03:27:06.920 --> 03:27:10.309 align:start position:0%
eliminating that
part

03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:10.319 --> 03:27:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:27:13.990 --> 03:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:20.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:27:20.229 --> 03:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:22.269 --> 03:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
mhm I can tell you right now the
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
governance of all higher education under
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
the gun right now we're looking at that
 
03:27:28.830 --> 03:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
trying to rewrite the whole thing and
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
that would include the higher education
 
03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
commission which is made up of your
 
03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:34.750 align:start position:0%
commission which is made up of your
college

03:27:34.750 --> 03:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
college
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
presidents and other people are coming
 
03:27:42.150 --> 03:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
out of high it um I I don't think we
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
should be messing with that at this
 
03:27:48.429 --> 03:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
time it's almost like a shotgun type
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
deal by doing it that way so I I feel
 
03:28:09.870 --> 03:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:11.950 --> 03:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
this right now we're looking at
 
03:28:13.710 --> 03:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
governance I mean the chancellors we
 
03:28:15.910 --> 03:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
have an interim Chancellor that's also
 
03:28:17.950 --> 03:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
Chancellor of the University system is
 
03:28:22.189 --> 03:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
also at the same time president of
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
unh so does that mean according to this
 
03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
that the president of
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
unh um who with the others two
 
03:28:33.910 --> 03:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
presidents for from
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
institutions see the president of the
 
03:28:40.030 --> 03:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire on Roman
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
281 the the chancellor under three does
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
votes it needs a lot more work than this
 
03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill does and we shouldn't be touching
 
03:28:57.269 --> 03:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
out from what the trustees are doing
 
03:29:02.550 --> 03:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
right now and the governor's doing and
 
03:29:05.429 --> 03:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that's been put in to try
 
03:29:07.150 --> 03:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
to push something to happen and I got
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
that in we'll probably pull that once we
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
get the emergency order put through so I
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
would say at this time this bill is
 
03:29:19.510 --> 03:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
delving into something that the timing
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:36.550 --> 03:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
right completely
 
03:29:39.990 --> 03:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
different considerations and what sherad
 
03:29:43.189 --> 03:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
just referred to first half B make sense
 
03:29:47.550 --> 03:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
to me to prer acting on but on page
 
03:29:50.830 --> 03:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
original that's forward that's a
 
03:29:54.239 --> 03:29:57.150 align:start position:0%
original that's forward that's a
different

03:29:57.150 --> 03:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
consideration I thought that the concern
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
was that ifar school
 
03:30:05.110 --> 03:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
closed the students enrolled would be
 
03:30:06.670 --> 03:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
out their
 
03:30:09.189 --> 03:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
investment and not
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
protected and that this was an attempt
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
to somewhat address
 
03:30:28.389 --> 03:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.399 --> 03:30:30.070 align:start position:0%
 
amount

03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
right so it's less
 
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
prot 10% of what the annual gross
 
03:30:40.229 --> 03:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
tuition for current Academic Year versus
 
03:30:54.670 --> 03:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:59.389 --> 03:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
student it's kind of standardizing it at
 
03:30:59.399 --> 03:31:01.189 align:start position:0%
student it's kind of standardizing it at
10%

03:31:01.189 --> 03:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
10%
 
03:31:03.469 --> 03:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
um rather
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
place

03:31:34.590 --> 03:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
your call has been forwarded to an
 
03:31:38.349 --> 03:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
automated I just trying to get a hold of
 
03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
Steve applebe because he could give us
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
an answer
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:48.910 --> 03:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
ask the latter part of the
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
bill Steve's GNA call me right
 
03:31:56.349 --> 03:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
back now what they gave us there was a
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
letter that went with
 
03:32:02.309 --> 03:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
it it said on p on page three line 3 to7
 
03:32:04.990 --> 03:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see language changes on the bond
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
amount requirements the thinking being
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
that the current Bond requirement is
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
potentially daunting and over wng which
 
03:32:14.429 --> 03:32:14.439 align:start position:0%
potentially could be unnecessarily fatal
 
03:32:16.750 --> 03:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
to an institution obligated to secure a
 
03:32:19.349 --> 03:32:19.359 align:start position:0%
bond sufficient to reimburse the tuition
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
for any service contract which could
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
also be read as every service contract
 
03:32:27.469 --> 03:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
the new proposed language is more
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
realistic and more manageable Steve or
 
03:32:30.279 --> 03:32:32.830 align:start position:0%
realistic and more manageable Steve or
Steve

03:32:32.830 --> 03:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:36.429 --> 03:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
app Steve can you hear me yes sir how
 
03:32:38.670 --> 03:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
are you good Steve we're looking at
 
03:32:41.229 --> 03:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
you're on speaker here in in uh in with
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
just some people here on the committee
 
03:32:45.870 --> 03:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
and myself uh we're looking at
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
hp55 that's a bill that's relative to
 
03:32:50.670 --> 03:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
the division of educator support and
 
03:32:52.830 --> 03:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
higher education and relative to shity
 
03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
and deification for private
 
03:32:55.870 --> 03:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
post-secondary career
 
03:32:59.790 --> 03:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
schools you wrote in a email to us in
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
response to myself and Dave
 
03:33:06.070 --> 03:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
luno uh I am emailing to the to follow
 
03:33:08.229 --> 03:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
up on Dave's request for information
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the higher education past
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
history regarding applying for ETC
 
03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
grants on page two line 8 of the bill we
 
03:33:19.630 --> 03:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
have checked back to 2016 found no
 
03:33:21.790 --> 03:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
instances of commission conducting any
 
03:33:24.349 --> 03:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
of these activities to go further we'll
 
03:33:27.030 --> 03:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
take a number of hours off staff time of
 
03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:27.950 align:start position:0%
take a number of hours off staff time of
Staff

03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
Staff
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
time I would make one other suggestion
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
line 8 could be unstruck but page two
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
line e the commission shall could be
 
03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
amended to read the commission may I
 
03:33:42.349 --> 03:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
hope this information is helpful please
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
let me know how I can assist further
 
03:33:46.750 --> 03:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
we're calling for
 
03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:48.309 align:start position:0%
we're calling for
assistance

03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
03:33:52.830 --> 03:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
forward I think so
 
03:33:58.630 --> 03:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
um you know the I know that there were
 
03:34:00.910 --> 03:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
concerns around the shy shy and
 
03:34:03.630 --> 03:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
dentification Portion for licensed
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
career schools and certainly that could
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
be struck um and brought back at another
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
time but I think that the makeup of the
 
03:34:13.950 --> 03:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
higher ed commission should be adjusted
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been changed in many many
 
03:34:20.229 --> 03:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
years and uh for example uh we no longer
 
03:34:23.269 --> 03:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
have any for-profit private colleges in
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
our state yet there is an open seat uh
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
that has been now for seven years on the
 
03:34:32.110 --> 03:34:32.120 align:start position:0%
commission because it's the own statute
 
03:34:36.429 --> 03:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that that portion should
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
move forward if possible and I
 
03:34:40.710 --> 03:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
completely understand concerns around
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
the career School portion um and if
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's that is I think uh less important
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
than adjusting the uh the commission
 
03:34:52.870 --> 03:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
membership so what's the definition of a
 
03:34:55.110 --> 03:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
for for-profit college or university
 
03:34:58.150 --> 03:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's then it's not something like uh
 
03:35:00.269 --> 03:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth or some of our other privates
 
03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
in the state no so we only currently
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
have nonprofit colleges in our state the
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
last for-profit college that existed was
 
03:35:16.590 --> 03:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay you have question are there any
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
other questions possibly for
 
03:35:26.110 --> 03:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
Steve theity part was what we were
 
03:35:28.349 --> 03:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
interested in what where the commission
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
says the commission
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
shall um and there's they're leaving off
 
03:35:36.389 --> 03:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
one item out of that and you suggested
 
03:35:38.910 --> 03:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
putting it to May item number four where
 
03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
it says the commission shall apply for
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
accept and expend state federal or other
 
03:35:49.630 --> 03:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
grants um why would that be scratched
 
03:35:53.790 --> 03:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
out in this bill so our concern would be
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
legal's concern when I when I talked to
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
our attorney about it was it says shall
 
03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
apply for Grants which grants are we
 
03:36:04.590 --> 03:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
talking about there are hundreds of
 
03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
higher red
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
grants potentially that we would be
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
forced to apply for that we never
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
applied for in the past we don't have
 
03:36:15.309 --> 03:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
the staff to to complete those
 
03:36:17.950 --> 03:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
applications um so so is not to preclude
 
03:36:20.429 --> 03:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
us from possibly applying to one I that
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
was my suggestion May
 
03:36:26.910 --> 03:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
saying it reads like we need to go out
 
03:36:28.590 --> 03:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
and apply for every higher grant that
 
03:36:28.600 --> 03:36:29.590 align:start position:0%
and apply for every higher grant that
comes

03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
comes
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
along okay but do does the commission
 
03:36:35.790 --> 03:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
apply for these grants or is it the
 
03:36:37.790 --> 03:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
individual institution applies for
 
03:36:41.189 --> 03:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
Grants institutions apply for Grants I I
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
was on the commission for 10 years
 
03:36:45.389 --> 03:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
before coming to the department so from
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
my recollection and again we would have
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
to go to the archives to research this
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's why I only went back to 2016 but
 
03:36:53.309 --> 03:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
my recollection I joined the Commission
 
03:36:56.750 --> 03:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
in 2007 and I do not recall the the
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
commission ever applying for a grant
 
03:36:58.680 --> 03:37:02.110 align:start position:0%
commission ever applying for a grant
from

03:37:02.110 --> 03:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.469 --> 03:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
2007 okay are there any other questions
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:12.910 --> 03:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
this yeah in New Hampshire and there's
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
they're all career schools okay uh
 
03:37:17.990 --> 03:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner says that in looking up
 
03:37:21.790 --> 03:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
for profit uh schools is it colleges or
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
University or schools it just says
 
03:37:25.150 --> 03:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
Schools they're they're the career
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
schools okay they're talking about these
 
03:37:30.389 --> 03:37:30.399 align:start position:0%
for-profit schools as being career
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
schools yes there are already uh seats
 
03:37:35.229 --> 03:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
on the commission for licensed career
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
schools that is a separate category
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay so if you look at the
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
membership of the
 
03:37:48.030 --> 03:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
commission right we say um nonprofit
 
03:37:51.550 --> 03:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
College private for-profit college
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
career school you know they're different
 
03:37:56.710 --> 03:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
categories of of
 
03:37:58.870 --> 03:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
members and those those the career
 
03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
schools could be nonprofit or for-profit
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
we don't make that distinction Curr need
 
03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:04.910 align:start position:0%
we don't make that distinction Curr need
statute

03:38:04.910 --> 03:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh okay where it says that the
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
membership on this Commission
 
03:38:13.950 --> 03:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
includes the the president of the
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire the
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
chancellor of the University system of
 
03:38:19.550 --> 03:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what are we doing when
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's one
 
03:38:25.150 --> 03:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
person uh currently um the currently
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
cath Venture is filling the roll the
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
chancellor position interim Chancellor
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
interim Chancellor right so um but again
 
03:38:34.990 --> 03:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's where I think that in the
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation we had a
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
design language for some of these and
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
that would help us in this situation we
 
03:38:44.229 --> 03:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
did it for the the bill does it for the
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
community college but not for the
 
03:38:45.680 --> 03:38:47.110 align:start position:0%
community college but not for the
University

03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
University
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
system or do it
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
should okay I think for both of the
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
chancellor positions we also wanted to
 
03:39:00.910 --> 03:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
add or designate okay just in case we
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
get into this situation
 
03:39:06.990 --> 03:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
again okay so in looking at this bill if
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
we made those changes there that we you
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
just spoke
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
of and went along with eliminating
 
03:39:17.950 --> 03:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit College University and change
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.429 --> 03:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
may if we passed that part of the bill
 
03:39:29.429 --> 03:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
and scratched everything doing with aury
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
demn ification is that along with what
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to
 
03:39:38.670 --> 03:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
okay any further comments from the
 
03:39:42.830 --> 03:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
03:39:46.030 --> 03:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
that I think we we look like we're good
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%

03:40:34.189 --> 03:40:34.199 align:start position:0%
different Bill EXC me I got so on this
 
03:40:34.199 --> 03:40:36.469 align:start position:0%
different Bill EXC me I got so on this
bill

03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:40:40.110 --> 03:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
155 making the change where it says the
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%

design that way Kathy prenter who used
 
03:40:47.550 --> 03:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
to be the state treasurer who's now the
 
03:40:50.110 --> 03:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
interim chancelor could be that
 
03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:51.910 align:start position:0%
interim chancelor could be that
person

03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
um and then eliminating line 15 16 as it
 
03:40:57.880 --> 03:40:59.870 align:start position:0%
um and then eliminating line 15 16 as it
struck

03:40:59.870 --> 03:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
struck
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
out and then at the top of page two the
 
03:41:06.670 --> 03:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
commission sha May sh to
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
May taking that strike out for number
 
03:41:13.510 --> 03:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
four and then ending that online
 
03:41:15.870 --> 03:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
everything from 29 onwards except for
 
03:41:17.309 --> 03:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
the effective date which would you have
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
to change well would would be the
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
that everything at the bottom of page
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
two and all of Page Three except for the
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
effective date do we want to change at e
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
the sh to May or do we want to leave sha
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
for those other things and do May for
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
one I me are there because it seemed
 
03:41:55.229 --> 03:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
like he would yeah it seemed like he was
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
just saying May for the for line four
 
03:42:01.149 --> 03:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but sh he didn't but not for
 
03:42:01.159 --> 03:42:04.349 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah but sh he didn't but not for
the

03:42:04.349 --> 03:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
rest how about if I give this to Steve
 
03:42:08.910 --> 03:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
and have Steve clean it up and I'll
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
mention that fact
 
03:42:12.550 --> 03:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then when we do the other ones we'll
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
have something in front of us just go
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
right through it good y okay let's move
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
on to the next
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.960 --> 03:43:10.590 align:start position:0%
 
627

03:43:10.590 --> 03:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
Lea this looks like another sb266
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill it's the one where they're
 
03:43:24.349 --> 03:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
modifying 193 c e h and k this one
 
03:43:24.359 --> 03:43:29.030 align:start position:0%
modifying 193 c e h and k this one
modifies

03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
H well I didn't choose what part should
 
03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:32.710 align:start position:0%
H well I didn't choose what part should
be

03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
modified um this may not be the best
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
place to put this that was one of the
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
things we were going to determine
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
is where it should go I didn't pick the
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
where I was just trying
 
03:43:51.309 --> 03:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
to we talked about there should be
 
03:43:52.670 --> 03:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
accountability there should be
 
03:43:54.269 --> 03:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
accountability there was no
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
accountability there was all kinds of
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
arguments as to what the accountability
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
should be and where in the bill that was
 
03:44:05.229 --> 03:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
put forward by I believe representative
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
luno but I'm not sure there was
 
03:44:11.469 --> 03:44:11.479 align:start position:0%
accountability in that and he was very
 
03:44:13.229 --> 03:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
proud of that and I thought well what if
 
03:44:15.870 --> 03:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
I just take that accountability that he
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
put in his
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
bill um and see how that flies and so I
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
took this almost word for word straight
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
out of that bill that was submitted year
 
03:44:27.439 --> 03:44:30.189 align:start position:0%
out of that bill that was submitted year
before

03:44:30.189 --> 03:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
last and that was that was the point
 
03:44:39.149 --> 03:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
um but as I said it ol picked where it
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
went I'm not not sure that that's where
 
03:44:44.149 --> 03:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:47.389 --> 03:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
go and so the question is are people
 
03:44:50.590 --> 03:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:00.349 --> 03:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
not we we've been just working on you
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
know remember Nate came in and Caitlyn
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with this 193
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
H and we looked at remember the
 
03:45:13.149 --> 03:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and what would have
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
happened to those schools drop the
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
support they get from the federal
 
03:45:17.600 --> 03:45:19.950 align:start position:0%
support they get from the federal
plan

03:45:19.950 --> 03:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:45:22.750 --> 03:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
um and we went with that shorter version
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
because we just didn't have the time to
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
do 266 everything in it I think we're at
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
the same point on this well that's what
 
03:45:31.990 --> 03:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering I mean and this may
 
03:45:33.910 --> 03:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with h that's just
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
where they put it it it might best be
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
put some place else um
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
but as I said this was straight word for
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
and actually there was a note that
 
03:45:57.149 --> 03:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
instead of being after
 
03:46:00.269 --> 03:46:00.279 align:start position:0%
H4 it should go after that somewhere
 
03:46:01.550 --> 03:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
03:46:01.560 --> 03:46:04.710 align:start position:0%
rather than
replacing

03:46:04.710 --> 03:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
H4 perhaps in
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
six I don't know but yeah it'll take
 
03:46:11.910 --> 03:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
some work so are people wanting to do it
 
03:46:14.349 --> 03:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
or not is their interest in even passing
 
03:46:16.510 --> 03:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
it or
 
03:46:19.349 --> 03:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
not I put it in because we were trying
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with accountability and I
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
figured if that was already in a bill
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
that half of the committee supported you
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.830 --> 03:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.670 --> 03:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
them well there's one coming up that's a
 
03:46:57.309 --> 03:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
193e but I don't think we should be
 
03:46:59.670 --> 03:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
messing around with inadequate education
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
either at this point in time I think
 
03:47:04.990 --> 03:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not going to gain us a
 
03:47:08.670 --> 03:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
thing um because we've just recently
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
addressed that by modifying some of the
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
required subject areas like personal
 
03:47:16.389 --> 03:47:16.399 align:start position:0%
finance literacy on H where you talked
 
03:47:21.269 --> 03:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:23.389 --> 03:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
assessment I I would think that the
 
03:47:25.870 --> 03:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee may want
 
03:47:29.469 --> 03:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
to deal with that uh because that's that
 
03:47:34.830 --> 03:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
that committee's task with 193c and
 
03:47:38.790 --> 03:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
H and we that's for oversight of how we
 
03:47:40.269 --> 03:47:40.279 align:start position:0%
have accountabil
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
ability and they have statutory
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and that's another
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
03:47:53.070 --> 03:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.309 --> 03:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
it I think you can see right on if you
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
have your Green books on page
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
571 it says in addition to the
 
03:48:02.910 --> 03:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of paragraph one schools
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
shall meet performance-based indicators
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
under this chapter and Statewide
 
03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
performance targets new Mission targets
 
03:48:13.710 --> 03:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
as approved by the Legislative oversight
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee and so probably the
 
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee you know
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
we could you
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
know could inter room study it or or
 
03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
just you know make a recommendation that
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
that other committee look into this and
 
03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:32.279 align:start position:0%
come up with some recommendation we're
 
03:48:33.910 --> 03:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing right now with the
 
03:48:33.920 --> 03:48:35.870 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing right now with the
266

03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
266
 
03:48:38.790 --> 03:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
stuff which is this is one of the
 
03:48:41.710 --> 03:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
chapters which that bill was trying to
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
address and the compromise with doe was
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
we'll put your two pages in there but
 
03:48:48.870 --> 03:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do the 24 pages of
 
03:48:48.880 --> 03:48:50.830 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do the 24 pages of
two

03:48:50.830 --> 03:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:48:53.550 --> 03:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
266 so maybe we gotta be working a
 
03:48:55.790 --> 03:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
little bit with Nate on some of this as
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
well and with Caitlyn and with the
 
03:48:57.960 --> 03:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
well and with Caitlyn and with the
oversight

03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
oversight
committee

03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah uh this
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
chapter uh deals with school Improvement
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh with targeted support yeah um um and
 
03:49:14.309 --> 03:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
it seems like this is from ESS or a um
 
03:49:16.429 --> 03:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
that it that it was designed to work
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
with targeted schools whereas the bill
 
03:49:24.149 --> 03:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at is like um
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.229 --> 03:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
oversight so I don't think you can I
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't know as you can change a lot of
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.319 --> 03:49:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
Essa

03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
Essa
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
well we talked about that we couldn't
 
03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
change some things like the percentage
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
numbers because of the funding yeah um I
 
03:49:50.429 --> 03:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
really do believe that this is should go
 
03:49:53.429 --> 03:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
to legislative oversight which is got
 
03:49:58.429 --> 03:49:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:01.630 --> 03:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
act I I you know for us to do something
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
right now and doing this after we've
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
already said on 266 we're not going to
 
03:50:10.189 --> 03:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
go with it now to go with it and format
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
I think it might be contrary to what we
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
said although it's a good thing it needs
 
03:50:18.830 --> 03:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
to be done we need to get on top of a
 
03:50:21.630 --> 03:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
accountability you know a a 56%
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
graduation rate even if you add the I
 
03:50:28.990 --> 03:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
adequate so how do you
 
03:50:33.990 --> 03:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
assess it's not necessarily through a
 
03:50:35.469 --> 03:50:35.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment either there's
 
03:50:37.030 --> 03:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
other ways of doing
 
03:50:39.710 --> 03:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
that but we have law has to be an
 
03:50:39.720 --> 03:50:45.870 align:start position:0%
that but we have law has to be an
objective

03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
assessment I I think
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
basically if we itl it we make a
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the purpose the
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill be directed directly
 
03:51:00.269 --> 03:51:00.279 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee to delve into
 
03:51:02.550 --> 03:51:02.560 align:start position:0%
this subject area and that something we
 
03:51:05.070 --> 03:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
can do yeah oh yes send it to them well
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
you can start that right off I'm fine
 
03:51:11.229 --> 03:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
is everybody pretty agreeable to
 
03:51:16.990 --> 03:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
that okay let's let's do that I don't
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
see anybody objecting to
 
03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
it so that takes us through everything
 
03:51:22.750 --> 03:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
we did
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
today when's a good date that's good for
 
03:51:27.309 --> 03:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
people to get together it's getting hot
 
03:51:30.510 --> 03:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
room what well we have to you know make
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
some you know we have some amendments we
 
03:51:38.590 --> 03:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
want to put together we got to make a
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the supposedly the
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
full committee this is a committee the
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
whole to the full committee so we should
 
03:51:49.229 --> 03:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
come forth with a recommendation so all
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
these things which we've been addressing
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
we got to do that the next committee the
 
03:51:56.750 --> 03:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
whole we could make some of those
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the the committee
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
that we meet in November probably the
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
second week there of November yes
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.920 --> 03:52:33.870 align:start position:0%
 
ofation

03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
Cary of The Mountain View Culinary
 
03:52:38.429 --> 03:52:38.439 align:start position:0%
Academy we are also aware of the
 
03:52:38.439 --> 03:52:39.750 align:start position:0%
Academy we are also aware of the
importance

03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
importance
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the tourism industry in our County
 
03:52:43.189 --> 03:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
and the serious need for qualified
 
03:52:45.469 --> 03:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant staff it is our understanding
 
03:52:46.750 --> 03:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
they have been working with you and
 
03:52:48.750 --> 03:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
other department of education staff to
 
03:52:51.469 --> 03:52:51.479 align:start position:0%
secure their necessary license to open
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
but that an adequate charity bond is the
 
03:52:56.309 --> 03:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
sticking point the problem seems to be
 
03:52:59.550 --> 03:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of the requested $100,000 is
 
03:53:01.710 --> 03:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
difficult for the Academy is our hope
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
that the amount of the required Bond
 
03:53:05.630 --> 03:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
might be reduced to allow the academy to
 
03:53:07.469 --> 03:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
get their license and then apply for
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
Grants since statute RSA 188 G3 only
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
requires a bond in the amount of 10% of
 
03:53:16.550 --> 03:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
the gross tuition income we ask that you
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
re-examine the amount of the bond that
 
03:53:19.710 --> 03:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:53:24.630 --> 03:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
required um that um Academy never did
 
03:53:27.990 --> 03:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
open so I don't know what the what the
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
actual sticking point was so my idea of
 
03:53:36.189 --> 03:53:36.199 align:start position:0%
a Shorty Bond is that it's like an
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
insurance that you buy so you're if
 
03:53:41.349 --> 03:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
you're covering $100,000 you're not
 
03:53:44.990 --> 03:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
paying $100,000 to the insurance company
 
03:53:46.950 --> 03:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh you're paying uh
 
03:53:50.710 --> 03:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
for an amount so to say that they were
 
03:53:53.189 --> 03:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
stifled by
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh I don't know if that's what
 
03:53:57.790 --> 03:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
they would have had to put out I doubt
 
03:54:00.229 --> 03:54:00.239 align:start position:0%
very much if that's what it had to be it
 
03:54:02.910 --> 03:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
would be much much less to get the bond
 
03:54:04.429 --> 03:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
there's other ways of doing it too like
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
a letter of credit yeah or you could
 
03:54:10.189 --> 03:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
have an account set up with a local bank
 
03:54:10.199 --> 03:54:11.429 align:start position:0%
have an account set up with a local bank
yeah

03:54:11.429 --> 03:54:11.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah if for $100,000 you could
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
probably get a bond and much much less
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's under $100
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
right represent dry thank you I if we're
 
03:54:26.990 --> 03:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the shity things I I
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
really um our practical experience in
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
our family was I had a son at MacIntosh
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
college that was in the col the chef's
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
coron blue Chef's class uh he was the
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
last class before it closed if he was
 
03:54:41.469 --> 03:54:41.479 align:start position:0%
able to graduate but there was a very
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
real possibility that he would lose the
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
investment that he had made because
 
03:54:48.189 --> 03:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
Macintosh wasn't folded into the
 
03:54:50.469 --> 03:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
university system and actually had to
 
03:54:53.510 --> 03:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
close its doors so the idea of refunding
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
the tuition is important I mean that's
 
03:54:57.790 --> 03:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
important to students and we have an
 
03:54:59.990 --> 03:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
example in New Hampshire in the recent
 
03:55:00.000 --> 03:55:02.030 align:start position:0%
example in New Hampshire in the recent
past

03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
past
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
so so I'm thinking I I would I'm glad
 
03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're cutting that out but I think if we
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
approach that in the future um we really
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
have to Compare the numbers that they
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
were asking for compared to what's in
 
03:55:11.439 --> 03:55:14.389 align:start position:0%
were asking for compared to what's in
there

03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:17.070 --> 03:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
now well it's not eliminating insurity
 
03:55:18.510 --> 03:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
Bond it was
 
03:55:18.520 --> 03:55:24.750 align:start position:0%
Bond it was
modifying

03:55:24.750 --> 03:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.760 --> 03:55:33.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:55:33.950 --> 03:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
yeah right it went it went from covering
 
03:55:40.269 --> 03:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
the estimated to tuition costs for that
 
03:55:43.750 --> 03:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
year to down to 10% of
 
03:55:46.349 --> 03:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
it and I think it's important to keep it
 
03:55:48.830 --> 03:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
the way it is and not take that that out
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
well I think that's a great idea yeah
 
03:55:52.510 --> 03:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
the kid should get back yeah what they
 
03:55:52.520 --> 03:55:54.389 align:start position:0%
the kid should get back yeah what they
put

03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
put
 
03:55:57.429 --> 03:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
in I think it would be strengthened if
 
03:56:01.030 --> 03:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
you specified that that has the priority
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
because what happens in that chaos is
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
other people start grabbing it any money
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's available so you have to SP ify
 
03:56:12.189 --> 03:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
the priority compensation first will go
 
03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
to the demn ification of the students
 
03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
you really have to spell it out because
 
03:56:19.389 --> 03:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
it'll pay 100 hands grabbing for that
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
money and they'll all have lawyers but
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's why in the other Bill the
 
03:56:24.830 --> 03:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
dissolution of
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
Charters it said that those other assets
 
03:56:29.429 --> 03:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
no we're not going to be liable for that
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
and the state wants its money paid back
 
03:56:34.630 --> 03:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
on that state
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
allocation for that exact reason and I
 
03:56:41.149 --> 03:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a good good policy have in
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
place so I would leave it the way it is
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.040 --> 03:57:05.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.439 --> 03:57:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
meet

03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
meet
y

03:57:13.030 --> 03:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:14.269 align:start position:0%
 
that's

03:57:14.269 --> 03:57:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:57:18.670 --> 03:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.790 --> 03:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
o'clock yep that's full on the 12th we
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
got yeah the 36 in the morning and
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
depending upon what we're
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
told you know we will handle the mental
 
03:57:32.429 --> 03:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
health bills if they're scratching all
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
306 just on on that day yes because if
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it right we shouldn't
 
03:57:46.710 --> 03:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
have Fred in here for a half hour an
 
03:57:54.750 --> 03:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.750 --> 03:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
separate if it's
 
03:58:05.070 --> 03:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
necessary if it's necessary um I don't
 
03:58:06.429 --> 03:58:06.439 align:start position:0%
know what Fred's going to present to us
 
03:58:08.990 --> 03:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
but we got two hours to hear that then
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have an hour break and then we'll
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
have the three bills to take up and
 
03:58:15.030 --> 03:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
based upon what we hear in the morning
 
03:58:16.910 --> 03:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
it will help us make a decision in the
 
03:58:19.110 --> 03:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon if he's taking mental health
 
03:58:20.630 --> 03:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
out of
 
03:58:23.070 --> 03:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
306 means our afternoon work is going to
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
be a little bit more
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.990 --> 03:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
coming no no that was going to be a
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
followup if depending upon where we
 
03:58:38.149 --> 03:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
go yeah I talked to Mel about that on
 
03:58:40.349 --> 03:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
the horn the other night that we want to
 
03:58:44.189 --> 03:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
really that morning have brat in he
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
takes that much time in some of those
 
03:58:50.149 --> 03:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
hearings and talk about the people who
 
03:58:54.229 --> 03:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
were involved in developing the B6 PL
 
03:58:56.670 --> 03:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
and what competencies are talk about
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's in the plan
 
03:59:01.710 --> 03:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to know representative
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
Tanner and I both heard Christine Donley
 
03:59:07.269 --> 03:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
present in planfield a couple weeks ago
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
she was very formative I really think we
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
would all get some perspective from her
 
03:59:15.030 --> 03:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
if we had the opportunity I would
 
03:59:18.630 --> 03:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
happily engage with her
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
again I doubt very seriously if we're
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to have all the mental health
 
03:59:25.149 --> 03:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
stuff done that quickly and that's the
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
12th and we still have several weeks
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
following in the month to wrap it up
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
that's when Christine would come in I
 
03:59:34.510 --> 03:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't necessarily saying on the 12th
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
yeah just saying it would be good for it
 
03:59:36.239 --> 03:59:37.429 align:start position:0%
yeah just saying it would be good for it
to

03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:59:37.439 --> 03:59:40.349 align:start position:0%
to
happen

03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
so to for us to meet again and try to
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
get some recommendation you get these
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
amendments made you're going to have to
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
have some time to throw an amendment
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%

04:01:30.670 --> 04:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
I come later what time's the
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
9:30 could come in the afternoon I mean
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
I probably get here by late morning so
 
04:01:43.590 --> 04:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious whether I can come
 
04:01:43.600 --> 04:01:44.710 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious whether I can come
because

04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
some sometimes you can't
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
come oh no
 
04:01:58.590 --> 04:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.159 --> 04:02:14.349 align:start position:0%
 
forgiveness

04:02:14.349 --> 04:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
I couldn't hear you over here I was
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
going to say well if I got here late for
 
04:02:22.030 --> 04:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
what's already scheduled you could
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
technically already be done by the time
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
I get here so I'm suggesting maybe
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
in that meeting starts
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
at I know I've had have to ask Ruth
 
04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
Ward but I I don't think it's really uh
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a long meeting at all so I
 
04:02:53.830 --> 04:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
could even skip it come get something
 
04:02:53.840 --> 04:02:55.070 align:start position:0%
could even skip it come get something
done

04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:02:57.870 --> 04:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
here maybe the afternoon session like at
 
04:03:00.510 --> 04:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
12:30 1:00 depending on what other
 
04:03:00.520 --> 04:03:03.550 align:start position:0%
12:30 1:00 depending on what other
people

04:03:03.550 --> 04:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.309 --> 04:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
think what time can you get
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:11.359 --> 04:03:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%

numerous bills remember the special
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
education Advocate through HHS
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
and and there was a a problem in hiring
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
that advocate The Advocate has now been
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
hired I understand that's where a lot of
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
the issues that parents have can be
 
04:07:18.110 --> 04:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
directed in that direction now
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
um I for one thought we were getting
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
pretty close to getting this thing
 
04:07:23.359 --> 04:07:28.590 align:start position:0%
pretty close to getting this thing
resolved

04:07:28.590 --> 04:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:33.670 --> 04:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
um yes we did discussion that we had
 
04:07:33.680 --> 04:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
um yes we did discussion that we had
perhaps

04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
to oh she did that already
 
04:07:49.840 --> 04:08:06.630 align:start position:0%
to oh she did that already
today

04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:36.600 --> 04:08:49.660 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:08:49.660 --> 04:08:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.670 --> 04:09:01.790 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of it not the health specific
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
treatments but
 
04:09:08.080 --> 04:09:09.030 align:start position:0%
treatments but
inter

04:09:09.030 --> 04:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
inter
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:21.710 --> 04:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
that apparently we are live and Glen
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
anybody well let's go down through 147
 
04:09:43.109 --> 04:09:43.119 align:start position:0%
one more time then here here's what we I
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
think which we all agreed upon we agreed
 
04:09:51.950 --> 04:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
that oh before I say it why don't we let
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the people are going to write tell us
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
what we
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
correct Mike Mike yep we agreed to one
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
Senator yes uh let me get I got it here
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
we agreed to two representatives of
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
which one would be from the education
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
yep use your
 
04:10:36.990 --> 04:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
mic uh the other piece of it was um
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
allowing parents to serve dual roles yes
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
we kept the um and that was going to be
 
04:10:45.309 --> 04:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
information we got back from Rebecca
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
right whether we could do that or not um
 
04:10:51.790 --> 04:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
it reduced it to one teacher uh it added
 
04:10:53.670 --> 04:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
back disabilities rights Center in the
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
parents information center we're down to
 
04:10:56.760 --> 04:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
parents information center we're down to
one

04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
student and the correction we added the
 
04:11:06.429 --> 04:11:06.439 align:start position:0%
correction officers right kept the
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
correct both we have to do F because it
 
04:11:12.429 --> 04:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
said it it was required by the
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
idea I have I have a question about that
 
04:11:18.189 --> 04:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
one Margaret okay stop with f okay for a
 
04:11:18.199 --> 04:11:19.070 align:start position:0%
one Margaret okay stop with f okay for a
second

04:11:19.070 --> 04:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
Katie because if you look at the
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
um this from idea which it say and under
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
membership it says
 
04:11:35.469 --> 04:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
state state number five state and local
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
education officials including official
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
who carry out activities under subtitle
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
B of title 7 I'm wondering
 
04:11:46.510 --> 04:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
if um
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
on if we're looking at chap uh
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
186 um line E and F if that's the
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
same like if it's redundant so if one
 
04:12:01.790 --> 04:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
one State education official and one
 
04:12:04.149 --> 04:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
local education official is the same as
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
state and local education officials line
 
04:12:09.830 --> 04:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
five on the
 
04:12:13.429 --> 04:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
three the membership requirements under
 
04:12:16.710 --> 04:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
ieda is there argument was that it says
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
officials and that's why we needed two
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
and not just one that was their argument
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
so I had that we crossed out the one
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
local education official who shall be an
 
04:12:29.229 --> 04:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
administrator appointed by the governor
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
I have that we cross that out is that
 
04:12:30.920 --> 04:12:32.670 align:start position:0%
I have that we cross that out is that
not

04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
right keep it keep it they wanted to
 
04:12:38.670 --> 04:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
keep that I wanted to keep it both
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
because in what representative pedal
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
just referenced it says officials and it
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
also says state and local it doesn't say
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.479 --> 04:12:52.429 align:start position:0%
 
local

04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
and we we didn't
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
decide we decided not to have a
 
04:13:02.590 --> 04:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
clerk um I didn't get I don't think we
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
had a really lot of discussion a clerk
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
is somebody that can be appointed well
 
04:13:08.590 --> 04:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
from a member that's there Katie yeah
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
Katie was saying that if we what they
 
04:13:12.429 --> 04:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
wanted was a clerk from the Department
 
04:13:14.830 --> 04:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
of Education which was estimated at
 
04:13:19.109 --> 04:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
$50,000 no no no no what they're trying
 
04:13:22.030 --> 04:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
to decide is that was an OP that was a
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
possibility but but this would say the
 
04:13:26.189 --> 04:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
chair you elect the chair and the clerk
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
just like you do on here and that was
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
what they sounded said yes as long as we
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
clerk which is the which they could do
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
right now right exactly have a stat say
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a secretary or
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
whatever well you know it's been it's
 
04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
been a difficulty and I think they think
 
04:13:48.349 --> 04:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
this solves a problem they have a
 
04:13:48.359 --> 04:13:53.790 align:start position:0%
this solves a problem they have a
CLK

04:13:53.790 --> 04:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.750 --> 04:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it was just an attempt to
 
04:14:00.670 --> 04:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
solidify that the clerk was somebody
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
nominated from that committee anded and
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that in the past there had been an
 
04:14:10.149 --> 04:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
attempt to find an doe employee to take
 
04:14:12.109 --> 04:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
the minutes and that this would
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate that occurrence in the
 
04:14:17.149 --> 04:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
future um apparently when they
 
04:14:18.990 --> 04:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
reorganized last night it was done by
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
the committee so I don't have that
 
04:14:23.469 --> 04:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
history I can only go judge by going
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.309 --> 04:14:29.319 align:start position:0%
happening well really doesn't make any
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
difference whether it's in or out you
 
04:14:33.070 --> 04:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
know a committee can do it or you can
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
put it here and they they'll still do
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
the same thing it be elected by the
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
majority people in the
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
counil but if we do it here then they
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
won't have that discussion in the future
 
04:14:45.870 --> 04:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
of wanting somebody from outside because
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
they'll know it comes from them right
 
04:14:51.070 --> 04:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not trying to run the
 
04:14:52.830 --> 04:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
meeting for them I know we're just
 
04:14:57.550 --> 04:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
trying to make it less it it it will
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate like Alicia's correct them
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
from requesting Monies to have somebody
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
to take the
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
notes because to be elected from a
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
Council are we still on G did we put
 
04:15:17.469 --> 04:15:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
teachers I think that was a required
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.000 --> 04:15:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
required

04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so you have to have two so that has
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
to go back in that was they were trying
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.109 --> 04:16:04.119 align:start position:0%
two and what about t did we keep the
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
health provider in
 
04:16:05.920 --> 04:16:10.269 align:start position:0%
health provider in
there

04:16:10.269 --> 04:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but remember I think the a little
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
bit more in the majority sorted taking
 
04:16:16.429 --> 04:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
it out
 
04:16:20.830 --> 04:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
10 yeah but it was pretty even yeah I
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss that before we
 
04:16:25.030 --> 04:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
vote on that again as to why to leave it
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
in they're saying they don't need it
 
04:16:28.790 --> 04:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
because they don't need to hear from
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
them because they can call an expert but
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
that wasn't why they were put in there
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
to begin
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:38.910 align:start position:0%
to begin
with

04:16:38.910 --> 04:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.429 --> 04:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if the Le uh medical
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
person should not be an advisory member
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee therefore calls upon
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
just to rule on is this good health
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
practice or
 
04:16:55.030 --> 04:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
not I don't think that was that was not
 
04:16:58.429 --> 04:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
the that was not the point well I
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
thought it was I thought it was
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
important that they have that ability to
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
get that advice and that knowledge but
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
remember I said one local Health
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
provider who shall specialize in working
 
04:17:11.590 --> 04:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
with children such as a pediatrition
 
04:17:14.550 --> 04:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor as a nonvoting
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
member right um I guess
 
04:17:22.590 --> 04:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's in talking to various of the
 
04:17:27.149 --> 04:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
people including Moren afterward I
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
mean Kaitlyn thank you
 
04:17:30.960 --> 04:17:34.429 align:start position:0%
mean Kaitlyn thank you
afterwards

04:17:34.429 --> 04:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
um the people who were here at the desk
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it as in what do they
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
need and they can go out and
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
get uh special you know they can invite
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
people in but this was there was a need
 
04:17:52.630 --> 04:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
and I guess it was more
 
04:17:56.469 --> 04:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
complicated partly to get the the
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
information back to the
 
04:18:01.389 --> 04:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
pediatricians from there just like we
 
04:18:04.030 --> 04:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
want somebody on their committee to
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
who's part of Education to come and tell
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
us what going on so that was part of it
 
04:18:10.990 --> 04:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
but part of it I guess there is quite a
 
04:18:15.229 --> 04:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
bit of issue with legal paperwork
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
information all kinds of stuff that
 
04:18:19.349 --> 04:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
they're running into problems with and
 
04:18:19.359 --> 04:18:20.710 align:start position:0%
they're running into problems with and
having

04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
having
 
04:18:23.149 --> 04:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
somebody and it doesn't have to be
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
specific to a
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
particular disability but somebody who
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
has to deal with all of that stuff the
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
legal issues and all of that having them
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
on the committee to bring up up those
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
issues and that's one of the one of the
 
04:18:41.389 --> 04:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
things I guess that's been a problem
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
that that um is the other part of the
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
reason why they put that in
 
04:18:52.469 --> 04:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:54.670 --> 04:18:54.680 align:start position:0%
government I don't
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
know well the impression I got was the
 
04:19:01.950 --> 04:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.469 --> 04:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we all are at the same
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
meeting this
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
morning as I said I talked to a bunch of
 
04:19:26.830 --> 04:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
them afterwards including Caitlyn kutab
 
04:19:30.109 --> 04:19:30.119 align:start position:0%
who was telling me why they had put that
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
in there and it wasn't what the people
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
who we spoke to who sat at the desk it
 
04:19:38.630 --> 04:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't what they were looking at that is
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
not why she put it in and so they were
 
04:19:42.510 --> 04:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
looking at two different completely
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
different reasons for having a
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
physician why don't you get two
 
04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendments made one with it in one with
 
04:19:49.199 --> 04:19:50.710 align:start position:0%
amendments made one with it in one with
it

04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:19:55.189 --> 04:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
good count all the number of people at
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
the table here and we're spending hours
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.920 --> 04:20:05.550 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%

can last more than 30 minutes period
 
04:20:14.070 --> 04:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
