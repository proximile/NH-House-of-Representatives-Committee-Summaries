it to be a medical necessity
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%

those views and needs as we go forward
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%

this last week and the age of 98

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
i really am passionate about this issue
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
it started in 2016 for me when i ran
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
again for the house of representatives
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
here in derry and we had some
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
problems with our election and
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
better and have been improved upon and
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
things are much better in my community
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
but it it was a real wake-up call for me
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
and really made me see the importance of
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
election integrity
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
and how important that is for the
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
community to see
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
that elections are run well because they
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
were the issues
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
that was the issue that i would say
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
people in my community talk to me about
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
and we're most concerned about so it's
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%

um in the interest of full disclosure um

i think we have a lot of attorneys on
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
all the attorneys practicing are retired
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
please raise their hand and i see the
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
whole picture can i do a whole picture
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
so we've got one two three
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
three hands up there so uh we are in
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous territory i just heard
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
somebody ask about the whole picture
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
um pam are you with us
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes um i'm
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take a break right now you
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
want to go through
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
the options for screen in case
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
we don't have everybody on the tile
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
format or do we have
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
options yes you've got two options
 
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.669 align:start position:0%
options yes you've got two options
between

00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
speaker view and gallery view
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we definitely um recommend gallery
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
view so you can see
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
all the different files and how would
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
you do that
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
on the upper right hand um
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
side of my screen there's the toggle
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
or ability to go between speaker view
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
and gallery view sometimes it says
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
speaker view or sometimes you see a
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
grid with all the little you know like
 
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.789 align:start position:0%
grid with all the little you know like
like

00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
nine squares like a telephone pad grid
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
like a telephone pad so if you toggle
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
um you should be able to
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
choose your gallery view and if you were
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
on gallery view the person speaking will
 
00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:22.470 align:start position:0%
on gallery view the person speaking will
be

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
highlighted in some format so
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
your screen right now because i am
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
talking my screen is showing a sort of
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
yellowish green
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
frame around it so if someone is talking
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
and you're not sure who it is
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
if you just do a soft eye look at the
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
screen and look for that highlight
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
um narrow in on who it is that's
 
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.390 align:start position:0%
um narrow in on who it is that's
speaking

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
and of course we've all learned that
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
on the bottom left you have the ability
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
to stop the video
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
and keep your microphone on
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and you can also obviously click
 
00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.990 align:start position:0%
and you can also obviously click
yourself

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
back on we appreciate that there might
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
be things during committee meetings that
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
you need to take care of um
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
when we are physically in session there
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
are times that people have to get up and
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
leave the room during
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
discussion or public comment um
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
and we need to sort of decide i i think
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
maybe um if you've got your camera on at
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
that point maybe you
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
we need to sort of figure out what works
 
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
we need to sort of figure out what works
better

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not leaving a blank
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
screen on makes more sense so we know
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
you're not there
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
or whether or not it makes more sense to
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
just turn the video camera off
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
um that may be a little bit of personal
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
preference but
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
i think we'll sort of figure those
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
things out as we go along does anybody
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
else have any questions
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
about the actual operation of the zoom
 
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
about the actual operation of the zoom
screen

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
yeah the only other feature that that is
 
00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:57.430 align:start position:0%
yeah the only other feature that that is
especially

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
important is the raised hand feature and
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
presume everybody knows how to to raise
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
their hand
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
but in case you just need a refresher
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's down at the bottom of the
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
participants list
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um as an option
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i know it's different on different
 
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.029 align:start position:0%
and i know it's different on different
different

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
systems like if your ipad or phone it
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
may differ
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
but um that's important and as as while
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
highlighted screen i just want to say
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
that i i've been turning my video off
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
um during you know one once that meeting
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
gets going
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not gone i'm right here but i am you
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
know answering email and doing some
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
other things which i find distracting to
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
you know for you to see me moving around
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
answering the phone
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
that's the only reason i'm turning my
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
video off
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
so certainly if you ask me something
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll respond
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you for that all right if if
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
members have questions about how to do
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
the zoom or what's going on or what
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
they're seeing um i'm going to ask you
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
to interrupt right away
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
especially on these first few meetings
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
things are going to pop up you're going
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
to have questions
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
and it's better to get them resolved
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
right away and if you're having the
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
problem it probably means somebody else
 
00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:17.269 align:start position:0%
problem it probably means somebody else
has

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
either at that moment or in the future
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
all right we have a few more members
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
i just um the other thing is
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative hayward we've been
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
um emailing back and forth with him
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if he got the latest
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
email because he's on his phone it's
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's um
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's been a challenge for him to listen
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
i think and and also look at his email
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
hayward if you could try signing off
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
just just hanging up and dialing back in
 
00:25:46.159 --> 00:25:47.029 align:start position:0%
just just hanging up and dialing back in
again

00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're thinking maybe you could just have
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
a bad connection and you'll be able to
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
unmute and mute yourself
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
if you get a better connection so
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
or you know he's i'm able to communicate
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
with him by email he says he can hear
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
everything but he just can't unmute
 
00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:05.510 align:start position:0%
everything but he just can't unmute
himself

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
himself
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
all right so if you can keep
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
communicating with him that would be
 
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.029 align:start position:0%
communicating with him that would be
great

00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%

madam chairman i just have a recent word
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
from representative hayward he's going
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
to remain as he is he
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
he's he tried hanging up and coming back
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
in one time and
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
and still has the same problem so he's
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
he's okay with just listening
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and you know hopefully we can come up
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
with a better solution for
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
the hearings on on friday clearly but
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
but he's going to stay this way
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
all right so good morning representative
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
hayward we're glad you can join us we're
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing uh a presentation
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so the committee knows i do expect
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
there to be some
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
screenshots so we're going to get some
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
practice and how to do that because i
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
need to tell you it
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
it annoys me terribly to have these
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
screenshots of the committee
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
and of the paperwork and not be able to
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
see the committee so we're going to see
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
how that
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
works um and in that regards
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh do we have i see that
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
um deputy secretary scanlon is with us
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
generally in the past what we have done
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
for orientation for election law is here
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state's office
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
election is a a little bit different
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
from other committees first of all law
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
is in our title election law and
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
we the state has a
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
division of operations that is
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
essentially devoted to the
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
administration of elections
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
the state through the secretary of
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
state's office administers its elections
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
and it administers its elections
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
entirely by law
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
not by rule you heard a reference
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
of i think representative growing
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
discussed what
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
he was in the senate he was on jail car
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
most agencies operate by rules
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
the elections in this state are governed
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
by statute and
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
so when we go to take a look at the
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
bills for next week you're going to see
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
some bills that go on for pages and
 
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.109 align:start position:0%
some bills that go on for pages and
pages

00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
and pages and that's because they are
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with the law
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
as it is currently codified and the
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
changes are made to that law
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
in specific form by word
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that what this committee decides to
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
bring forward to the body and what the
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
body passes
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
goes directly into law and is not
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
rule making by the administrative agency
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
so in that regards we asked the
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office to join us
 
00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:10.630 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office to join us
to

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
sort of bring us up to date every two
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
years when we reassemble it is
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
after a general election i am hoping
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be able to hear
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit about what the numbers were
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
for our election
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
this past fall in regards to
 
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.950 align:start position:0%
this past fall in regards to
participation

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm also hoping that we're going to
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
hear a little bit about what laws govern
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
our operation here in the state because
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
of course there are federal laws
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
that govern our general elections as
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
our municipal elections which we'll be
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with directly next week
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
pam is i see
 
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:52.710 align:start position:0%
pam is i see
that

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
dave scanlon and um secretary of state
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
gardner both appear to be in
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
separate links all right so i'm going to
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
try and promote
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
to a panelist both gentlemen
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of state secretary
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
gardner and
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
scanlan but i i can't the bottom of the
 
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.790 align:start position:0%
scanlan but i i can't the bottom of the
list

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
w garden oh
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay the other um handy
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
thing to do in this situation actually
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
is if
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
somebody in the attendees raises their
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
hand they pop to the top of the list
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that they're
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
alphabetical by their first
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
names which is you know sometimes you
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
know their first names but
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's easiest ask them to raise their
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
hand pop to the top of the list then you
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
can find them
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right and they will join my
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
panelists list
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
by in alphabetical order apparently is
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
that how this works
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
alphabetical oh i don't know how they
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
joined the book on my screen deputy
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
scanlon is showing up
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
towards the top and secretary gardner is
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay i mean which is fine i just want to
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
be able to find them
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
and because we just added them
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
they have gone to the end
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
of my tiles a board member committee
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
members will note
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh we now have more panelists than
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
tiles so if you go to the middle of your
 
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.270 align:start position:0%
tiles so if you go to the middle of your
screen

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
screen

um you know in the meantime uh through
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
this format
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
um before we get into our presentation
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
couple of housekeeping things we like to
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
be a resource for the committee
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the members of the committee to the
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
extent that we're able to
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
we do have some publications that the
 
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
veteran members of the committee
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
the newer members
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%

thicker and thicker every year and and
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh last session because of the covet
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
situation was no
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
exception to that but this is the the
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
bible for local election officials
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it is a product of the work that you
 
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.309 align:start position:0%
and it is a product of the work that you
do

00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
and after uh you know after the
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
second session of the biennium prior to
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
the elections
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
we put all the updates related to the
 
00:41:23.829 --> 00:41:23.839 align:start position:0%
election laws
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
in this booklet and then these are
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
mailed to every election official
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and then
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
helpful publication you'll find is the
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
political calendar
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
this is simply a two-year calendar but
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
it has all the important deadlines
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
and and the related statutes that
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
accompany those deadlines
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
related to anything with elections so
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
these will be dates for filing for
 
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.230 align:start position:0%
these will be dates for filing for
office

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know when the actual primaries are
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
held when the supervisors of the
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
checklist have to meet
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
the only information that is a little
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
lacking in here are dates related to
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 2 elections and the reason
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
for that is
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's flexibility in those dates at
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
the local level and so it's really
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for us
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
to just uh you know put that as a
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
calendar date in this publication
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
but otherwise this is a really helpful
 
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.150 align:start position:0%
but otherwise this is a really helpful
document

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
to have that you should be aware of um
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm just going to
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
jump over to the other office and help
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill get onto his screen
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
and uh so just give me deputy scanlan
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
before you go
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned emailing the office
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
is there an email address if people want
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
need to be sent the material you just
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
saw because they don't
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
have it yeah probably the best thing is
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
just email me directly
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
passed back in the mid 90s
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh that recreated that created you know
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
the official ballot form of town meeting
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and and that that moniker stuck
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and uh here we are a couple decades
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
later and you know that
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
activity that form of town meeting is uh
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
still referred to as senate bill 2. so
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
we have a senate bill 2
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
that could affect senate bill 2. you
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
have well you have senate bill
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
too yeah
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
i have to look at it more closely but
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
the senate bill two that is currently
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
before you
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
i believe is designed to help towns
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh get through the town meeting coming
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
to town meeting as compared to the sb2
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah with with concerns related to coven
 
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
yeah with with concerns related to coven
so

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that senate bill 2 is a portion
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
all right well we'll be hearing more
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
about that later thank you does anybody
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%

what election
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
voting machine were used
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
because he was afraid that if we were
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
using a certain type
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
it wasn't keeping track of all the
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
correct votes
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
that is a frequently asked question
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
after the last election and
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised with uh
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
voting equipment that is uh manufactured
 
00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:21.990 align:start position:0%
voting equipment that is uh manufactured
by

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
a company called dominion and
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
the the optical scan counting device
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
that is used in new hampshire
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
has been used for probably at least 25
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
years now they're they're
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
they're rapidly approaching the end of
 
00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:37.990 align:start position:0%
they're rapidly approaching the end of
their

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
functional life but they are still in
 
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
functional life but they are still in
use

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
as they are in use in vermont and
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
connecticut and
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know other places in new england
 
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.069 align:start position:0%
you know other places in new england
those

00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
dominion the company that has the
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
concerns raised about it
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
owns the intellectual property of the
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
accuvope machine
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is used in new hampshire even
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
though it had nothing to do with the
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of the machine
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
the firmware that is in the machine
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
which is a form of software
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
was not created by dominion and the
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
the memory cards that are used are not
 
00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:14.950 align:start position:0%
the memory cards that are used are not
uh

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
programmed by dominion but they're
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
programmed by a local vendor
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
known as lhs associates um
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the short answer to your question is
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh no those are not the machines that uh
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that the where the issues were raised
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
related to dominion
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh equipment and software um they've
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually been a really good workhorse
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
uh over the decades um occasionally you
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
know we have some accounts that
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that don't make sense but but 99.9
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
of the time as long as the voter
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
accurately marks the ballot
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
according to the instructions those
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
devices will count those ballots
 
00:47:58.319 --> 00:48:00.549 align:start position:0%
devices will count those ballots
properly

00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the archives okay but you're
 
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.829 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the archives okay but you're
all

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay hello
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
everyone it's a pleasure
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
to be with you the veteran members and
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
the new members uh this is a
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
your committee's a very special
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee in the legislature
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
and it has been over all the years
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
as chair griffin
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there are no
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
rules in this office and there's a very
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
important reason for that because
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the elections
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
the elections really belong to the
 
00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.069 align:start position:0%
the elections really belong to the
people

00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
and it should be elected representatives
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
of the people who make
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
the decisions about how their elections
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be conducted so
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
unlike how some of you have seen on
 
00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:56.309 align:start position:0%
unlike how some of you have seen on
television

00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
television
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
i've read of late where secretaries of
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
state have made this decision or that
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
kind of a decision
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
in this state it's not like that
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
and here's an example there are 18
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
articles in the new hampshire
 
00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.549 align:start position:0%
articles in the new hampshire
constitution

00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
that have the secretary of state in
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
those articles
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
there are 22 in the constitution
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
that have governor in the article
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's no other state department like
 
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.470 align:start position:0%
there's no other state department like
that

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that and there's only two others
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
that are even mentioned in the
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
constitution the state
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
treasurer and the attorney general but
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
for both of those offices there are not
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
additional articles mandating that they
 
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:49.270 align:start position:0%
additional articles mandating that they
do

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
certain things and so
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
this you know over the years uh
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's been some exemplary
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairs of this committee and i can't
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
think of any
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
that was it's uh of late it's not been
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
as easy
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
to deal with the committee because
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
within the last decade or so there have
 
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
within the last decade or so there have
been

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
outside groups that were never involved
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
before in elections elections committee
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
didn't have
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
lobbyists in there being paid to try to
 
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.069 align:start position:0%
lobbyists in there being paid to try to
get

00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
certain election related legislation
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
either passed or defeated
 
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that changed about 10 years ago and
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
and it has changed to some degree
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
the the committee
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
but this office works closely
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
with the committee uh and
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's important that
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
the individuals who create
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
the rules for the elections are directly
 
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:04.950 align:start position:0%
the rules for the elections are directly
accountable

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the people like you all
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
are in the districts that you represent
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm gonna uh
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
ask dave i'm gonna start with what
 
00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.030 align:start position:0%
ask dave i'm gonna start with what
happened

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
just a few months ago and
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire stands
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
compared to the rest of the states
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
so so i don't know how this screen is
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
sheriff i just
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
asked pam smarling if she could uh set
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
can everyone see that
 
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:17.770 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting anything no
 
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.390 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting anything no
[Music]

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
no i can't you can't see it okay okay
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
let's try this
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
looks good okay
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
i just noticed what's uh behind me i'm
 
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:50.390 align:start position:0%
i just noticed what's uh behind me i'm
actually

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
in a room in the state house on the
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
second floor
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh but i think this might have been done
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
by the senate
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
when what the background is
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
and and it's i'm the only one in this
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
room so this
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
this particular chart
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
you can see to the far right
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
2020. new hampshire
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
is highlighted in yellow and
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
again in this presidential election
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
we had the third highest turnout
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
in the country and it's based on
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
the number of votes that the highest
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
office vote and it's based on the voting
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
age population
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason that it's based
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
on that is because it's the only way
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
that you can go back
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
50 60 80 years
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
to get a true comparison of
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
the number of people the percentages
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
that were voting
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
because of late the last three or four
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
elections they've come different people
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
have come up with different denominators
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
but those don't allow you to go back to
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
get a
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
historical look so even though
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen that i've been told that this
 
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.870 align:start position:0%
we've seen that i've been told that this
election

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
it's been the highest in 100 years or
 
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh exactly the case
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see in this chart we go back
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
in this one to 1996 because that was the
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
first presidential election
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire had
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
election day registration at the polling
 
00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.069 align:start position:0%
election day registration at the polling
place

00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
and in sort of a
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
pinkish color uh is the state of oregon
 
00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason that that is highlighted
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
is because in 1996
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
oregon opted to get rid of its
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
election day registration at the polls
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
and decided to have everyone sent
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
a ballot who was a registered voter
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
for the election they do not have any
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
polling places
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
in oregon everyone gets a ballot by mail
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
as long as that person is a registered
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
voter and
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
they have multiple days and multiple
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
locations to return
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
that ballot so
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
in this from 96 to
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
every one of those presidential
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
elections oregon did that
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
their turnout has been lower than in new
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire now
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
the the second chart that sort of looks
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh goes back to 1976
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
that was the year i became secretary of
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
state through 1992
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
and you will see that oregon had
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
turnouts higher
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
in every one of those presidential
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
elections than new hampshire
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
and between 92 and 96 the secretary of
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
state of oregon tried
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
to convince me to go to all male voting
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
because he said that if we did it on the
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
east coast they were going to do it on
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
the west coast
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
and that we would solve the voting
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
problem in the country
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
because this would make it so that
 
00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
because this would make it so that
everybody

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
will vote and you can see so the
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
the first five presidential elections
 
00:57:31.839 --> 00:57:33.190 align:start position:0%
the first five presidential elections
that

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
that are included here where new
 
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.789 align:start position:0%
that are included here where new
hampshire

00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
was in the yellow and
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
the one time that we were below the
 
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.510 align:start position:0%
the one time that we were below the
country

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
was in 1984. and we learned a lesson
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
from that election
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
because on the ballot actually
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
there were more than one page
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
there were 13 constitutional amendment
 
00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
there were 13 constitutional amendment
questions

00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
and in many of the cities the ones that
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
had lever voting machines they only had
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
10 voting machines per ward so those of
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
you from manchester think about this
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
there were 10 places where you could
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
vote whereas now when you go into your
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
polling place in manchester
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's 60 or even 75 booths
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
that you can vote in so that's how many
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
people can vote at one time
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
in 1984 there were only ten
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
and with the questions people were in
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
the booth
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
longer because they had a page and a
 
00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:33.910 align:start position:0%
longer because they had a page and a
half

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
half
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
of that had these 13 questions
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that was the only time so even
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
though all day long the news reports
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
were that it was massive turnout in new
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire no one had seen anything like
 
00:58:45.119 --> 00:58:45.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire no one had seen anything like
this

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
there were lines everywhere in the state
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
and it turned out to be the lowest of
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
our turnouts
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we learned from that and the
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislature dealt with that you can't
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
have more than three questions
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
at a time so that's the
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
the green line on the right of the one
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that's sort of the
 
00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.430 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that's sort of the
demarcation

00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
demarcation
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
when we then went to 96
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
you see the complete reverse that
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in 96 went ahead of oregon
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
and we have been a
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
head of oregon in every election since
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
and when you read national stories you
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
will often
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
see that oregon is considered by the
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
academic experts said that's the best
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
place in the country because that's the
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
the least effort a voter has to make
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to vote and that countries
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
i mean the states should be like oregon
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
because that is the way to do it
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
and these this factual
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
data shows factually
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
what had happened so this time
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
we were you can you can see the states
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
that were have been above us
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
minnesota and maine
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
and what's that and wisconsin so if you
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
go back to
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
you go back to the last five you'll see
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
wisconsin was in third we were fourth in
 
01:00:17.319 --> 01:00:18.710 align:start position:0%
wisconsin was in third we were fourth in
2004

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
2004
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
and then we've been third but those are
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
the four
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
states and so what is the difference
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
well new hampshire does not have a
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
durational residency requirement
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
wisconsin has a 28-day residence
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirement minnesota has
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
30 days in its constitution
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
and but it also has in its statutes
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
20 days in a precinct
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
or what they call out there the place
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
you actually
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
vote and so that's the difference
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
between minnesota
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
and wisconsin and new hampshire and the
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
maine and new hampshire and you see
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
maine have been just
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
barely above us and then they've been
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
below us back in 12.
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
maine is not exempt from the national
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
voter registration act like new
 
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:15.750 align:start position:0%
voter registration act like new
hampshire

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
is because maine does did not qualify
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
to qualify to be exempt you had to have
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
election day registration at the polling
 
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.750 align:start position:0%
election day registration at the polling
place

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
and maine didn't have that they had
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
election day registration
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
but they didn't have it statewide at the
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
you could register but you have to go to
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
or some other place to register on
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
election day
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then go to vote so those
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
differences but those are the
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
considerable ones
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
so you can you can see in these chats
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
pull out any state you want and
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
do your own coloring in uh
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
whether the state has been on a
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
a a trajectory of going higher
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
or whether the state had been on a
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
trajectory of going
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
lower over the years and in blue you can
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
see where the country is
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
and so this shot you can see
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
and then if you go back to the previous
 
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.630 align:start position:0%
and then if you go back to the previous
chart

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
dave can you do that okay the previous
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
chart you can see and now
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
so this and now so
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
go back prior to 76
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
and uh 72 is
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's just not here but it's available
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
you can come up if you have if you want
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
to come up and
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
look at it it's not really much
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
different but
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
look at the turnout uh for the country
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
it it in 52 it was 63
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
using the same denominators because
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's important
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
using the same denominators that we have
 
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.630 align:start position:0%
using the same denominators that we have
used

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
all these years and you can't go back
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
that early
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
unless you use voting age population
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
which is the census bureau
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
number uh and highest vote because
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
for highest office and i happen to know
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
the person in the 70s
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
who work for congressional quarterly who
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
was given
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
over a year to just travel to the states
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the country that had not provided
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
the information back in the 50s and the
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
60s some states didn't
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
do all get all the kind of statistics
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
that others did and so in order to have
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
it for the country he was given the
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
and when he finished it he sent it up to
 
01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:56.470 align:start position:0%
and when he finished it he sent it up to
me

01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's how i have it and then it was
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
published by the congressional research
 
01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.309 align:start position:0%
published by the congressional research
service

01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
this so these compilations come from
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
those statistics
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
in this if you had looked at
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
the turnout for the country
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
in this election based on this
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
so look back at 52 it was 63.8
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
56 60 64
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
and 68. so for new hampshire
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
we were 72.2 this time
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
compared to 61.4
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
for the country so if you look at new
 
01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
for the country so if you look at new
hampshire

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
compared to the country in 52 we were
 
01:04:51.799 --> 01:04:53.549 align:start position:0%
compared to the country in 52 we were
78.2

01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
78.2
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
75.2 78.7
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
72.4 so the new our turnout in this
 
01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.109 align:start position:0%
72.4 so the new our turnout in this
election

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
was the highest since 1964
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
because we had 72.2
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and in 64 we had 72.4
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
uh so that's
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
how our numbers compare to nationally
 
01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
how our numbers compare to nationally
now

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
when you think about this i compared the
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
difference between minnesota wisconsin
 
01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
difference between minnesota wisconsin
maine

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire what is the difference
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
between new hampshire then and the
 
01:05:34.839 --> 01:05:36.390 align:start position:0%
between new hampshire then and the
country

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
so three of those presidential elections
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
in the 50s and 60s
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
had higher turnouts than
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh than the country
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
and how did people vote
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
in those five presidential elections in
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you had to be a resident
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
of the state for six months
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
town and city clerks could not do voter
 
01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
town and city clerks could not do voter
registration

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't come until the 70s
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
back in those two decades you could
 
01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:12.309 align:start position:0%
back in those two decades you could
register

01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
twice a year that's all the law required
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
two days and they were around the time
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
of the election
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
now towns could the supervisors could do
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
it more if they
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to but that's all that was
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
required in the law
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
and you had to pay a poll tax in order
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to vote
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
in these five presidential elections
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
so by looking at it you can see
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the will of those
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
who could vote existed because
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
they did there were a lot of
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
people who could have voted during those
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
five presidential elections but weren't
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
because of provisions in their states
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
and yet their numbers as part of the
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
voting age population were included
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
so even though a substantial number of
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
the population
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
was not able to vote the voting age
 
01:07:15.039 --> 01:07:16.630 align:start position:0%
was not able to vote the voting age
population

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
compared to the turnout for highest
 
01:07:19.839 --> 01:07:21.910 align:start position:0%
compared to the turnout for highest
office

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
was for three of them
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
out of the five and we're more
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
than we have had since in the country
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
as a whole has had since with all the
 
01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:38.470 align:start position:0%
as a whole has had since with all the
changes

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
that have taken place since those two
 
01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.510 align:start position:0%
that have taken place since those two
decades

01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that's a uh certainly a challenge
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
how to bring back the will
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
of the people in this country
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
who can vote to vote
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's where we are and then uh
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
not quite three weeks after but the
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
granite state poll was conducted
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
at the universities and they did
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
they did this survey before the
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and after the
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
and they did it again in november before
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
the general election and after the
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
general election
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
very substantial uh statistics came out
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
that were very similar both for the
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
for this for the past november election
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm going to bring one of them
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
there's others like accuracy
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
how the people of new hampshire feel
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
about their
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
vote is it actually counted the way they
 
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.269 align:start position:0%
vote is it actually counted the way they
cast

01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
cast
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
and uh extremely high compared
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the country and this
 
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:09.749 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the country and this
question

01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
ease of voting was asked back in the
 
01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.189 align:start position:0%
ease of voting was asked back in the
winter

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
winter
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
and again in november and
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's remarkable that if you i think
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
it's cutting off the but
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
those who voted by absentee this was a
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
poll if you had looked at
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
the first page over 1900
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
were polled about this and they were
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
asked before the election
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
what they thought how easy they thought
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
it was going to be
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
and how accurate and then after the
 
01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:45.349 align:start position:0%
and how accurate and then after the
election

01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
and these are the numbers after
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
they're higher than before uh
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
they're really high so those who voted
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
by absentee ballot
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
and this time we had about 31
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
of the ballots were absentee in the
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
november election
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
and uh it came to about 262
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
000 out of 814 000
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
who voted those who voted absentee
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
if you add very easy 85
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
found it to be very easy and
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
13 founded
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat easy that's 98
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
and voting in person 90
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
found it to be very easy and nine
 
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.310 align:start position:0%
found it to be very easy and nine
percent

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
found it to be somebody just it's
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
actually a little over
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
99 now that that
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
is a reflection of the 814 000
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
people that actually cast ballots
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
whether by absentee or at the polling
 
01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
whether by absentee or at the polling
place

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty remarkable uh
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
that any poll that's in the 90
 
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.830 align:start position:0%
that any poll that's in the 90
percentile

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
percentile
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
is considered suspect
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
by those who did it but this
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
has not only been the case in november
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
but that was
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
also the case in the presidential
 
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.510 align:start position:0%
also the case in the presidential
primary

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
and this question has been asked by the
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
granite state poll in previous
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
years as has the question about how
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
accurate the people of this state
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's what happened uh in
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
november it was different because of the
 
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
november it was different because of the
pandemic

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of concern whether
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
how it would even take place
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
because of all the anxiety that existed
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we can report
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
to you statistic-wise
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
the polls a poll some people
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of faith and paul some people
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
have very little
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
faith but the statistics are
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
factual and
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
so uh this session
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
good luck we're all we're here
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
you have anything that you
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
any question that you might have uh
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully this building will be open in
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
a few months
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
and but you can come in
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh you have to just let us know
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
so that security will let you come in in
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
the morning
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the legislation
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the session last year the
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
only legislation
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
was regarding election laws that passed
 
01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
was regarding election laws that passed
was

01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
a legislation that was bipartisan in
 
01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.310 align:start position:0%
a legislation that was bipartisan in
nature

01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
where both parties had leaders of the
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
house and senate
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
come together and that and anything else
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
ended up not getting through
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
and what did get through was a big help
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
at the local level and
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
allowed new hampshire to
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
have the numbers that we had 814 000
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
is and and the numbers now on the
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know we're in the 90 plus percentile
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
of people that can vote
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
being on the checklist and
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
and in our voting age
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
our voting age population
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
includes people who aren't even eligible
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
it includes people in new hampshire
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated felons
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're part of the voting age
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
population but they can't vote
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the difference made
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire maine allows
 
01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
felons who are incarcerated
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
to vote so two years four years ago
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
we were in second place in the country
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
based the base when the denominator was
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
the voting eligible population we were
 
01:14:35.199 --> 01:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
the voting eligible population we were
second

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
and maine was third in that same
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
election based on voting age
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
maine was first and we were third
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
because when you allow more
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
people to be able to vote like maine
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
when the denominator is voting age
 
01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
they do better uh
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
and that's not uh and and in some states
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
where they have a higher percentage
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
than we do of people living in the state
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
but are not eligible to vote because
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
they're not u.s citizens
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
that plays that's a factor as well
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
but why we use voting age
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
is because it is the only way you can
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
have an historical perspective
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
and you don't read that in the national
 
01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:31.510 align:start position:0%
and you don't read that in the national
media

01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
media
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
you don't see this type of historical
 
01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
you don't see this type of historical
perspective

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
because for some reason
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
they don't want to use it and in the
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
last three elections
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
there are groups out there that have
 
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
come up with different denominators
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
rankings and but you can't go back
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
using those new type of denominators to
 
01:16:00.239 --> 01:16:00.950 align:start position:0%
using those new type of denominators to
get

01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
a true perspective from the past
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that's that's all
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
that i have at this point i'll get to
 
01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
that i have at this point i'll get to
see

01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
get to meet those of you who are
 
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.470 align:start position:0%
get to meet those of you who are
freshmen

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
freshmen
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
and congratulations a lot of you this
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%

important part because it's the one part
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
that affects everybody every person uh

the only part that they ever play as
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
part of their government
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%

machine and i know you've always been
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%

i know you will be over the next two
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
years so
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and one of these days i might
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
have one tenth of your ability to

have one tenth of your ability to
remember

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
numbers from free recall because it
 
01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:33.430 align:start position:0%

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
if i might just talk a little bit about
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
the the last election
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh because as you all know it was
 
01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.470 align:start position:0%
uh because as you all know it was
unprecedented

01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
unprecedented
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know having to deal with a pandemic
 
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.310 align:start position:0%
you know having to deal with a pandemic
crisis

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
something that every state in the
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
country had to do but uh
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know this all started about a year
 
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.870 align:start position:0%
you know this all started about a year
ago

01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
and very quickly we realized that
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
it was going to take a major effort to
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
be able to conduct an election safely
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know making sure that everybody all
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
the voters had an opportunity to
 
01:18:13.199 --> 01:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
the voters had an opportunity to
exercise

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
their uh right to vote safely
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
and so you know we started early on
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
communicating with local election
 
01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.350 align:start position:0%
communicating with local election
officials

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
officials
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh secretary gardner put together a
 
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
select committee on
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
emergency election support you were a
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
member of that from the legislature
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
along with senator sherman and some
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
other individuals that were familiar
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire elections
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
to take a look at the federal funds that
 
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.229 align:start position:0%
to take a look at the federal funds that
were

01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
being made available to support the
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
elections in new hampshire
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
and to help determine on how those funds
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
effectively spent and
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
after after all the great work on
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
on that committee uh input from local
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
election officials
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh new hampshire did end up spending
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
on ppe uh personal protective equipment
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
that was distributed to all the polling
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
places around new hampshire
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
and you know our the input that we heard
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
from voters and election officials was
 
01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:18.630 align:start position:0%
from voters and election officials was
that

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether it was the state primary or the
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
general election
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
generally the voters felt safe going to
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
the polling place
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
and approximately 70 percent of the
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
voters did do just that in both the
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
primary and the general election
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
additionally uh we ended up uh
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
giving about 2.6 in excess of 2.6
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
million dollars directly to the cities
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
and towns
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
in support of their efforts in
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
conducting the election
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh those monies were based on
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
the number of absentee ballots that were
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
sent out by the municipal clerks
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the costs that were associated with
 
01:19:57.679 --> 01:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
and the costs that were associated with
that

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
with with some of the federal funds we
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
hired an accounting firm
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
that worked with the the federal
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
government the election assistance
 
01:20:08.159 --> 01:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
government the election assistance
commission

01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we could come up with
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically a one-size-fits-all
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
formula based on absentee ballots as a
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
simple method to reimburse cities and
 
01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
simple method to reimburse cities and
towns

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
for the costs that they incurred and
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
so that was also a successful program
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
fortunately they have some ppe left that
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
you know that they're able to use in the
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
municipal elections and
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know hopefully that'll get us
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
through this year and beyond the covet
 
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
the crisis altogether um
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
we utilize this format zoom to
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
communicate with local election
 
01:20:46.159 --> 01:20:47.510 align:start position:0%
communicate with local election
officials

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
officials
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
it turned out to be an incredible tool
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
something that i'm sure that we will
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
continue to use for communication and
 
01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:55.350 align:start position:0%
continue to use for communication and
training

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
well beyond the pandemic that we're
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
at the moment um it was not unusual for
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
us to have
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh a couple hundred plus uh
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
participants on those zoom calls and it
 
01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:09.750 align:start position:0%
participants on those zoom calls and it
was

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
it was amazing the way that we were able
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
to communicate get the word out
 
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we saw through those communications
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh comments and input from local
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
election officials that boarded on panic
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the early days to just a really calm
 
01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.709 align:start position:0%
in the early days to just a really calm
uh

01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
sense as we approached elections where
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
they all felt prepared and ready
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
for the election and that was a very
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
rewarding thing to see
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
and and a big relief on our end too to
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know to see that get pulled off the
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
way that it did
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
um jumping over to uh an area that
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
some of you are familiar with but you
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
probably have questions about
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more about and that is the
 
01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.070 align:start position:0%
you'll hear more about and that is the
hava

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
hava
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
component of the secretary of state's
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
office our elections division
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
hava stands for the help america vote
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
act and
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
back in 2002 the federal government
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
passed some requirements through a
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
federal act that required every state in
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
the country to create a statewide
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
centralized voter database
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
something that you will hear commonly
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
referred to as election net
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
where all of the registered voters in
 
01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire are put
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
input into that system along with their
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
personal data
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
part of the help america vote act
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
required the
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
the um that we provide accessible voting
 
01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:36.390 align:start position:0%
the um that we provide accessible voting
equipment

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
in every polling place in the state of
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
and we are on the second generation of
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
those devices now um and
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh recently in the last election we made
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
some significant
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
upgrades to the ability for
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
individuals who are blind to be able to
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
vote by absentee
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh on home at home using their computer
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
as part of that process um
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government gave us uh
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
well at the time it was about 17 million
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
well at the time it was about 17 million
dollars

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
um we spent the money that was required
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirements
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
the mandates of the help america vote
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
act again creating the database and
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
providing the accessible voting
 
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
providing the accessible voting
equipment

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
but we have probably nine million
 
01:23:26.719 --> 01:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
but we have probably nine million
dollars

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh still in that account that where we
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
are using
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
the interest basically to continue to
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
the funds that are required from that
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
federal mandate so at this point
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
we have kept new hampshire from having
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
to dip into its general fund
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
to pay for something that is required by
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
the feds
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
and we hope to continue that well into
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
the future so that
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
these programs are paid for by federal
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
money and not state money
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's also about three million dollars
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
that was put into that fund
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago if you remember
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
before covid
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the big concern and crises uh
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the election arena was cyber security
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
and making sure that our election
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
systems are safe and secure
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
that you know we could reduce the risks
 
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.430 align:start position:0%
that you know we could reduce the risks
of

01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
being hacked especially by foreign
 
01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.629 align:start position:0%
being hacked especially by foreign
entities

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
entities
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire has done quite a bit
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
in that regard as well
 
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
you don't hear about it much now because
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
covet has taken the
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
screen front and center but we have done
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
quite a bit to safeguard
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
our uh our database systems related to
 
01:24:41.679 --> 01:24:42.390 align:start position:0%
our uh our database systems related to
elections

01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
elections
 
01:24:46.709 --> 01:24:46.719 align:start position:0%
and also the
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
the accessible voting equipment and and
 
01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
the accessible voting equipment and and
the

01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
um optical scan accounting equipment
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
that we can't use in the polling places
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
on election day so you know we can
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
answer more questions in that regard is
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
you have public hearings and these uh
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
these topics come up i
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
i looked at the number of bills that are
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
already assigned to your committee and i
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
see it's
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's up to 50 already so we're going to
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
be seeing a lot of each other
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
and um madam chair i don't know if you
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
have any questions that you want to ask
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
now or whether you just prefer that we
 
01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:18.070 align:start position:0%
now or whether you just prefer that we
wait

01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
wait
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh until the hearings but we're
 
01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh until the hearings but we're
available

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i'll ask um do committee
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
members have
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
any questions i do want to say that we
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
do have a hard stop
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
um coming up uh pam smarling has another
 
01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
um coming up uh pam smarling has another
meeting

01:25:33.510 --> 01:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
she has to do at one o'clock and i think
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
let her be able to log on early and have
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
some lunch um
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm more than happy to take questions
 
01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:44.629 align:start position:0%
so i'm more than happy to take questions
but

01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh keep in mind we're going to have lots
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
of opportunity i do
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
see a question um this is good practice
 
01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.070 align:start position:0%
see a question um this is good practice
so

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative trojan please
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you mr
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
scanlon for taking the
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
questions earlier dominion was brought
 
01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:01.990 align:start position:0%
questions earlier dominion was brought
up

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the conversation um and
 
01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.270 align:start position:0%
uh in the conversation um and
everybody's

01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
heard of the stories of some problems
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
with them and
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh and those machines being connected to
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
for various reasons it's my
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that the machines were
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
using a divo
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
you did mention earlier that um those
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
that company
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
that system is now owned by dominion are
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
any of
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
our towns or municipalities connecting
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
those machines to the internet
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh at all with the with the data you
 
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh at all with the with the data you
know

01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
the the vote count in the machine
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
at any time no the the answer is no
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
the all of the machines that are used in
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
are stand-alone devices and at the end
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the night
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
there is a results tape that is printed
 
01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.070 align:start position:0%
there is a results tape that is printed
out

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
if it is a community it uses multiple uh
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
devices uh they printed a results tape
 
01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:55.189 align:start position:0%
devices uh they printed a results tape
out

01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
for each device and then they they they
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
physically add those together
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
to it to uh to reach a total
 
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the modems that
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
can be in those machines have been used
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the machines that are in service
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and in addition to that
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
all of the external ports on those
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
devices have also been disabled
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
so the only cord that comes out of those
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
machines that can be plugged into
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything is
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
power cord and
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
and and so that's the state of the
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
machines that we use here
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
prior to their use in any given election
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh there is a memory card that is
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
provided by the vendor that services and
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
maintains those devices
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh that is tested uh prior to the
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
election to make sure that
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
the machine is counting boats properly
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
that card is left in the machine the
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
they're themselves in a bag where
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're not in use
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
all of the openings on those devices
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
have numbered seals on them and every
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
municipal clerk
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
is possibly required by statute to keep
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
a log of those seals
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
and uh make a note notation in the log
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
every time those seals are broken
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then the number of the new seal that
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
is placed on it
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of security that that
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
surrounds those devices
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
it was not to say that you know those
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
machines could not be
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
hacked somehow because any electronic
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
device we recognize can be
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
but but the the way that they are
 
01:28:41.679 --> 01:28:42.629 align:start position:0%
but but the the way that they are
maintained

01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
kept secure with logs kept of them
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduces the risk of
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
something nefarious
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
occurring and for something major to
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
happen in new hampshire would require
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
a significant conspiracy
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much well i am
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we'll be hearing a lot about
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
that as we go
 
01:29:07.110 --> 01:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
as we go on this year representative
 
01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.510 align:start position:0%
as we go on this year representative
lane

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh i recall last year
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
going to a couple different for the
 
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
voting machines that people came in and
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
showed the voting machines because
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about getting
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
because as you mentioned
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
our voting machines are kind of getting
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
long in the tooth
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh so i was just curious where
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
what you expect to see about that and
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
will we be
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
hearing about that more or what the
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
status of that is
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
we will certainly be hearing about that
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
that more um some of those
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
initiatives were put on the back burner
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
because of the covet crisis and
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
everything that we were dealing with
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the the the
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
the the issue with the vendors that
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
showed up was that
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're having difficulty finding just a
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
single standalone counting device
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
that will count balance and the the
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
vendors that
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
that came to the sessions that we had
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh where you know we were testing them
 
01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.669 align:start position:0%
uh where you know we were testing them
out

01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
have they they want to sell a package so
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's not only the machine that counts
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
the ballots but they want to sell their
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
software program
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
to go along with it that that designs
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
has a lot more bells and whistles than
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
we actually need
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
um that's not to say that we may not end
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know one of those entities in the
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
future it's just
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that we get what
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense for new hampshire
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we're going to be
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
talking about i'm sure this session is
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to be the e-pull books
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
and where that stands and
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know that is is moving along but
 
01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:54.390 align:start position:0%
you know that is is moving along but
slowly

01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
um you know there have been some
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
localities in new hampshire that have
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
tested those devices
 
01:31:01.830 --> 01:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
um and we've been able to see what the
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
benefits are that work well and but
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
we've also been able to see where the
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
flaws are
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
um and so that'll be that'll be part of
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
the discussion this year
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
and the other thing that we did recently
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of a bill that was passed
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
through the senate
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
that required us to test high-speed
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
scanners for auditing purposes
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
after the general election um
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh which which we did um and
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's some interesting
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
results i mean
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know the technology is really
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
improving and they were able to go
 
01:31:36.239 --> 01:31:37.189 align:start position:0%
improving and they were able to go
through

01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%

01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
new information
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
since this committee met last year
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%

meeting
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
you should have all received an email
 
01:34:05.199 --> 01:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
you should have all received an email
notice

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the meeting next week at 10 o'clock
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
you should have also received a email
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
from paul
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
smith requesting your preferred email
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
for notices
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
if you want to keep using your ledgey
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
email but you have another email you
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
would prefer
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
or you check more regularly i would
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
suggest trying to
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
set up an automatic forwarding of some
 
01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.310 align:start position:0%
set up an automatic forwarding of some
sort

01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
sort
 
01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm now way out of my lead league from a
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
technology standpoint but i know you can
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
do it
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you get those notices
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
you saw yesterday
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
how we had a hearing notice sent and
 
01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:48.629 align:start position:0%
how we had a hearing notice sent and
within

01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
an hour i think you had another hearing
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
notice sent that said revised hearing
 
01:34:53.679 --> 01:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
notice sent that said revised hearing
notice

01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
notice
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
and um it is difficult to keep track of
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on especially if it's
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
buried in your allegy email with all the
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
bulk email we get
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
so committee hearing next week
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
this committee won the lottery so to
 
01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.510 align:start position:0%
this committee won the lottery so to
speak

01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
and got the call to have the first
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
um we will be the first one and the only
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
one occurring next week for various
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
reasons in state health scheduling it
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
is scheduled for friday at 10 o'clock
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
as we get a little more depth with the
 
01:35:27.679 --> 01:35:28.950 align:start position:0%
as we get a little more depth with the
system

01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
we will probably discuss as a committee
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
moving up the beginning time to nine
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock especially if most people
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
are attending remote you will be able to
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
attend remote
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
for the meetings i will i am planning to
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
physically be
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
at the state house next week uh
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
you have the option to do so if you want
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
um i really want to be there to see the
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
setup really the public will not be
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to be in the building the
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
building is not open to the public
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
they have supposedly arranged double
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
committee rooms
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
with adequate spacing and
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
a large screen at the end of the tables
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
that will project something like we're
 
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:15.990 align:start position:0%
that will project something like we're
looking

01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
a so that if you are in attendance you
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to see that screen
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
we are have not
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
gotten any word that you would be
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring your own computer and
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
there are issues in regards to the
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
access to the format
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
that they're concerned about so you
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
would not be able to have a computer
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
at least at the table in front of you so
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
you would be looking at the screen
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the room so for many of
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
you you're going to find that this
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
format is
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
actually more useful there
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
the clerk will need to
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
do her duties as is normal i need to
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're sort of still working that out
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
veteran members recall the old pink
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
cards and sign up sheets
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that notices will
 
01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.070 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that notices will
go

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
out and if members of the public want to
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
testify in regards to a bill
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
there will be an ability to sign up
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
ahead of time
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i chairs will be provided a list
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
of people who want to speak before the
 
01:37:21.199 --> 01:37:21.910 align:start position:0%
of people who want to speak before the
meeting

01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
and i expect that the direction will be
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
if you sign up ahead of time
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to be recognized before
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
people who sign up on the day of the
 
01:37:30.239 --> 01:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
people who sign up on the day of the
hearing

01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
this is apparently a format that the
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
senate has been using
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
so we're going to give it a try here in
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
i will report on the setup and try to
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
maybe visually be able to
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
let people who are attending remotely
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
see what the room is set
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
up like the other issue is going to be
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
that during the meeting
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
we will need to have a technology person
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
doing what has been going on today
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing people who raise their hands
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing them to speak
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
um and trying to work it out the
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislative assistants will not
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
be available to run the technology
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
during the meeting
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough staff to provide
 
01:38:16.239 --> 01:38:17.109 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough staff to provide
the

01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
the research support that we need in
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
being in every room i will tell you that
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons i'm going in
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
next week is because i want to do
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
the technology piece of it during the
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
first public hearing so we can see how
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
well it's really working
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
to see what the feasibility is of having
 
01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
someone do that remotely because that
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
can be done obviously remotely i've been
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
doing it here this morning
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
i have significant concerns that if
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
i would rather be on site to resolve it
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to cancel any
 
01:38:57.440 --> 01:38:58.310 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to cancel any
meetings

01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
or reschedule anything because as you
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
heard we have 50 plus
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
bills so committee meeting next
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
week at 10 o'clock you'll be getting a
 
01:39:10.709 --> 01:39:10.719 align:start position:0%
zoom invitation
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
we ask that you log on early i am going
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
to try and start the meeting
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
early i mean start the meeting at 10
 
01:39:18.239 --> 01:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
early i mean start the meeting at 10
o'clock

01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
um and we have three bills
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
originally our public hearing was
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
scheduled for one bill
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
that was sb2 sb2 is the bill that has
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
already come out of the senate it is
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
amended to deal with issues as you heard
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
stated in regards to
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
our community elections and
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
annual meetings that start
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
really in february i believe some have
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
something scheduled at the beginning
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
end of january one of the reasons they
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
wanted that dealt with
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
quickly was because public notices
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
needed to happen for those meetings
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
and have already happened
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
however there was some discussion that
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
we should deal with this with a public
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing because to have dealt with this
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
bill right away
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
would have eliminated the ability to
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing on it
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
so sb 2 went to the top of the list for
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
that was scheduled for 10 o'clock next
 
01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.270 align:start position:0%
that was scheduled for 10 o'clock next
friday

01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
friday
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
as bills got processed the offices have
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
to take
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
care to make sure that bills going to a
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
second committee are taken
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
care of second committee bills are bills
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
that need to go to finance
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
generally and they need to be reported
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
out by february 18th out of this
 
01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:40.950 align:start position:0%
out by february 18th out of this
committee

01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
so there are two bills on our
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
list that need to go to finance one is
 
01:40:47.119 --> 01:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
list that need to go to finance one is
hb

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
hb
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
86 that is a recently added bill
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
and it does it is relative to voter
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
qualifications and registration
 
01:40:59.199 --> 01:41:01.189 align:start position:0%
qualifications and registration
procedures

01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the other bill that has a fiscal
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
note is
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
121 which is relative to independent
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
redistricting commissions
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
so as you know um independent
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
redistricting commissions have had
 
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.669 align:start position:0%
redistricting commissions have had
robust

01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
robust
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
public hearings but
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so i was reluctant to put that on
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
however given our attempt to try and
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
and not have them every day we're going
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be limited to
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
i think two days a week once committee
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
meetings get going
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we've put them all on for next week
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
i have optimistically scheduled them for
 
01:41:44.719 --> 01:41:45.030 align:start position:0%
i have optimistically scheduled them for
an

01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
hour each in the hopes we do not
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to take a lunch break because i'm
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about the technology
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
doing a break and coming back both for
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the public but we're gonna we'll do
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
that if we need to
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and once a hearing is noticed if
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're going way over
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
um the committees that the committee
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
hearings that follow as you know for
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
those of you who have been in person
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
they're just gonna start late and we'll
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
try to get a handle on that
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
to let people know if we think it is
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
going to go late
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
you can get the bills by going online
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
to the advanced bill search frankly i
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
find is the easier site
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
and go to election law bills and look up
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
i do not suggest printing them out i
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
will tell you that this
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
is the stack of bills and this is
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
largely double-sided printed
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
so um my suggestion would be
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
that you i'm a big paper person i want
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
to put them in a notebook and organize
 
01:42:54.550 --> 01:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
them i'm trying to hold back
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
um because we have more bills i think
 
01:42:57.440 --> 01:42:57.910 align:start position:0%
um because we have more bills i think
than

01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
i have i certainly have seen on election
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
law and i
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
suspect the most we have ever had
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
we will not be having an executive
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
session next week
 
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
you will notice that the calendar notice
 
01:43:13.350 --> 01:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
says there may be
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
but i will tell you as chair we will not
 
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.470 align:start position:0%
but i will tell you as chair we will not
be

01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
um there was because of the last minute
 
01:43:21.109 --> 01:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
nature of the scheduling the clerk's
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
office was not
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
sure about the executive session and
 
01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:25.270 align:start position:0%
sure about the executive session and
that

01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
um language was selected to go in
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
just to be sure we were covered if for
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
some reason
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
we did have an executive session but
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
given the number of public hearings we
 
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
now have i don't think a vote is likely
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
which means that
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
we will have to have another meeting
 
01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
before february 18th on or before
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
february 18th
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
i do not after our meeting on
 
01:43:56.709 --> 01:43:56.719 align:start position:0%
the 22nd i do not expect to be
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
scheduling a meeting before
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
february 1st and i am hoping to know
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
shortly what days of the week we have
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
been given
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
to hold our public hearings there is an
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
public access and scheduling
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
committees are going to be given
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
particular days of the week
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
it has also been requested that we
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
schedule bills to go
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
all day because of the number of bills
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
um i know like for like many of you
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
i sort of multitask and usually have
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
tried to have something else on my
 
01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:36.470 align:start position:0%
tried to have something else on my
calendar

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
on committee hearing days i'm not sure
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to be possible
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
as we begin this journey so
 
01:44:48.390 --> 01:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
with the january calendar
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
probably just being our meeting on the
 
01:44:50.719 --> 01:44:52.149 align:start position:0%
probably just being our meeting on the
22nd

01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
22nd
 
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
you can expect at least one meeting out
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
before the 18th and i will tell you that
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
there is not going to be a session from
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
what i've heard before the second week
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
in february
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
because really the first thing we need
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
to do as
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
a body is to deal with second committee
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
bills those don't actually have to be
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
voted on the body
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
by the body until the 25th and i
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
apologize for that ding i'm going to
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
have to have a conversation with
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
um it as to operating
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
the sound off my camera as compared to
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
my computer
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
my computer is telling me other things
 
01:45:35.590 --> 01:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
are happening i have no idea what they
 
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.030 align:start position:0%
are happening i have no idea what they
are

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that's i you know about all i know
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
about these committee meetings
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
and as soon as i know anything else
 
01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.229 align:start position:0%
and as soon as i know anything else
definitively

01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
definitively
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
i will send it out i know people are
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and attendance and
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
how that is going to happen
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
and as soon as i know
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
i will let you know but it's my
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
understanding they believe they have
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee rooms set up so
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
that some or all members would be able
 
01:46:06.639 --> 01:46:07.030 align:start position:0%
that some or all members would be able
to

01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
attend safely and just to repeat
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
i will physically be there next friday
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's the plan
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
because of my concern over making sure
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
we've got all the moving pieces set up
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
correctly for
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
our meetings so with that uh
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
