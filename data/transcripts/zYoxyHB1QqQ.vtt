the process and where we are on this
lease

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
sorry uh hi i'm charlie arlinghaus i'm
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of administrative
 
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
services and with me is uh jordan island
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
who's our real property manager um uh
 
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
jared will be the lawyer in the room
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
today um so that i don't say anything
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
that gets me in trouble
 
00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.190 align:start position:0%
that gets me in trouble
um

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
so people know i think that this is
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
about the parking garage
 
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't look like it's about the
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
parking garage but it is about the
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
parking garage um there's a there's a
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
plan the legislature has uh long
 
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
eyed the spot of the
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
savings bank building the
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
that it currently houses the department
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
of justice
 
00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
since we bought it in 1993 as a
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
potential parking garage to replace the
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
one on store street that is in less than
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
ideal condition
 
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
although perfectly safe if you happen to
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
be parking in it i just want to
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
 
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.230 align:start position:0%
emphasize that
but

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
has a very short life ahead of it it's
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
well past its useful life and
 
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.749 align:start position:0%
well past its useful life and
um

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
we pick up the concrete that falls a lot
 
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.590 align:start position:0%
we pick up the concrete that falls a lot
um

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
so to do so to tear down the department
 
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
of justice building which is what i'm
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to call it
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
you would have to move them out of it
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
or else tear down very carefully
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
to move them out of it you have to put
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
them somewhere um and they wouldn't
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
quite naturally like to all go in the
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
same place which is a very difficult
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
thing to do there are very few spots
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
in concord where you can fit
 
00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 000 square feet of people
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
people offices etc in office space the
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
only options realistically are
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
converting retail space
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
or this particular space that is the old
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
lincoln financial building or chubb life
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
if people remember it as that the old
 
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
building off rumford street
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
in concord up toward the prison
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
so we negotiated at least
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
and the legislature was actively
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
involved in negotiating the the least
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
terms of it were basically agreed to by
 
00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.270 align:start position:0%
terms of it were basically agreed to by
the

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
chief operating officer of the
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislature more than anyone else
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
um and we uh
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
and we said okay
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
um that's a good idea terry um which is
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
what i think most people do when they
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
talk to terry um and uh and so this is
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
the least what you have before you are
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
the terms it is a 20-year lease and
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's a within the lease there's an
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
option to buy there are two towers on
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that site right two buildings
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
um each um
 
00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:10.390 align:start position:0%
um each um
um

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
each roughly the same size they're both
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand square feet
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
they were built about ten years apart
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
the one currently houses in about half
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
of it the administrative office of the
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
courts and then a couple of uh sort of
 
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
non-public entities
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
in that the state has an option the
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch if you will so has an
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
option to buy that
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
that building which we may or may not
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
exercise someday i don't predict what
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
courts will do
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
or want to do
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then we would naturally have an
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
option on this i think i think there's a
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
school of thought that thinks that we
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
would buy this building
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
and the lease will specify that that's
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
about 15 million dollars which is
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the cost of
 
00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
building a hundred thousand square feet
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
probably a third of the cost of building
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand square feet
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
um but in the meantime
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
we have a 20-year lease
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
and it's uh it's 11 triple net lease but
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
the document before you is a great
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
summary of all the lease provisions
 
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.230 align:start position:0%
summary of all the lease provisions
um

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and in terms of having a
 
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
a reasonable office space for the
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
department of justice that suits them
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
and may in addition um suit some other
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
agencies we have you know significant
 
00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:20.710 align:start position:0%
agencies we have you know significant
needs

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
needs
um

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
this is a it's actually a fairly decent
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
building and it um has parking which is
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
i have to answer any questions i don't
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
want to go into way too much detail on
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
the lease but i'm happy to go into any
 
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
the lease but i'm happy to go into any
detail

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative clute here hey thank you
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i assume you you talk with the
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
department of justice and they think
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
that this uh
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
building would be adequate to their
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
needs for the foreseeable future they
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
think it is quite suitable they've been
 
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
over a couple times on a tour and yes
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
they do i think they think it's um
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
significantly more suitable to their
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
needs than their current space
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh commissioner i i know we
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
have like a an mou
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
in front of us at the moment
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
when do you
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate having the lease son and two
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
governor and council because if we come
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
in here in july and it's september or
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
october before you have a lease ready
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
several of us are going to be
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
miffed shall i say the the deadline for
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
the august meeting is um july 27th and
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
we will make we will meet that deadline
 
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
we will make we will meet that deadline
right

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you mr
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh good morning mr arlinghaus
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think i heard you say that the doj's
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
need was about 50 000 square feet the
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
building's about a hundred thousand
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
square feet so that opens up some
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
questions on the extra fifty thousand
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
square feet um bureaucracies have a way
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
of expanding to fill all available space
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's something i've learned in
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
corporations too
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and i'd like to know what we're going
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
to do to ensure that we don't find
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves expanding to 100 000
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
need when the need is 50.
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
specifically if you want to include this
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
in your answer um
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
are there any other target departments
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
that we can move
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
freeing up another building that we
 
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.750 align:start position:0%
freeing up another building that we
could

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh close out somehow
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
are we looking at any other departmental
 
00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:34.710 align:start position:0%
are we looking at any other departmental
moves

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
moves
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
um we it's actually a great question and
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
i agree with you one of the things that
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
keeps um
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
state entities from expanding into
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
available space
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
is the requirement that they that they
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
pay for the space so the space isn't
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
free there are there are charges in the
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
budget process that are transfers that
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
are rent-like charges we occasionally
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
call them rent even though they're not
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
rent or the their allocated portion of
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
the costs of actually of karen's
 
00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.509 align:start position:0%
the costs of actually of karen's
department

00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
um and so uh that sort of limits you i
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
mean there are people who would like to
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
who you know we have discussions with
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they're like oh we'd like to you
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
know we'd like to lease about 10 000
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
square feet and the first question is
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
always how much is in your budget and um
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh people who are newish will say oh
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
does that matter and the answer is
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
typically yes yes it does
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
um so that will prevent that from
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
happening i think that that our current
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
plan is to identify some areas where
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
there's significant
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
um uh renovation or maintenance need in
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
in in buildings the the state has a
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
number of buildings that are relatively
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
um mediocre
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
or that's not a good that's not a good
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
way of putting it that are in need of a
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
great deal of work either asbestos
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
remediation or or various other issues
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of hvac issues right
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
now for example
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that is an
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
obstacle to fixing that space routinely
 
00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
is um the availability of swing space
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to use as a as a
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
as a silly but directly
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
relevant to me example
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
um we have a capital project that that
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
dates from actually the 2019 capital
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
budget um but was suspended during the
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic because it's not critical it
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't critical
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
um but which is a significant um
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
overhaul of the state house annex
 
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.110 align:start position:0%
overhaul of the state house annex
building

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
the building built in 1939 and and which
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
hasn't had significant work and has
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
riddled with asbestos and bad wiring and
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we're doing a lot of work and you
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
know the architects will say to you well
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know what we could probably do this
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
if you could move about half the people
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
out of the building and i said what if
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
we could move out like 20 people at a
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
time instead of 200 at a time
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
and they'd look at you appalled and then
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
we do that one of the things we are
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
going to use some of the space for
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
because it is
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
when lincoln financial left they left
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
everything behind including all the
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
furniture which is unusual for us and as
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
a remarkable
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
asset to us is use it for for some of
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
that to take uh portions of people out
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
of buildings that we're renovating the
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
annex is a great example and put them in
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
there and then move them back
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so we are uh we're doing a lot of
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
space planning along those lines
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
karen and i for example met recently on
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
this and some of it is going to be
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
related to in terms of capital budget
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
and a couple of arpa projects
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
what are we fixing and that'll tell us
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
who's going to move but at the end of
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
as a result of this
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
no agency will have more square footage
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
than they have today
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
with with the one exception being doj
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
and if you've if you've been inside doj
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
you can see why that might be the case
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
and in addition there are more we have
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
more lawyers than we used to
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
so what i heard you say though is that
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
long term we're expecting we're going to
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
have an ongoing surplus of 50 000 square
 
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
have an ongoing surplus of 50 000 square
feet

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
feet
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
and that although that may be used in
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
the interim
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
for some some some flipping of spaces to
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
renovate other spaces long term it's
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
still 50 000 square feet extra
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
uh long term the state will have 50 000
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
square feet um yes but i think one of
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
the things we would do so we currently
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
rent something like 200 and
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
250 000 square feet of office space
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
around congress all right and um
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we would do
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
is is look to rent less if we're running
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
a larger space we would look if there
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
are entities that can move in there
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
there are people who are at the end of a
 
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.269 align:start position:0%
there are people who are at the end of a
useful

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
useful lease life and and sometimes they
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
either want to leave or have to leave
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so we would look at doing that
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of lease space i would expect
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
the state to have over the next let's
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
just say decade
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
is probably not going to
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
change dramatically would there be ups
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
and downs within that number yeah
 
00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.269 align:start position:0%
and downs within that number yeah
probably

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:58.150 align:start position:0%
probably
but

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
but
not

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
not dramatic ups and downs
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
you know 10 or 20 this way or that way
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i i think that
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we want to try to
 
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.389 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we want to try to
do

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
is you know ideally we would you know
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
the plan when we started renovating the
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
state office park south
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the gallon office park the old
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
hospital campus was to try to move
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
people out of rented space and they'd
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
actually been a you know it's the theory
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
when they built a state house
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
expansion when they built the annex et
 
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.990 align:start position:0%
expansion when they built the annex et
cetera

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
cetera
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we've done some of that you know if
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
you look at the old master plan we
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
renovate this building move them out of
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
the leaf space into into state space and
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think we'll get there but i don't
 
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
think the state's ever really going to
 
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.629 align:start position:0%
think the state's ever really going to
have

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
um uh quite as much borrowing a
 
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
um uh quite as much borrowing a
significant

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you and and to follow on um we
 
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
um thank you and and to follow on um we
heard

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
earlier this
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
last month i guess it was now at least
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
one agency is looking at buying another
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
building in concord to move out of
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
a building or a gallon that is
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
less than desirable it needs a lot of
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
work um those are the types of things
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure that the commissioner or
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
his successors will be looking at
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
not trying to get rid of you charlie but
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
i was gonna say
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
let's not talk about successes i would
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
make this request
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
um you have a representative who is on
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
this committee um
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
very ably on this committee i would
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
expect that at
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
the meetings of long-range
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
utilization committee
 
00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.470 align:start position:0%
utilization committee
that

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
items such as
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
what's going to be going in there what's
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
coming out of that building as we go
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
forward would be presented to this
 
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.749 align:start position:0%
forward would be presented to this
committee

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
and its new
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
construction after the next election and
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think that that's fair it gives the
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislature some oversight on what's
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
going on without being overly burdensome
 
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.150 align:start position:0%
going on without being overly burdensome
to

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.509 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:07.030 align:start position:0%
the
department

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
you know i happily can commit to that we
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
will we will uh uh tell you what's going
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
on as as often as you would like and
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
whenever you would like and um
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
we can do it without without almost any
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
notice and so you know karen's going to
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
be here anyway and she's going to know
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
senator burnsville
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you have any idea how is
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
there a cost to
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
renovating or retrofitting this
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
particular area for doj
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and how much is it if so how much is
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
it the the legislature in the in the in
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
the bill that the legislature passed and
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
which i think was 1661 but i don't don't
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
homie to that um
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
the okay and it is in the packet it was
 
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.189 align:start position:0%
the okay and it is in the packet it was
um

00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
there's set aside there's uh about a
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
million dollars for for quote-unquote
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
moving costs and i don't want people to
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
think that's putting people in a van
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
that involves a lot of the i.t
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and things
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
um and about uh three and a half i think
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's 3.75 million for um for
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
retrofitting the space
 
00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
retrofitting the space
the

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
the
biggest

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
cause of that is uh
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
need for additional offices
 
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.470 align:start position:0%
need for additional offices
the

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know many state agencies have very
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a very small number of offices
 
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
have a very small number of offices
but

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
doj sort of is disproportionately
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
officed if you will because they're
 
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.430 align:start position:0%
officed if you will because they're
lawyers

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman commissioner
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
nice to see you
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
the um two two uh quick questions i
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
believe one last my last visit to doj is
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh well they need a lot of office space
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
i i was crowded by boxes everywhere i
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
went with files and records
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping that's accounted and i'm
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
sure it is so you don't need the answer
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
my second is you'd made mention that if
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
we were to start from scratch and owned
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
our own land a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
square foot we couldn't do it for this
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
so to speak general number what it cost
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
for square foot this year now to put up
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
a building for the state we we had been
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
using as a rule of thumb something like
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
four hundred dollars a square foot um
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that's uh based on what's
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing with construction
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
costs right now i think that's probably
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
low and it's probably more like 500 now
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay um i mean if i were for example you
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
just put it this way if we went to the
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh capital budget with an item to build
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand square foot building
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
um we would we would probably ask them
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh at an initial estimate for 50.
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
