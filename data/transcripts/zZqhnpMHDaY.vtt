spot and when we're the live for your
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
die state but we can and should not make
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
it easy for adversaries to come into our
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
you'll hear testimony against this but
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
any amendments must be very tightly
 
00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
worded because remember if one Chinese
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
National owns property the CCP owns the
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
property and there's um a letter dated
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
February 2nd and I can afford it to um
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
it's to Meritt Garland and it's signed

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
closing I would say that we do have a
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
very vested interest and it's getting a
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
lot closer to home the states that have
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
um legalized marijuana have seen a
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
ballooning of these um illegal marijuana
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
facilities growing with that I'll take
 
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
facilities growing with that I'll take
any

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay d
 
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.549 align:start position:0%
questions okay d
represent

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
ton hi hi so before I ask my question I
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
want to establish that I am no supporter
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
of the red
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
Chinese however I am also a real estate
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
broker and I have to ask this question
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
in good
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
conscience with I understand all the
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
good reasons for wanting to pass this
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
bill I understand the threat to our way
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
of life keeping it really simple but
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're putting a restriction
 
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
on who I can sell my property to and who
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
can own property if this bill
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
passes and
 
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.430 align:start position:0%
passes and
so

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's my concern because today we
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
don't like the red Chinese fine what if
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
we don't like Jews tomorrow what if we
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
decide Catholics shouldn't be able
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
to own property and that is a real thing
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
that has happened in the history of this
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
country as you may well know Catholics
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't sit in this legislature until
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
the 20th century
 
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
so there's all kinds
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
of uh I'm concerned that this is a
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
slippery slope and I would hope that
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
there I I certainly hope that doesn't
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
happen but where's the protection that
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
we don't go down that road other than
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
our good judgment well first of all
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
Catholics and the Jews are protected um
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
under our constitution but if if you're
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
looking for authority to be able to sell
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
your land to the CCP that is close to a
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
military base then I would say no that's
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
stop China is one of our biggest
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
adversaries and they have been for a
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
long time and nothing's going to change
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
on that piece so I I I do say that if
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
you're willing to sell your land to a
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
Chinese organization that you know is
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to be run by the CCP and next to
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
one of our military bases or our
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
National Guard
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I say
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
no yeah but I let me just clear that
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
question up cuz I see this 10
 
00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:11.559 align:start position:0%
miles but then I'm looking at this list
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
and there's there's
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
where there isn't a restaurant a bank a
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
dam within 10 miles well so aren't you
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
really for all tens of purposes Banning
 
00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
any purchase of any land
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
by the Chinese government we're
 
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
restricting any purchase of land within
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
10 miles as I said of a National Guard
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
military installation and some
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure nothing's nothing is
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
there about restaurants well I I said
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay so food and agricultural
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
facilities including but not limited to
 
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.269 align:start position:0%
facilities including but not limited to
Farms

00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
Farms
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants and food manufacturing so
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
just but I'm just going through this
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
list now not withstanding that I happen
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
to the only legislator that owns a dam
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
so I did that kind of stook out out in
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
me okay and I'm saying 10 miles from me
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
well 10 miles that's to that's town
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
every town around is when 10 so for all
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
sens of purposes I mean Bridges I mean
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
tell me a town that doesn't have a
 
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
bridge okay it is true we have no
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
tunnels it is true we have no tunnels I
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's a tunnel in nature
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay right that is true okay so for all
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
sense of purposes you are Banning
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
any purchase of any land in the state of
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
of anywhere in New Hampshire because
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's no place that is going to meet
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
this 10 Mile re is correct okay great so
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
spear I can certainly understand the
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
National Guard and the uh military B
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's not really a military base it's a
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
listening satellite listening station up
 
00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:57.799 align:start position:0%
in uh I think it's in New Boston New
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
Boston is that where it is yeah yeah I
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
can understand you know that kind of
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
thing uh and I can even understand
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
preventing the sale of land right near
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
BAE Systems which is one of the most
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
secure facilities we have in the state
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
but we also have an agricultural
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
facility I don't know exactly where it
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
is because I don't know where anything
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
is uh that is the farmers have said have
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
come in in previous bills liked it they
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
says please whatever you do don't get
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
rid of that and the Chinese do own that
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
and it provides uh a very elaborate
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know collection of research
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
for the agricultural industry and it it
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
used to be owned by the Swiss I think
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
and now it's owned by the
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
Chinese but it's but the problem and and
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
I feel that we can't
 
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.470 align:start position:0%
I feel that we can't
really

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't know what to do with that
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
but what I guess my question is this
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
thank you are you EXP exp in if somebody
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
comes to me are you expecting me as an
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
individual or as a real estate person to
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
investigate these people's background
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
and figure out if they're Chinese and if
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
they don't I go to jail well you have to
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
on the transfers there's a form you have
 
00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
to sign now for the Feds that says it's
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
not a uh you have to say whether it's an
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
out of state out of yeah but I don't
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
know that anything that they said was
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
real no I know that but there is a for
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
there is a federally mandated form on
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
every real EST estate transaction that
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
where you as the seller and
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
affirmatively state that to the best of
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
your knowledge this is not
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
a uh external entity but the point is I
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
don't know the person tells me something
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
I believe them I don't know your defense
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
he's saying that your defense is that
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
you had that you signed that form is
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
that a good enough defense for this any
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
person who fails to comply with this
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
section not that that's a sort of a
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe okay
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
Herbert um does China allow us to buy
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
land in their uh absolutely
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.389 --> 00:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
am thank you senator for your taking our
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions um the bill I don't believe
 
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
addresses existing property that's owned
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
or potentially owned by an entity that
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
you know it there could be a long string
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
of shell companies that goes back to the
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
CCP um do do you intend uh to sever
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
ownership of land that could be
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
potentially traced back to the CCP
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
currently owned well I I this bill
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take effect until after after
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
that transaction so I would say no okay
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
but I think at the time if they decide
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
to sell it then that the new seller
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
could could not be a member of the CCP I
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
see thank
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
you and and this is only for sales not
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
for renting as far as I know yeah okay
 
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
so I again this was a this was a piece
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
of legislation that our attorney general
 
00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:14.950 align:start position:0%
of legislation that our attorney general
had

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
um they he he did an amicus brief on the
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation down in Florida so
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
he strongly they strongly support this
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
got it okay repres
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
representative burough yes sorry I keep
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
Wan calling you Anita sorry that's okay
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I think
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
one question that um some people may
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
have is what can we do to protect
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
Chinese who may be here from other
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
countries um even US citizens from
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination in uh when they want to
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
buy this type of property how can we
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
protect them um and and and the Realtors
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
um who may be selling to them and how do
 
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
we do that well the one thing that if
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
there US citizens whether regardless of
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
what their nationality is they're US
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
citizens they're eligible to purchase um
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
but understand that if they are Chinese
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
nationalists or um uh Chinese company in
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
2017 the Chinese passed legislation that
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
would require anyone who's a Chinese
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
National they don't own the property the
 
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.430 align:start position:0%
National they don't own the property the
CCP

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
CCP
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
does so we need to be very cognizant of
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that um if you're selling to a
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
Chinese nationalist you are virtually
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
selling to the
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
CCP because under Chinese law the
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
national the individual does not own
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
property nor does um the Chinese
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
company they are required to work under
 
00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
the CCP guidelines further question
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
mqu thanks I what I was actually getting
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
at is let's just hypothetically somebody
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
a Chinese uh person comes over from
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
London you know how do we protect them
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe you
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
know how do we protect them against
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination for having them
 
00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the CCP when they're not
 
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:15.389 align:start position:0%
associated with the CCP when they're not
if

00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're now I know there are certain
 
00:29:19.389 --> 00:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
individuals that come over like let's
 
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
say their their children are going to
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
school at Philips Academy and they they
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
either purchase or they rent property
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
that should not be an issue but if
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to be purchasing land
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
around any of those
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
facilities then it's going to be a
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
problem just like Maine's having the
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
problem with um Maine and what
 
00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.029 align:start position:0%
problem with um Maine and what
California

00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
California
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
729 Parcels of
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
land uh the CCP has
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
purchased um and they're growing illegal
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana but that doesn't I guess I I
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
still don't hear an answer to the
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
question which is a a citizen of Britain
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
comes over here and wants to buy
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
agricultural land say near New Boston
 
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:06.440 align:start position:0%
you know how number one how does the
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
realtor know that they're not you know
 
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
how do they investigate to find out that
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
they're not affiliated with the CCP or
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
that their rights are protected to be
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
able to have them buy land well if
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
they're a citizen of England then
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
they're not a member of the CCP okay
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's okay so I um can you just
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
read what you said before that if
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
somebody uh his student is at Philips
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
Andover and they're from the People's
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
Republic you said it wouldn't be a
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
problem for them to buy a house I would
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
think so well it's got to be 10 10 miles
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
restaurant so they no they
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
can't okay and has also been pointed out
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
is that uh lease is in here so that
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
means as someone like me who does
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
vacation rentals I've got to figure out
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
whether the person who's renting the
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes you just lost my vote okay did I
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
ever have it
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
representative probably not thought but
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
you just helped me kill it my own mind
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative thank you thank
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you senator for
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill and thanks for taking
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
my question um my question
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
is the United States has a number of
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
serious enemies of the state like
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
Russia should we also restrict transfer
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
of real property to those enemies of the
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
state like
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
Russia I would say not yet I mean there
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
are pieces of legislation out there that
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
ha have restricted um Iran
 
00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
Russia um
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
China um and I think there
 
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
was no there's one other one um they
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
have restricted we are just looking at
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the CCP because the CCP is really the
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
largest perpetrator in in our country on
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
purchasing land purchasing
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
businesses what follow up further
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
question may
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
inquire um when I read through some of
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
the details of the bill I I had not
 
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
noticed that it's quite Broad and it's a
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
full restriction because it does include
 
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.750 align:start position:0%
full restriction because it does include
like

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
Bridges and and
 
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
restaurants would you be open to
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
amending it so it's a little more narrow
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
and restricts um transfer of real
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
property to areas around our most
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
critical installations like the actual
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
military bases and not just every bridge
 
00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.110 align:start position:0%
military bases and not just every bridge
and

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
McDonald's I I would and I would also be
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
willing to look at um if you wanted to
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
amend it to Pro protect individuals who
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
want to um lease or purchase um for the
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
purposes of residential but I would be
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
very uh careful when you do when you do
 
00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:05.430 align:start position:0%
very uh careful when you do when you do
that

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
because I'm sorry ask the question again
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
so I diverted it's pretty it's pretty
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
Broad and while I while I think
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
the the principle of protecting our
 
00:33:19.549 --> 00:33:19.559 align:start position:0%
country's most valuable and our state's
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
most valuable assets especially our
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
military and our our special secrets and
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
things that so many people don't even
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
know about in New Boston and whatnot
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
that's and our critical infrastructure
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
is important sebr nuclear those thing
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
those things but restricting the the
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
open Commerce that's so important to our
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
state like renting an
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
Airbnb a mile from a McDonald's which is
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
really what this would restrict that
 
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
might be a little broad I'd be happy to
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
work on narrowing the scope of this
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislation if you'd be open to it I am
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
okay um I would be very cognizant too of
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that um we're we're talking
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
about a the agricultural business as
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
well and the Chinese have infiltrated
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that with their um um purchasing land
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
for seed po uh propagation and they're
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
um gaining more and more of our food
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
lines so I'd be very cognizant of that
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
as well thank you okay
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh good morning thank you for taking my
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
question do you know if other states
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
have enacted this legislation and how
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with researching you
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
know as uh representative Amon said you
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
know there could be several different
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
shell companies until you get to the
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
real owner so that just seems to be a a
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
complication of how to do that research
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
and what is the experience of other
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
states if they've passed something
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
similar thank you other states has have
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
as I stated in here
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
um Hawaii Iowa Minnesota Mississippi
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
North Dakota and Oklahoma they've
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
already banned it so what I can do is
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
try and contact some of the uh
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
representatives in that state and see
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
residents amm next and then represent
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
spe thank you again for taking our
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
questions and just to follow up on on
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
the previous question um has there been
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
any analysis
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
of currently owned property in the state
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
is there a way to figure out how big of
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
a problem this might be currently um
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
based on you know titles and deeds uh of
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
of existing property you mean in New
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New Hampshire is is there
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
if there isn't you know is there a way
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
to figure out how big of an issue that
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
this is currently I can talk to um
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general Chris Assistant
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
Attorney General Chris Bond who helped
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
me write the legislation and see what he
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
know what he can find out it' be yeah
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
it'd be good just to get a handle on how
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
big of a problem it is currently thank
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
spear this this may be a would you
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
believe I I retired from BAE Systems in
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
2020 prior to
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
20120 and at the time of my leaving we
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
had personnel there with that were
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
Chinese Nationals holding green cards
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
and BAE Systems has some of the highest
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
secrets in the country they had no
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
problem they did their a security
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
investigations and did whatever they do
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
and they had no problem hiring these
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
people and these people bought homes
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
on what we're expecting here especially
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
in light of even ba systems didn't have
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
a problem would you believe would you
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
believe I would believe that because I
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
also worked at rathon over the past few
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
years though it's been becoming a um uh
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
problem in the security aspect of it now
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
Bae may very well be doing their their
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
due diligence in the background check
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
but as as we said I will look um look
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
through the other states that have
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
passed it try and talk to some of their
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
representatives and find out how they
 
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:19.510 align:start position:0%
protect if anyone's coming in to
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
protect if anyone's coming in to
[Music]

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
um purchase land or purchase a um house
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
so that they can see their kids graduate
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
I will look into that and see how they
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
protect them or rent it a vacation
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
rental okay vacation
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
rentals okay I wouldn't want my my my
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
son-in-law owns one so I wouldn't want
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
either represent rner thank you thanks
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I guess I'm
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about enforcement because the
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill does not actually require a seller
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
or anybody who's renting property to do
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
any due diligence about the buyer or the
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
renter and there's no reference in there
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
to any government
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
agency doing research into these
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
purchases so how how would it be
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
enforced and that's a question I'll ask
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
Chris spon because I mean obviously he
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
had it when he they did the Amicus brief
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
in Florida they obviously had a process
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
that he was thinking of when they put
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
that Amicus brief together
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
testimony you're welcome I have one card
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
here uh Robert Johnson from the Farm
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
bill good morning good morning thank you
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and members of the committee
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Rob Johnson
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
and I appeared before you representing
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Farm Bureau is a
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
federation's policy director and we do
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
oppose the the bill as drafted we
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
certainly share the concerns and support
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
the intent of the sponsor no doubt but
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
as you've pointed out the bill is
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
written is very absolute and it's broad
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's there's no ability for somebody
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
to plead their case as to why they don't
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
fall under this category and as as has
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
been pointed out in the bill language
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
itself it it does include in lines eight
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
and nine you know leasing possessing or
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
exercising control in addition to
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
ownership and it is as been pointed out
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's you know this critical
 
00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure as defined is very broad
 
00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh you look on uh page page two line 18
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
where it says the word Farms well my my
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
Forest land is part of my farm I know
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
many people think it's just a crop land
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
but my Forest land is part of my farm
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is 84% forested yeah there
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
was Federal lands that are forested but
 
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
still in state lands as well but still
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's a again it's just very a very
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
broad we would as as the committee did
 
00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
with you the previous bill that I
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
testified before you early this year
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1183 you're holding it for
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
study we'd encourage you to do the same
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
with this take a look at the the the law
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
that recently passed in North Dakota
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
where there the military installation
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
and there this became a public concern
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
there's some language in that statute
 
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
that enables the leasing of land for
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
agricultural research purposes which is
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
something I mentioned to you before that
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
we would not want that our our State
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
University should have to pass up an
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to bring in some some
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
dollars research dollars to to to uh you
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
know study a local agricultural uh
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
concern another area you may want to you
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
should be aware of is that there there
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
are a Chinese entities that lease
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
storage facilities in the state for
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
we're thinking the purpose of high value
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
logs where they will purchase these high
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
value logs store them until they can
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
ship them back back home over over seas
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
that that's very lucrative for for land
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
owners the these these logs it it it's
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
something that again that that you
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
should be aware of and look into how
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
that may be accommodated um and and I
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
guess just in closing I I also mention
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
that the the first state to pass a
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
statute similar to this was in Arkansas
 
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
and this past fall there's a a seed
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
company in Arkansas that it's a it's a
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
started in Minnesota and then and back
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
around the 1895 something like that and
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
eventually it be it's now a wholly own
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
Subs subsidiary of senta which is a a
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
senta is a it's a basically a Swiss
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
company that is is is headquartered in
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
Switzerland that was purchased by chem
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
chinina in
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
2016 something like that anyway because
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
this of that that line for the seed
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
company they are now they be they have
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
two years to sell the 60 Acres of of
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
research land that they own that company
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
is my understanding is there are all uh
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
American workers most of them live in
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
the local community they were the uh if
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
not the largest one of the largest
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
contributors to the FFA in the state of
 
00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
Arkansas and it again it's just not it's
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
not clear cut and dried as to you know
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
the the Chinese control in some
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
situations and that's why we believe it
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
though we do support again support the
 
00:42:26.839 --> 00:42:27.670 align:start position:0%
though we do support again support the
int

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
int
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
that that you do need to look into some
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
of these other uh areas that we almost
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's where it it just doesn't make sense
 
00:42:37.309 --> 00:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
for us as a as a country uh you know to
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
to be to be restricting this that
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
broadly and and again though again we do
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
support the the intent I'll leave it at
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your time and
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
attention thank you very
 
00:42:53.069 --> 00:42:53.079 align:start position:0%
much okay I think we're all set having
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
no more cards it will close the public
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
hearing on 366 and go right into our
 
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.829 align:start position:0%
hearing on 366 and go right into our
next

00:43:02.829 --> 00:43:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.839 --> 00:43:07.870 align:start position:0%
 
Bild

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
right um Taran did did you feel out of C
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm just
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
not okay we will open up the public
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 423 and hear from
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor Senator Carson good
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
morning Senator Carson good morning Mr
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and good morning members of the
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
House Commerce Committee for the record
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Sharon Carson and I have the
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
pleasure of representing Senate District
 
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
14 comprising the towns of Auburn London
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
Dair in Hudson and this morning for your
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
consideration I have Senate Bill 423
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
relative to mandatory disclosure of
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
insurance policy limits as you can
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
probably tell there are a lot of uh
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
people in the insurance company that are
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
behind us so um I think you're going to
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
have an an interesting day already um
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
every day is exciting with this well I I
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
looked at your docket and and you you've
 
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
got everything from the the land issue
 
00:44:26.109 --> 00:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
now this IVF you're just getting a
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
little bit of everything so I I imagine
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
that keeps things interesting Mr
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
chairman um Mr chairman this bill um is
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
about the disclosure of insurance limits
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
um it has
 
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
significantly CH it has changed um from
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate when we had the Senate
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
hearing I listened very carefully to the
 
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
issues concerning the insurance
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
companies um it originally would have
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
applied to all businesses and and every
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
kind of situation
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
but uh again we heard a lot of
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
complaints about that so it it changed
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
in two ways number one it is
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
significantly narrowed to only deal with
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle accidents and there was
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
some concerns that were V uh voiced
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
about protecting um an insurer's policy
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and their privacy and language
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
was put in there that does that but what
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
does this what does this bill really do
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if people are aware of
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that if you get into an
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
automobile accident that in order to get
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
information about the other person's
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
policy you actually have to get an
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
attorney and
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
Sue that seems to be pretty
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
outrageous why should you have to do
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
that and what this bill does is it makes
 
00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
it easier for an individual to get that
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
information and request it
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's a saying Mr chairman that
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
power and there's a concern on the
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
behalf of the insurance industry that if
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
you as someone who's been injured find
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
out about the other person's policy
 
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
limits that you're going to go you're
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
going to go for the whole
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
thing nothing can be further from the
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
truth I think those of you that have
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
been on Commerce for a while know that
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's a number of factors that are in
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
play when someone does make an Insurance
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
claim against somebody and um I will
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
talk about those in a few minutes
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to a failure to
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
divulge the policy limits um what could
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
happen is you could have a judgment
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's in excess of that policy limit
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the chances that an
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
individual takes or a company takes when
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
they do not give you that
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
information um
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
as the argument goes revealing liability
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
limits could have avoided this liability
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the applicable limits of the
 
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.069 align:start position:0%
beyond the applicable limits of the
available

00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
Insurance in many states an insurer's
 
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
failure failure to reveal policy limits
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
at the pre-litigation stage can serve as
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
a basis for a thirdparty bad faith claim
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore because of a failure to
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
disclose policy limits could be
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
instrumental in resolving a conflict of
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
Interest favoring the insurance
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
company's economic interests over those
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
of its policyholders and insurer a
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
liability carer that refuses to Li
 
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
reveal their limits again could be
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
exposing themselves to a bad faith claim
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not to reveal and insurers
 
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
liability policy limits is a sensitive
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
issue because it lays bare a point
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
within the claims process where the
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
interest of the insurer
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
which favors the insurer not to reveal
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
policy limits diverge those of the
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
insured and this is a revelation um
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
which AIDS the settlement and may
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
prevent actual
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
litigation a demand for policy limits is
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
routinely alleged to be necessary in
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
order to properly evaluate and settle a
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
case that I think is extremely important
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
most people will settle they'll work
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll work with the others
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
insurance company they might hire an
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
attorney but they they're going to aim
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
for settlement you will see people that
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
will sue for large amounts of money and
 
00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
it depends upon the type of damage
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's happened to you as an individual
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
you might have sustained serious um uh
 
00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
physical injury very expensive medical
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
claims ongoing treatment all of those
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
things are considered but if you have to
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
fire hire an attorney to even begin the
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
process I I I just personally I don't
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
think that that's appropriate I think
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
you should be able to get that
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
information um if a settlement demand is
 
00:49:14.789 --> 00:49:14.799 align:start position:0%
within policy limits the demand is
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
rejected and the insure the injured
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me the insured experiences a
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
judgment in excess of policy limits for
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
which the insurance company refused to
 
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
identify and quite frankly a bad faith
 
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
claim is going to follow this bill is
 
00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:34.359 align:start position:0%
necessary because of all 50 states New
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is only one of four that does
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
not have a bad faith cause of action
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
that might be triggered by an insurance
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
company not disclosing policy limits to
 
00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.349 align:start position:0%
company not disclosing policy limits to
a

00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
plaintiff New Hampshire is the only New
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
England state that does not require pres
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
disclosure of policy limits
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
the language that was amended in this
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
bill comes from uh one of our
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and we know that in
 
00:50:07.549 --> 00:50:07.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the vast majority of civil
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
cases will settle
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
pre-trial this saves time and money for
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
all parties involved without having to
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
go through costly
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
litigation there may be a concern that
 
00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
if an injured person knows the policy
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
limits um that uh will become the amount
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
to be claimed in the case I've already
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned that but that is quite frankly
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
unfounded a person's damages in a case
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
are determined by many factors such as
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
medical bills lost wages pain and
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
suffering the assessment of Damages will
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
need to be supported by evidence you
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
have to have evidence you have to have
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
proof of the injuries you have to have
 
00:50:53.069 --> 00:50:53.079 align:start position:0%
proof of the medical
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
bills the assessment of Damages will
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
need to be again supported by evidence
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
simply knowing what the policy limits
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
are in a case does not change those
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
calculations this bill simply ensures
 
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
that a person injured by a person with
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage available to them
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
knows how much insurance coverage is
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
available to cover the claim Senate Bill
 
00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
423 does not impact the cost of Damages
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
it merely informs the injured person
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
whether the person who caused their
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
injury has enough insurance this bill
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
makes disclosure mandatory without
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
having to file a lawsuit and will
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
encourage judicial economy um Mr
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
chairman at this point I think I'm going
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
to uh conclude my testimony um and I
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
will be happy to try to answer any
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
 
00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.950 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
represent

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
MC thank you Mr chairman the the last
 
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
time I remember dealing with this was
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
when thank you senator for taking my
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
question for bringing the bill back um I
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
think the last time we dealt with it was
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
when your husband was my vice chair on
 
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
this committee so 20 some years ago and
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh we had a a learned colleague um
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative defia who was super
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on this issue and we
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
studied it and for whatever reason it
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
didn't go forward but 20 years has
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
passed and I in since then about 19
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
states have enacted it so in the 31
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
states that haven't um what I'm
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
wondering is do the is the practice for
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies will they just
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
tell you if it's a low limit because
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
it'll make you go away and they'll
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
settle for nuisance money so the
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
implication being that if it's a high
 
00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.630 align:start position:0%
implication being that if it's a high
limit

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:52:42.789 --> 00:52:42.799 align:start position:0%
um you know they may not want to
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
disclose it and so you can infer the
 
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
opposite is is true and right they so if
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
they if they are Deep Pockets they may
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
be less likely to disclose and if it's
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
510 or 1020
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
that does that make sense okay I I thank
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question I think I
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
understand it I think it's important to
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
realize what really happens is you have
 
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
to hire an attorney first in order to
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
get that what the policy limit is so
 
00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
this says you don't have to hire the
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
attorney if you make the request they
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
have to tell you that's what this bill
 
00:53:23.309 --> 00:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
does if you find out early without
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
having to file an file a case in court
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
in order order to get them to divulge
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
you could work towards a settlement
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
earlier not involve attorneys you figure
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
it out if you want to hire an attorney
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
fine but I find it egregious that you
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
have to hire an attorney in order to
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
find out what the limit is and there's a
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
formula as to how your CH uh what you've
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
gone through your pain your suffering
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
you've got bills you just can't pull a
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
number out of the air you're going to
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
find out what the policy limit is anyway
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day but why should you
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
the injured party have to hire an
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
attorney in order to find out what that
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
policy limit is why do you have to file
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
on attorne that's the issue you're going
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
to find out but in order to find out you
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
have to hire an attorney you have to sue
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
to get that why should you get that why
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
should you do have to go through that I
 
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
think the the issue he was pointing out
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
was that if you request and they tell
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know without without having go to
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and they tell you well the
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
limits are only 50,000 you know does
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
they have a minimum policy
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
5025 but that if they don't tell
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
you that should tell you something right
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
there that if they don't tell you that
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
means they're probably like me and have
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
an umbrella and frankly I'm not sure I
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
really want you to know that I have an
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
umbrella but you'll figure it out real
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
quick when you see the lawyer that I
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
show up
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
with is my insurance company's lawyer
 
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
I Mr chairman I understand that but I
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that the average person
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
should have to hire an attorney got it
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that is I I think that's just
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
egregious you're going to find out in
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
the end anyway the only problem I have
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
with your point is the whole reason this
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill is in front of you is because there
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
has to be a law the end of the day there
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
is absolutely a a I identify what kind
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
of lawyer but it's a lawyer you've hired
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
to help you win this case to get
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
compensation you have already hired a
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
lawyer you already have that lawyer now
 
00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839 align:start position:0%
if that lawyer says well I'm going to
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
charge you 250 bucks to file this claim
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's just part of the legal bill that
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
that lawyer is probably going to say is
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'll get half of it once we get our
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
settlement so I'm I your your whole
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
issue is saying we have to hire H I'm
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
just saying is I doubt there's anybody
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
that is ever in this situation that
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to hire a lawyer at all and
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
now only has to hire a lawyer just to
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
find out the ends that the reality is in
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
any of these cases there's always you
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
always have to hire a lawyer well thank
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
you for that but I I think it's kind of
 
00:56:15.029 --> 00:56:15.039 align:start position:0%
hard to come to that conclusion Mr
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman because you have to F you have
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
to hire a lawyer to begin with you have
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
to hire the lawyer to find out what
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
about the insurance policy you have to
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer no matter what
 
00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
and so if it is that low number you you
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
give people the opportunity to settle
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
right no say number they'll tell you
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
they'll be more than willing to
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
generously tell you that number it's
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
only when it's not a high it's a high
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
number that's when they're little being
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
a little koi and not so excited about
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
telling you and about it Mr chair the
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
testimony we had is they don't divulge
 
00:56:56.029 --> 00:56:56.039 align:start position:0%
anything they do not voluntarily give
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
you you a limit that is the testimony we
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
had in the Senate so I just had a uh
 
00:57:05.069 --> 00:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
someone uh call me and told me
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
differently said that often they are
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
told are they on the record Mr chairman
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
uh I I I don't see their cart that is
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
true they haven't filed a cart in here
 
00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
but they called me and told me in known
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
certain terms that they're that if the
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
number's low enough that absolutely the
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
appraiser probably tells them you know
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
the adjuster we'll tell them what the
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
limits are okay representative Ammon has
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
a question sure thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking a question and
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
you actually touched on the gist of my
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
question if if someone has a a
 
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:41.799 align:start position:0%
homeowners policy or an umbrella policy
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
um is that included are they included in
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
this definition of insur uh for this
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
bill this only deals with automobile
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
insurance so it would just it's just
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance um when the bill
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
was originally filed it would have
 
00:57:59.950 --> 00:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
included everything but we heard from
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that they were very very
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about this and so we said okay
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
what what is the most contact that you
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
would ever have and it usually is some
 
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
sort of automobile accident um your
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
car's been uh I don't want to say
 
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
injured but it's you've sustained some
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
sort of damage to your vehicle or you
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
have been injured in some way that's
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
what most people experience so we we
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
just focused on automobile insurance and
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
we also heard from the
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
insurers um and the changes that we made
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
are reflected in this bill and it's
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that um they they're just
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
not interested in any kind of a
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
compromise and you can tell when they
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
come forward to testify and that's very
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
disappointing it truly is I just have a
 
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
um how how is the insurance company of
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
the other party how is it disclosed uh
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
you know I guess it could be in a police
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
report but is it is it mandatory for the
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
the other party that you're potentially
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
trying to get damages from to tell you
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
who their insurance company is and in
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
what what circumstances does that happen
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's no law saying that they have to
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
tell you um we do not have mandatory car
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
insurance in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have an insurance card that we
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
have to carry somewhere in the vehicle
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
so if you get into some sort of
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
automobile accident you present your
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
card to show that you have proof of
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
insurance right there is the information
 
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
but we don't do that here in New
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if the other party
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily gives you that information
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
that's great you've got a place to start
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
but there's no requirement that they
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
disclose information to you at
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
all uh except if you drive out of state
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
you better have one right well that's Mr
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
chairman we can only make laws for the
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we can't we can't
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
make every every surrounding State as
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
great as we are right represent for
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question and this is relative
 
01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:12.039 align:start position:0%
to the Chairman's point about that
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to hire a law
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
lawyer anyway isn't it true that there
 
01:00:19.029 --> 01:00:19.039 align:start position:0%
are a significant number of people who
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're not going to hire a lawyer
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
because a lawyer is going to ask for a
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
retainer up front and they're going to
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
say it's $250 an hour minimum and
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee that you're going
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
to win the case and that they're going
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
to you know unless they take it on a
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
contingency so there a lot of people
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
can't come up with that is that not true
 
01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:38.359 align:start position:0%
yes that is true thank
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
you represent M again to to the point I
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
think someone just me mentioned what
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
happens and actually happened to me um
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
what happens if both parties are from
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in in the case for for
 
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
me the accident happened on Paka
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
Boulevard One Night in LOL Massachusetts
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
both insured myself and the other guy
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
that hit me head on uh were from New
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and as the case may be when I
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
asked the question by the way the first
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
visitor to the hospital the next morning
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
was one of those lawyers you mentioned
 
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
that I didn't hire and true true story I
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
didn't hire um what happens then and I
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
asked the question what because he asked
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
the question find out what your policy
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
limits s and call me back uh and I asked
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
the question and they told me uh and
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
then days later they reluctantly said
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
well there's something that we haven't
 
01:01:39.789 --> 01:01:39.799 align:start position:0%
told you and that's you're both insured
 
01:01:39.799 --> 01:01:41.190 align:start position:0%
told you and that's you're both insured
by

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
metti which was so we are there's no
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
subreg we're negotiating against
 
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves and they did eventually
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
disclose the the policy
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
limit uh which was crazily the same for
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
both parties so what happens then do
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
happened in Massachusetts both policies
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
were New Hampshire residents he was from
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
Nashville I was from marac thank you for
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
the question I am not an expert in
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
insurance and I am not an expert in the
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
laws of
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um we know that each state
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
does things differently so I really
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question um but there
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
are folks here that I think if you were
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
to pose that question that could
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
probably answer that question and I
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to give the committee
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
misleading or bad
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
information it it was an oddball and uh
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay uh we'll call
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
on the thank you very much oh thank you
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh call on the insurance
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
department it Senator Carson do you have
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
written testimony that you can put in
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
some notes okay no problem thank you
 
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
yeah uh good morning my name is uh James
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
Fox I'm the uh property and casualy
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
director at the New Hampshire insurance
 
01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
department and I'm joined here uh by
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
Emily dhy who's the property casualty uh
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
attorney at the
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
department um the department uh opposes
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
the bill on uh two grounds first grounds
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
we feel it's unnecessary based on the
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
current state of Law and we also feel it
 
01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:30.279 align:start position:0%
is a financial privacy invasion of
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
policy holders I mean the law talks
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
about claimants and it talks about
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but the other entity
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
involved is the policy holder as to why
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary um there's really two
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
two phases there's like a front-end
 
01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:45.799 align:start position:0%
phase and then the back end phase on the
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
front end auto insurance uh as those
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
you've been here a while know is is
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
unique in New Hampshire it's not like
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
figuratively unique or kind of it is
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
unique we have a unique system here and
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
our system is designed so that when you
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
buy an in an auto insurance policy you
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
are able to protect yourself so you
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
choose your limits for liability so if
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
you go out and you hit someone in low
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts those would be your
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
liability limits of the person you hit
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
uh but uh what you get with that in New
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since we don't have mandatory
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
Insurance uh is that you get an equal
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
amount of uninsured motorist coverage so
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
if you're concerned about uh that you
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
might get into an accident you might be
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
injured your first line of defense is to
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
have uh a high liability limit which
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
would then give you a high uninsured
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
motorist coverage so if the person you
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
hit if they have a
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
2550 uh small policy but you have say a
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
single limit 500,000 then you're going
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
to have 500,000 fear injuries uh and
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
then lay it on top of that you then
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
could get uh uh as
 
01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
a chairman hunt said a uh an umbrella
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
policy uh but that's the first line um
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
that that's really how the our whole
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
state systems been designed uh over the
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
years is that since we don't have
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh auto insurance the design
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
is that you are able to protect yourself
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
but I understand that not everybody can
 
01:05:01.269 --> 01:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
afford a high 500 you know a high policy
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
with with an umbrella so then we have
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
another layer uh of protection uh that
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
we have at the department and that's
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
called 417 415 it's called unfair claims
 
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
practices so that is how we uh handle
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
the issue of how the insurance company
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh interacts with the uh
 
01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:20.109 align:start position:0%
uh interacts with the uh
claimants

01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
claimants
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the first line is they have to
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
before they settle we require them to do
 
01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
a reasonable investigation and so just
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
keep that on a simple level I think
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned a police report before
 
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh if an if an insurance company tried
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
to settle early and settle low if
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
there's a significant injury and they
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
say they didn't get a a a police report
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
then eventually we do what's called an
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
examination and then every time they've
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
done that they get fined on that every
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
time $2,500 $2,500 $2,500 and then they
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
have to get an action plan to make sure
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
they don't do that again and then the
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
next line uh and the next section uh
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's three section four is they have
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
to equitably be settled they have to
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
settle fairly so if they're not settling
 
01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
fairly with you again that's another
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
violation of the unfair insurance claims
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
Practices Act and it is true that
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
generally how from the Department's uh
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
perspective how this generally does work
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
is if you have a low limits e it could
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
be one of two things you either have a
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
low limits policy and then just going to
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
tell you it's a 2550 um will you know
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
they're willing to settle with you if
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
you're willing to you know sign a a a
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
settlement a release uh or you could
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
have a serious situation like uh uh
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
somebody died and then even if it's a
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
higher policy they they say look this is
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
what we have um we are willing to settle
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
for that amount uh but again if it is a
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
if it is a high amount then they tend
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
not to do that um and the department uh
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
understands that so as they said earlier
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
in auto insurance you're able to protect
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
yourself and then I always say you
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
should protect yourself and you know is
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
have the highest limits you can have
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
because that you know if you actually
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
get if you see get seriously hurt if you
 
01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
end up in a wheelchair you're going to
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to have high limits um but uh if
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass there is a
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
concern uh that now saying that you
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
would you know the people the the
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill may be uh great
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
people and not not doing that but there
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
might be some other attorneys out there
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
who may use it uh as as a leverage to
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
say oh you know we're going to work this
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
more to get the get the number up and
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
and that's a concern so then we'd have
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
to change our you know get as much
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
insurance as you can to protect yourself
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
to you know there is a possibility you
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
you will have to disclose your limit so
 
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
you may have to consider that also also
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and then uh and before I forget so
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
this I'm talking about 4174 so there's
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
also uh one other provision that says um
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to offer you a
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
settlement substantially lower than the
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
value of what your claim is that that
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
was added not too long ago uh but the
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
other the other issue is I think someone
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned this this is currently in the
 
01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
the new version which is you must uh you
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
must disclosed limits is currently uh
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
seated in the department of safety's um
 
01:07:57.230 --> 01:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
law that would not be if you wanted to
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
go down that road that would not be the
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
right location for it it would be 4174
 
01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:01.839 align:start position:0%
because what you basically done is put
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
something in the department of safey law
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
that is an insurance conduct issue which
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
they don't really handle they they do
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility which is how
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
much you have but they don't do conduct
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
and you also gave the department of
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
safety um the ability to find the
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um for that conduct
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
issue so that that that's always been um
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
with the uh insurance
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
department um and also would add and
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
know there was something that somebody
 
01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
said that you needed to have an attorney
 
01:08:28.990 --> 01:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh to to get your limits that that is
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
not true there's there's that's not in
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
the law anywhere so basically uh if you
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
ask uh and it's a it's it's a low
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
whether you have a your the limits are
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
low you should get the answer uh and uh
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
you know as I always said we're going
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
through all of these issues and there
 
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
are laws we have a group of people at
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
the insurance department called the
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
consumer Division and so if anybody here
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
has a has a problem with an insurance
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
company they don't feel like they're
 
01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
being handled the the claims being
 
01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
handled correctly you can call the
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
insurance department and we will help
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
you work through the claim uh and if we
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
feel that the uh insurance company has
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh violated uh the unfair claims
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
Practices Act again on an individual
 
01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:11.080 align:start position:0%
basis on a one claim consumer claim so
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
not want doing exams we'll also find
 
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
them in that context so all of this is
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
designed to make sure that the insurance
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
company um does what they're supposed to
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
do uh we don't feel that there's going
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be any added protection uh if if you
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
have a disclosure limits what you're
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
going to have if you say is a mandatory
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure limits is you're going to
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
have you're going to run a file of ins
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
3000 ins 3000 is one of our rules and
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
the rule basically protects the
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
financial information of policy holders
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
so obviously insurance companies are to
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
a certain extent a lot of States they're
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
regulated by the same entity like Banks
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh and so just like Banks and insurance
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
companies we do not want them giving out
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
the private uh financial information of
 
01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh residents of the State of New
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so in that they usually how it
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
works is they have to give they explain
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
how they're going to use your
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
information but if you want to opt out
 
01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to opt out and say don't
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
don't give my information out to anybody
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh and so they they really currently if
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
you ask them to do that they should not
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
be giving out your limits because you've
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
asked them not to um and then the last
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
thing some somebody mentioned uh uh that
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
this is from another state I believe
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's Maine and again we said how unique
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is uh in Auto World Maine
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
is not like that main is a completely
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
different regulatory structure so if you
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
you wanted to do that you probably would
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
need to bring the whole main regulatory
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
structure over you shouldn't do it like
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
peace meal because we have a system in
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the department feels it
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
works very well and it protects the
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
residence of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
and we would like it to remain as is and
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
great representative burrow thanks for
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure I understood you correctly are you
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
saying that if somebody wants to know
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
the limit they can get it as long as the
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
other party hasn't opted out a financial
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
disclosure or did I misunderstand that
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
what I was saying is somebody said you
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
have to have an attorney uh you don't
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
have to have an attorney to that's not a
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
standard to get to get the limits if as
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
it's been expressed here it's accurate
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
if if the party has a very low limit and
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
you have a serious claim the insurance
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
company wants to wants to end it too if
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to take the the low
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
limit and not go any further and maybe
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have you have your own uninsured
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
motorist they're going to tell you that
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the limit of the the tort feaser in
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
this case is only 2550
 
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
um we'll just give you the limits and
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
then you go to your insurance company
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
when you have a much higher policy then
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
you say h i they offer you the 20 the
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
2550 I'd like to take that and I'd like
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
to make an uninsured Motors claim and
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
then they say okay then you go down the
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
road and your uninsured Motors claim and
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
that's why uh if you have if you're able
 
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
you should have a high limit on your
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
uninsured Motors claim uninsured Motors
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
limits on your policy so just all I'm
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
saying is that the the way the world
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
works is that if you have if it's a
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
somebody has a low limit and the
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
insurance think company thinks they can
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
get out they will tell you those limits
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
if some somebody has a very high limit
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
then there are a lot other other
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
variables that come into play and the
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company is not as willing to
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
to to tell you those the limits because
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're they are afraid right or wrong
 
01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
Target any other questions thank you
 
01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
sorry for the record Israel Piedra um
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney in Nashua at welz White
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
and Fontaine a law firm I live in
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester I was a member of the house
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
for two
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
terms um I'm here to testify in favor of
 
01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.110 align:start position:0%
terms um I'm here to testify in favor of
this

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
bill the first thing I'll say is that it
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
really is a small bill in my mind it's
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
not world changing it's a technical fix
 
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
it makes a small but meaningful Common
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
Sense change and it will improve access
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
to justice for folks in New Hampshire in
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
again a small but meaningful way so
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing I want to frame
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're not changing the world here but I
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
do think it's a step in the right
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
direction and I'll explain why so why do
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
we need this so the typical example is
 
01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
someone comes into my office they're a
 
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
client they were injured in a car
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
accident as an attorney we make a
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
valuation an evaluation about what that
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
claim might be worth and so I might
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
advise the client I don't think that you
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
should settle for less than
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
$60,000 you were out of work for a month
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
you incurred tens of thousands of
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
dollars in medical
 
01:13:54.629 --> 01:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
bills I think that your claim is worth
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
$60 ,000 so we present that information
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
to the other driver who was at fault
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
their insurance company and they make an
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
offer of
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
$50,000 now under current New Hampshire
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
law which we're trying to change the
 
01:14:09.239 --> 01:14:11.270 align:start position:0%
law which we're trying to change the
insurance

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
adjuster may know that the insured
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
policy limits is $50,000 and that's the
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
maximum they can offer but they don't
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
have to tell me that and in fact as you
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
just heard from the insurance
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
department apparently under current law
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
there not allowed to tell you that um
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
and so there is in fact in practice
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
some differences of of of of how that
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
works in practice some insurance
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
adjusters will give you that information
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
voluntarily but under current law as we
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
just heard from the insurance department
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
they're actually not supposed to and in
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
fact sometimes they don't so now you're
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
in a situation where your client has
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
been offered $50,000 Which is less than
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
what you've told them that their claim
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
is worth and as an attorney you
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
ethically cannot recommend that they
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
take that settlement for $50,000 unless
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know for a fact that's all the money
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's available so now what happens is
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
you have to draft a lawsuit on their
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
behalf that'll take a few weeks you
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
filed the lawsuit with the court pay
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
$300 odd dollar $280 in filing fees to
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
the court you give it to the sheriff pay
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
the sheriff to serve it on the defendant
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
some person in their house gets served
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
by the sheriff even though they're
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
insured then you go into court the
 
01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
insurance company has to hire a
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
lawyer they file an answer and then a
 
01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
month later under current New Hampshire
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
statute and Court rule they are then
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
required to tell us hey the insurance
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
policy limit is only $50,000 that's all
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
you can get and then you settle the case
 
01:15:49.790 --> 01:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
for $50,000 because that's all you can
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
get you could have avoided that drafting
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit waiting weeks serving with
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
the sheriff having to interrupt some po
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
person at their home even though they
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
have insurance weeks waiting in the
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
court system bured on the court
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
insurance company having to hire a
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
lawyer all to reach the same result
 
01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
because under current statute which is
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
498 colon
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
2-a once suit is filed the insurance
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
company is required to disclose their
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
policy limits we're just asking that we
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
go back a few weeks or months to the the
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
moment where we're trying to settle the
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
case without having to go through all
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
that trouble and require them to
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
disclose it then that's all we're asking
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
for and it really doesn't make much of a
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
difference to lawyers we get paid the
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
same no matter whether we settle two
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
months ago or two months in the in the
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
future it makes a difference to our
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
clients because a they have to pay for
 
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:47.480 align:start position:0%
those court costs which are not a lot
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
but it's a few hundred dollar to to to
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit and to pay a sheriff to
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
serve the lawsuit and it makes more of a
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
difference because of the time the time
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
to draft the lawsuit to have it served
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
to wait for the insurance company to
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer and respond and then
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
finally disclose that information we
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
should have had a couple months ago and
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
these people often are living paycheck
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
to paycheck they haven't worked for a
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
long time they have medical bills that
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
might be going to collections and they
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
need the money and all this bill would
 
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
do um would be to help them get that
 
01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:21.320 align:start position:0%
money which they're going to get anyway
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit sooner um so I really think
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's a common sense fix it's a
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
relatively minor fix that just speeds up
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
the process by a few few weeks or months
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
and helps get money into injured
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
people's hands that they're going to get
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
anyway a little bit quicker I'm happy to
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
burs thank you I just have a quick
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
question thanks for taking my question
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
the example you gave where the insurance
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
company had a $50,000 limit what if
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
somebody has an accident and they have
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
$3 million worth of medical bills do
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
they I mean can they not they cannot get
 
01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:01.719 align:start position:0%
more than 50,000 well and I I won't go
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
into a lot of detail about underinsured
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
motorist coverage which the
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative from the insurance
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
department talked about if there's no if
 
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
the person who is injured if I'm
 
01:18:14.629 --> 01:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
uninsured and I'm hit by someone else
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
and they only have $50,000 in coverage
 
01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
in most cases yes now that's an extreme
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
example with $3 million a catastrophic
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
type injury and those situations Al laer
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
will still do their due diligence to to
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's no other assets
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
that the defendant has if they own
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
multiple houses for example or they're
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
somehow rich in some other way there's
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
no uh there's no rule that you can't go
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
past that insurance C coverage limit and
 
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
pursue them personally but what happens
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
in practice is if someone only has
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
$50,000 of coverage they probably don't
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
have multiple houses they probably don't
 
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
have a bank account with a million
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
dollars in it and they have protection
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
under certain laws including bankruptcy
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
laws that make it really unfeasible to
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
get more than that $50,000 limit in
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
almost every situation thank you and
 
01:19:04.199 --> 01:19:06.470 align:start position:0%
almost every situation thank you and
that's

01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
horrifying represent M uh thank you um
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
just a quick question you you mentioned
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
uninsured how about underinsured and in
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
this case if I had a million dollars
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
worth of my own liability coverage and
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
he only had uh 50 could we dip into that
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
a absolutely and so again the way that
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
underinsured coverage works is typically
 
01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
that it only kicks in the ins again the
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
insurance department uh representative I
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
think mated things it's not the first
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
line of defense legally it's the second
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
line of defense you're required to
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
exhaust the tort fees or defendants
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage before you get to dip
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
into your own coverage it's a backup um
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
and so what would happen in that
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
situation is again you still need to
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
have that insurance coverage limit
 
01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:55.550 align:start position:0%
have that insurance coverage limit
information

01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
um in order to settle with the Tor fees
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
or the defendant first before you get to
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
dip into your own coverage um so this
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill would help in that situation too
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
where right now you might have to
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
actually bring a lawsuit waste your time
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%

Bill

01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
423 um I just wanted to clear one thing
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
up I don't think currently there's an
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
issue in practice and we I think it's
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
Undisputed and there's correspondence
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
from the bill proponents and testimony
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
and also from industry that the majority
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the time if there's a legitimate
 
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
request pre- lawsuit for a policy limit
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure that information is
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
voluntarily provided
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
already now are there times when perhaps
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
the information isn't provided yes but
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
there's good reason for that and we
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
mandating policy information no
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
questions asked is a good policy
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
decision so we'd ask you not to vote for
 
01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.470 align:start position:0%
decision so we'd ask you not to vote for
the

01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
bill so as initially drafted as you
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
heard the bill allowed anyone to make a
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
request for any reason to any person or
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
their business about their policy limits
 
01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
it then was narrowed down to just Auto
 
01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.310 align:start position:0%
it then was narrowed down to just Auto
liability

01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
liability
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
policies um this is still in our view an
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden and frankly just a
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy to those businesses
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
and individuals carrying Auto liability
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
policies and umbrella
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
policies it's in the interest as you've
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
already heard for all parties to settle
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
cases um without the expense of
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
litigation and having to hire
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys claims get settled every day
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
without attorneys invol involved I've
 
01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
had them personally I've been in an auto
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
accident I did not have to hire an
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
attorney um so generally this is not a
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
problem the voluntary the information is
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
voluntarily provided when there's good
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
reason to do so so for example when a
 
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
claimant's injuries are valued higher
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
than the policy limits it may be in the
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
insured's best interest to disclose the
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
policy limits to help expedite a faster
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
resolution to a claim and allow the
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
claimant to pursue their uninsured
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
underinsured motorist coverage and
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's typically when these situations
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
come up so if you have $200,000 in
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
Damages and a $50,000 policy limit the
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
insurer is going to say it's a $50,000
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
policy go use your own um
 
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:07.719 align:start position:0%
coverage but claims should really be
 
01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
based on alleged injuries and damages
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
your policy limit really shouldn't come
 
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
into play a mandatory disclosure of
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
policy limits may actually become an
 
01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
impediment in resolution if the
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyer is aware of a high
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
dollar policy limit and then focuses on
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
that limit rather than their actual de
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
damages so keep in mind also that
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
whether to disclose or not to disclose
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
is really up to the insurance company
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
whose duty is to protect their insured
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's not to um serve the interests of a
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
potential claimant who's seeking to sue
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
you so from the company's perspective
 
01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
that relationship is between the company
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
and their insured and that's where their
 
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
Duty lies and I think that's where came
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
up Mr Fox mentioned ins 3000 and as part
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
of that Duty confidentiality
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and insurance C companies
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't just go around giving out your
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
personal information right um and under
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
the RS there are times when they can
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
disclose that information and that would
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
be these scenarios so this bill would
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
conflict with that because the insurer
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
would have to give out the information
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
even if you don't authorize them to do
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
that um and James Fox will correct me if
 
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
I misstated that um so if there are rare
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
situations when a company is not
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
disclosing in a a limit for some reason
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
like if liability isn't clear or
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
claimant hasn't provided a legitimate
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
reason for requesting it a claimant May
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit and will automatically
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
receive that information as part of the
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
discovery process very early in the
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
litigation court and we already heard
 
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
there's a statutory requirement and then
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
there's also state and federal court
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
requirements this bill is really
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
one-sided and unlike in a number of
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
states a potential claimant is not
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
required to produce any information
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
about the request they can just say show
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
me your limit they don't have to provide
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
you any information about their damages
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
a police report medical records grounds
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
for liability there isn't a strict
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provision there aren't
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
any um clarifications in this bill that
 
01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
the information can't be used if the
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
case does go to court these are all
 
01:26:21.270 --> 01:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
Mutual disclosure requirements that we
 
01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
often see in the minority of states that
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
do have a resuit mandate there's a
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
mutual disclosure
 
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that's not what this bill
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
does it's completely
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
onesided transparency is a two-way
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
street so if a potential defendant is
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
required to disclose information then we
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
believe a potential plaintiff should
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
also be required to do the same the
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
majority of States remember do not
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
require preuit disclosure of policy
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
limits New Hampshire protects its
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
privacy we have a constitutional
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
amendment on privacy um and we feel like
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
this is an invasion of those privacy
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
rights frankly it's no one's business
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
how much Insurance you carry if this
 
01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill were to say how much do you have in
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
your bank
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
account I don't think you'd be in favor
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
of that and that's essentially what this
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
bill does it invites fishing Expeditions
 
01:27:19.149 --> 01:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
so that you know how deep someone's
 
01:27:22.109 --> 01:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
pockets are so in Most states like New
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently the nature and
 
01:27:25.629 --> 01:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
amount of insurance that you carry is
 
01:27:27.629 --> 01:27:27.639 align:start position:0%
private it's not subject to public
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
disclosure and we believe that's um that
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
status quo should be
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
held so the bill would subject people in
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
businesses to the burden of contacting
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
their insurance agent or their company
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
to confirm their coverage guess what
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
coverages might apply without even
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
potentially knowing what they're accused
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
of doing um and therefore we believe
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
that any utility of the legislation is
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
outweighed by its costs and we hope that
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
you will find it inexpedient to
 
01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.430 align:start position:0%
you will find it inexpedient to
legislate

01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%

this bill um to help me understand a
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
little further I I am a personal injury
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
attorney so I'll let you know how the
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
process goes and then why this bill
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
really is necessary um say somebody
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
comes in there a car accident and
 
01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:48.750 align:start position:0%
comes in there a car accident and
they're

01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
injured we investigate that claim the I
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't take a retainer I do all my cases
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
on contingency fee as most attorneys
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
like me do um so we have to investigate
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
we get their records I get their records
 
01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
from before the accident to make sure
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
they're not already experiencing the
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
these issues um and then we make a claim
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
with the insurance company now most
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are not the ones
 
01:29:17.070 --> 01:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
getting fined like Mr Fox said most they
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
negotiate with you and we're able to
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
resolve a case um and you know the value
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
of the case is what that investigation
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
that I put into it it it's not dependent
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
on what the policy limits are so so why
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
do we need them what's the big deal then
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
so this is where the the issues come
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
into play one where you've got say
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
you've got someone very seriously
 
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
injured and I'm doing my due diligence
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm getting all the records all the
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
bills I am providing them this is not
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
one-sided I'm giving all this
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
information to the insurance company um
 
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.550 align:start position:0%
information to the insurance company um
and

01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm doing all this work say the
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
person only has 50,000 in coverage and
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
they have 100,000 in medical bills why
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
am I going to keep doing all this stuff
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
if there's only 50,000 uh and I've had
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I have had to file suit because they
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't give it give up the the policy
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
limits were only to find out why didn't
 
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
you just tell me this but the most
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
important impact I think and it's as Mr
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
Fox explained um representative um
 
01:30:27.109 --> 01:30:27.119 align:start position:0%
macaller also mentioned is underinsured
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
motorist coverage and
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
again under you have underinsured
 
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
coverage if someone causes you
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
injury and you know you say I you have a
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
million dollar umbrella coverage
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
yourself if you don't know how much
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
coverage that person who caused your
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
injury has you don't know whether you
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
have an underinsured motorist case or
 
01:30:53.709 --> 01:30:53.719 align:start position:0%
not you can't compare unless you know um
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
and had to file a lawsuit because the
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
insurance company hasn't done that I had
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
a case where the person themselves had
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
$1.25 million in coverage you had a
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
permanent brain injury and will never
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
work again insurance company wouldn't
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
tell me I had to file suit because I
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
literally could not determine what what
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether he had an underinsured M his
 
01:31:18.189 --> 01:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
coverage um and under the court rules
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
you get them automatically you get the
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
you don't even have to request it you
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
get what the policy limits are um and uh
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
so it was a waste it was an absolute
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
waste um it wastes the burden of the
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
court because now they have to give you
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
a docket number jury trial date all of
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
that um we have to spend the money to
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
file the
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
lawsuit but then also you want to talk
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
about privacy who's the defendant in
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit I filed the individual the
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company is not on the other
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
side of that V that is Mr Jones who
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
caused the accident is now public record
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
anyone can look that up and see he's
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
been sued there's your privacy issue
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
right there um meanwhile if the
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company had just said oh yeah
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
well they also have 1.25 million in
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
coverage I know I have no underinsured
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
motorist claim now and I didn't have to
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
file that lawsuit that's why this is
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
necessary um like like um uh the
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
attorney before me said you know yeah a
 
01:32:26.470 --> 01:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
lot of times this is voluntarily done
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes it is and it's a very simple process
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
um I request the policy limits and they
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
just give them to me it's not burdensome
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
on the insurance company they have that
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
information uh and it's not as though I
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
say oh I think this is a $50,000 claim
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
oh you have a million dollars now it's a
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
million dollar claim it's not a million
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollar claim it's a $50,000 claim and we
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
never even touch the rest of that
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
coverage that's how that goes in
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
practice um and I'm happy happy to
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about how this goes
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
in practice all right thank you very
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
much um you have a question
 
01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:02.470 align:start position:0%
much um you have a question
representative

01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
portelli so can you tell thank you for
 
01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so can you tell me
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
what protections there are um legally to
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that you're that you're not
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
when you get the information about the
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
insurance limits that you're not trying
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
to increase the value of the lawsuit so
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
if you only have 50,000 and find out the
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
you know the other party has a million
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
you say okay we're going to get a big
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
payday what are the what are the um uh
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
processes in place that would prohibit
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
something like that so the I would say
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
the processes are the fact that the
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
insurance industry they're smart people
 
01:33:44.910 --> 01:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
right and we have to prove our claim
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
so if I make a claim say it's really
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
only a
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
$50,000 uh case and it's a million doll
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
policy say I make a million dollar
 
01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
demand they're not going to pay it
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to say where's your
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
evidence and if I don't have it that
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
case isn't going to settle um as a
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
practical matter a as a personal injur
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
attorney I substantiate every demand
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
that I make I don't just say I want a
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars I say look here are the
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
elements of my claim lost wages are x
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
amount and I write to the employer to
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
get substantiation for that medical
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
bills are this amount here's all the
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
bills here's all the medical records and
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
the and this is an exchange this is not
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
a one-way street it's an exchange we're
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
giving a lot of information to these
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
insurance adjusters pruit for them to be
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
able to make a determination as to what
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
the case should resolve for um and
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
they're smart they're good at their jobs
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
um they've
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
settled cases before just as I have and
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that's how the process goes um and I
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
and no attorney worth their salt is
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to make some ridiculous demand
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
because they know they're not going to
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
get a response to it and I think that's
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
where the protection is is that the the
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
industry knows what it's doing um and
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
and attorneys themselves aren't just
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
going to make some crazy demand because
 
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:15.159 align:start position:0%
then nothing's going to happen and it'll
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
be a waste of everybody's time I have a
 
01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:19.229 align:start position:0%
be a waste of everybody's time I have a
question

01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
um currently the attorney doesn't know
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
the policy limits most likely before
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
they accept the suit right before they
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
take the case correct usually so if so
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
my question is uh if let's say someone
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
has a million dooll legitimate claim but
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
the policy limit is only 250,000 so
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's 750,000 above the
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
claim and the attorney knows that in
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
advance before they accept their
 
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.270 align:start position:0%
advance before they accept their
client's

01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
client's
 
01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
case wouldn't it be harder for someone
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
to get get an attorney to accept the
 
01:35:57.870 --> 01:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
case if the attorney knows in advance
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
that the claim is far Bey beyond the
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
policy limits because it's much harder
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
to get assets from someone than it is a
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
payout from the an insurance company
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more work for the attorney
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
so couldn't it could it unfairly
 
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
Advantage the attorney to know that
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
information before they accept the case
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
because they would they would accept
 
01:36:19.270 --> 01:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
easy cases and maybe not accept more
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
difficult cases where assets are
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
required right right and I I think
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
understand your question if if as I
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
answer it it's clear I'm not I'm happy
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
to to to try again but so the the
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
situation is is that there's only
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
250,000 in coverage but there's a
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Damages and so what
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
happens with that person honestly I've
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
had cases where if we know what that
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
coverage is I I don't take the case I
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't take the case just to take like
 
01:36:53.790 --> 01:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
the 250,000 if the person could have
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
gotten it on their own anyway um so so
 
01:36:59.229 --> 01:36:59.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's one advantage there is
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
that person then if that 250 is offered
 
01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
to them they don't need me um yeah so
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that that was my question okay
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
so there's a million-- dollar legitimate
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
claim like in in uh in in the
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
metaphysical world that person deserves
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
a million dollars but there's only a
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
small amount of coverage the attorney
 
01:37:19.870 --> 01:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
knows that before accepting the case
 
01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
they may they may not have they may not
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
accept that case that person may have a
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
harder time getting an attorney oh oh so
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying so um I think
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to depend on the
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances but if if that's something
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
then we
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
learn for me I would just have the
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
person take the 250 if we know that
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
that's all that's there and the
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company just pays it and
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's no litigation now if the person
 
01:37:48.589 --> 01:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
wants to investigate are their personal
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
assets a lot of people don't know they
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
have underinsured motorist coverage as
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
well they they know oh well I know I
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
have $250 and a $1 million umbrella but
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's liability they don't know that in
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you automatically have
 
01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
underinsured coverage um and a lot of
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
time we can also look more broadly too
 
01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
to see what other insurance does exist
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
um so you know it I think it depends on
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
the circumstances it depends on what
 
01:38:21.149 --> 01:38:21.159 align:start position:0%
other assets might be available but I
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
don't think it would hinder I don't
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
think that situation would hinder that
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
person getting an attorney to get what
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
they would deserve um if they are being
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
offered the 250 and we know that all
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
there is is 250 I I will tell you I
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take the case because I'm not
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
just going to take a one-third
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
contingent fee on something I'm not
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to do any work on I would just the
 
01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
person would just make the claim on the
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
other person's insurance company and get
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
the max they can get thank you
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bros this is a would you
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
believe question question um I I know
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
that many many uh insur and your your
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
firm may be different in um law firms
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
who handle these kinds of cases
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
routinely the first thing they do is
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
figure out how much money is involved I
 
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
mean that's just a fact my husband is
 
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work for these firms and
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
if there's not enough money in it for
 
01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
them they refer them
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I don't want to speak to other
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
no I understand that I understand but it
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
is a routine practice that's what you
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
believe representative Gresley
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I certainly sympathize with
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
your situation here but I'm I'm looking
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
for something that that basically makes
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
a little more sense because I can
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
understand that if somebody just came in
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
somebody was in an accident and the
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
first thing they want to know is what
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
the insurance limits are so they can
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
maybe gain their case to get more money
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
whether it be 50 or $60,000 or or or $5
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
million is there any way that we can put
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
an amendment into this bill that would
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
say that that they have to disclose you
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
and I understand that when you make a a
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
claim a lot of them volun arily will
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
disclose what their limits are but what
 
01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
we do is we make it a requirement that
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
when you make your claim so you're
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
putting your money you you put your
 
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
cards on the table first and then
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
they're required to put their CS before
 
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
going to court because I think going to
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
court is is is senseless in this if we
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
can settle out of court and that's what
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here I think this is
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to do and I
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
think that if we could put some sort of
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
trigger in the law that says when you
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
file your claim that's your claim they
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
can now come back at you they can tell
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
you what the limits are and so then you
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
can start working and and it would
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
probably keep you out of in 99% of the
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
cases it'll probably keep you out of
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
court so the I I think the protection is
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the alternative of what you're
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
saying is fraud um attorneys can't do
 
01:40:38.589 --> 01:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
that um I I don't do it most attorneys I
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
think don't do it um and again I'm going
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
to go back to the insurance industry and
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
adjusters are very smart and
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable so they'll be able to
 
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
smell that a mile away for sure if
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
someone is just padding
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
something to go to I mean someone goes
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
to their doctor their doctor makes
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations and if it's it becomes
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
pretty obvious if things aren't
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate because the everything has to
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
be substantiated with medical opinion
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
for injuries or lost wages with you know
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
usually the employer or some something
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think the insurance industry is
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
very good at what they do and if there
 
01:41:25.070 --> 01:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
was any hint of that then then uh they
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
would know
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much thank you uh
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
eye good morning chairman hunt members
 
01:41:57.589 --> 01:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
of the House Commerce Committee thank
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me to speak this
 
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Joan Pao I'm the
 
01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:03.239 align:start position:0%
president of the big eye of New
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing the Independent
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance Agents throughout our state
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
and we strongly oppose Senate Bill
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
423 when this bill was brought forward
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
it pertained to all lines of insurance
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
when our association along with many
 
01:42:19.589 --> 01:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
other businesses and associations stood
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
together and opposed this bill they
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
amended it to include only
 
01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
automobile we continue to strongly
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill insurance has been My
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
Chosen career since
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
1979 and I've personally been involved
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
in an auto accident and I've been
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
treated fairly by the insurers that were
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
involved I don't believe mine was the
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
exception I believe insurance carriers
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
treat their insurance and cl claimants
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
fairly our insurance processes work
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
because of that underlying fairness
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not an attorney I'll start with that
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
and I have nothing against attorneys
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
some of my closest friends are attorneys
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding and it's been
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
brought out several times though when a
 
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
suit is filed the insurance limits must
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
be provided to the claimant's attorney
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
this makes sense to me this bill makes
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
it a requirement subject to a penalty in
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees for non-compliance to
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
provide liability coverage limits which
 
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
would include umbrella limits because
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
they're an extension of the automobile
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
limits before a suit has been brought
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense to me I believe
 
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's unwarranted an invasion of privacy
 
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
and for a lack of a better term a
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
fishing Expedition by the attorney let
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
me give you an example two car accidents
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
happen same scenario each time a vehicle
 
01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
is rear ended and the inj and the
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
injuries are the same first in both
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
instances the person struck the claimant
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
under this bill can now demand to know
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
your liability limits
 
01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
no suit being filed is necessary in the
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
first crash the at fault driver carries
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
minimum liability limits 2550 for bodily
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
injury in the second crash the ATA
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
driver carries
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
25500 limits for bodily injury plus a $5
 
01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.030 align:start position:0%
25500 limits for bodily injury plus a $5
million

01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
umbrella whose case do you think the
 
01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
attorney is going to
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
take proponents of this bill have said
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
the passage will streamline the court
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
process that doesn't makes sense to me I
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
believe it's naive to think that this
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill could streamline or reduce the
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
number of lawsuits I believe what it
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
will do is undermine the insurance
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
process that works here in New Hampshire
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
what it will do is cause unnecessary
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
work for the hardworking insurance
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
agents who have who will have to feel
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
demands for coverage limits what it will
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
do is take away the opportunity from the
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
Independent Insurance agent to advocate
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
for their clients with the insurance
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
carrier because once an attorney is
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
involved and retained the agents are
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
taken out of the process so even though
 
01:45:04.669 --> 01:45:04.679 align:start position:0%
they want to help their clients they
 
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
want to be their Advocate they
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
can't so on behalf of those thousands of
 
01:45:12.589 --> 01:45:12.599 align:start position:0%
hardworking Independent Insurance Agents
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I respectfully ask
 
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
that you vote Senate Bill 423
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate I thank you for
 
01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
your time and I'll be happy to try to
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
answer any question
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
question I guess we're all set thank you
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
Chase checking to see that it's still
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Representatives um
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Marissa Chase
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director for the New
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for jus which is a
 
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
euphemism for plaintiff's Trial Lawyers
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
Association um we are in support of this
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
bill um I just wanted to make two brief
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
points in Senator Carson's opening
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
statement and I went back and double-
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
checked this she was citing um a
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
narrative from an insurance defense firm
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
advocating for policies such as Senate
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 423 contains the insurance defense
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
firm I emailed that to the committee um
 
01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
they 50 state survey it's uh mat wicker
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
and larer they're a national civil
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
defense firm I wish we had some more
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
Insurance defense lawyers here to
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
testify and explain how the process
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
works I will share that when I have
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
spoken to them um they they would agree
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
that we thought this would be a
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
no-brainer um I understand that there
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
are some concerns I would note that this
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
started off in Senate
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and perhaps Judiciary is a
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
better committee that is more familiar
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
with how um the legal process works so I
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
understand the questions you have and I
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
hope that our members are doing our best
 
01:46:55.870 --> 01:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
to answer those questions um that's all
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
say fair enough any questions in the
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
committee members see none thank you
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
01:47:19.589 --> 01:47:19.599 align:start position:0%

based here in the Manchester office uh
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%

01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
include Insurance defense uh but I am
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
here representing State Farm one of the
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
leading writers of auto and home
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
insurance in the nation and also here in
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're here to oppose SB

423 um you've heard from others today

and likely may hear from from more uh
 
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
about the reasons that weos oos this
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
bill um we have share some of their
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
concerns um and I I will submit written
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record as well um this
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
morning but just to summarize its main
 
01:48:06.589 --> 01:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
points and without repeating too much um
 
01:48:06.599 --> 01:48:07.510 align:start position:0%
points and without repeating too much um
others

01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um as a practical matter under
 
01:48:14.430 --> 01:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
current law legitimate claimants can and
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
do obtain information about liability
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
coverage limits in the normal course of
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
a claim at the proper time and State
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
Farm has a lot of experience working
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
with similar bills in other states and
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
has identified a a list of problems with
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill um first as it's written SB
 
01:48:38.950 --> 01:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
423 could incentivize targeting of
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
people who purchase insurance so people
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
who make the responsible decision to
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
enter into private contracts for the
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
purchase of insurance um and it does
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
raise concerns that climan demands will
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
be I call it reverse
 
01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
engineered um meaning they will be
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
calculated to reflect the full amount or
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
at least approximating the full amount
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
of insurance coverage that may be
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
available rather than the amount that
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
really properly reflects the alleged
 
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:11.560 align:start position:0%
damages suffered by the injured party
 
01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
which are wholly independent from the
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
existence or not of insurance coverage
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
um and to be clear I I I want to be
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
clear that some lawyers do this lawyers
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
definitely do this I will exclude from
 
01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
from uh from that group The the very
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
well respected uh members of the
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
plaintiff bar who sit in the first row
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
here um who do the work to substantiate
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
their clients claims but not all lawyers
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
do that unfortunately it would make my
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
job easier if they did um others seem to
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
just say you know show me the money
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
where's the money without doing the work
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to substantiate those those
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
and and State Farm has seen also some
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
instances for example there's a law that
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
was fairly recently passed in Colorado
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
that's similar to this one where State
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
Farm has noticed instances where uh
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
requiring disclosure has actually
 
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
generated uh medically unnecessary
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
treatment because attorneys kind of push
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
their clients to go uh receive
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
additional Medical Services to pump up
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
the valuation of their
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
claims uh so second the also will likely
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
create some confusing overlap um with
 
01:50:30.270 --> 01:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
existing court rules and statutes that
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
require disclosure of the same
 
01:50:34.350 --> 01:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
information post initiation of
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
litigation and with different time
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
frames so right now claimants are
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to insurance policy information
 
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
after they filed a lawsuit and by the
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
way filing a lawsuit uh should only be
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
done for legitimate meritorious claims
 
01:50:49.709 --> 01:50:49.719 align:start position:0%
but it's not hard it's you something
 
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
that any any person any prosay plantiff
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
can can do without an attorney if they
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
feel like filing a two or three page
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
complaint or more longer with the court
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
and paying a small filing fee um but the
 
01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh the beauty of it is that by filing a
 
01:51:08.030 --> 01:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
complaint in court the claimant or their
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
attorney is essentially certifying to
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
the court that the claims that are
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
involved in that lawsuit are uh properly
 
01:51:19.709 --> 01:51:19.719 align:start position:0%
grounded in the law and in fact and
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
frivolous um but but yes insurance
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
information is among the very first
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
categories of required disclosures in
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
both state and federal courts the bill
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
as it's written though seems to allow
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
anyone to obtain that same otherwise
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
privately held policy information on
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
demand without any corollary requirement
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
that the requests be made in good
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
faith uh the third problem that State
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
Farm uh sees with this bill is that it
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
contains no or only minimal threshold
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
requirements or guard rails against
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
frivolous or unmeritorious claims um the
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
we've talked a little bit about how the
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
bill is very one-sided and the uh most
 
01:52:08.310 --> 01:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
recent Amendment adds some minimal guard
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
rails on the use for example of
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
disclosed policy limits by saying that
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
the claimant or claimants attorney shall
 
01:52:15.629 --> 01:52:15.639 align:start position:0%
utilize the disclosure only in
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
connection with the claim or lawsuit but
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
there are no penalties associated with
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
failure to adhere to that provision
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
um and if you look at how other states
 
01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
statutory or regulatory Frameworks deal
 
01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
with pruit disclosure policy limits um
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
among the the several states that
 
01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
require any pre-litigation disclosure of
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
liability policy limits and by the way
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers that I have for you know how
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
many states actually require these
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
things and and to what extent seem to
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
differ uh pretty substantially from the
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that Senator Carson had cited
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
earlier and others so um but
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
among those States many of them impose
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial threshold
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
requirements that are absent from this
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill uh for example a claimant has to
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
provide certain documents uh or evidence
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
supporting their claims confidentiality
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
protections apply to disclosed
 
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
information protections against
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessary disclosure of excess or
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
umbrella policy information um uh some
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
states would also uh restrict to
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
automobile insurance coverage but they
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
may also exclude for example Fleet
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
coverage so there are other
 
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
considerations and I I do want to note
 
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
that um uh it saddens me to hear Senator
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
Carson say that uh the the insurance
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
industry was unable to compromise but I
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
I want to specifically note that State
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
Farm did not agree to the amendment
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
language making the bill applicable to
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
Auto policies only uh they feel that
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
improperly targets uh entities like
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
insurers uh but so just to to to be
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
clear under new hampsh Under current New
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law our state is not an
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
outlier um it's it is it's relatively
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
few States about 18 plus DC that require
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
any pres disclosure of liability policy
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
limits by our uh by our uh research and
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
and um experience and among these Most
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um and um it's also notable
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
that about eight 18 other states that
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
have such a law ensure that the severity
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
of injury warrants the disclosure so I
 
01:54:32.069 --> 01:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
think in Virginia for example the the
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
plff has to prove that their medical
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
bills will exceed the minimum limits for
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh for coverage this bill doesn't have
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
any such provision there's also a bill
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
in Delaware that is one example of a
 
01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:45.069 align:start position:0%
in Delaware that is one example of a
better

01:54:45.069 --> 01:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
alternative and fourth and finally the
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
penalties in the bill are potentially
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
severe for insurers and they're one way
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
only Target tarting the insurer
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
um uh it's you know we're subjecting an
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
insurer to a financial pen penalty for
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
failure to comply which could encourage
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
some gamesmanship it's not clear when
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
the 30-day period exactly might start
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
how many letters can the person send to
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
trigger it um there's no penalties again
 
01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
built in for claimant or claimants
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
council's misuse of the policy info and
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
the $500 penalty uh I think it was $500
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
the last time I looked in the new New
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bill uh is pretty severe um
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
and there are perhaps only other I think
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
three states that impose penalties like
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire would be an outlier
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
if it if it did something like that and
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we oppose the bill
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
and ask the committee to do the same and
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions if it
 
01:55:42.189 --> 01:55:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
helpful I think they're all questioned
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
out thank you thank you uh chair we'll
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
oh red is good okay red is usually bad
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
in my
 
01:56:10.750 --> 01:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
business in anybody's business thank you
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%

01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Roger turge and I
 
01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
live in Dober New Hampshire I've been a
 
01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
trial lawyer for 43 years in New
 
01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire mass and Maine I have to be uh
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
an Governor at large of the nhj our
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
organization at any given time
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
represents perhaps 10 to 20,000 citizens
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
of residents of the State of New
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire involved in Tor claims um I
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
speak in support of 423 not just for the
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
nhj but personally I don't have much
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
skin in the game I'm going to be
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
retiring anytime I'm speaking on behalf
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
of those people who will be injured and
 
01:56:53.189 --> 01:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
have claims coming up in the the future
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
but they don't know who they are yet so
 
01:56:56.669 --> 01:56:56.679 align:start position:0%
they can't be here to speak to it they
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
they don't know they're going to have an
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
interest in this I support
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
423 because it's it's mainstream it's a
 
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
pretty common type of legislation across
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
the country and in New England we are
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
the only state that have doesn't have a
 
01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirement like this um two
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
of the states are motor vehicle specific
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Vermont and the other
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
three states are actually have broader
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements than we do so
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's mainstream it just makes common
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
sense it costs nothing to the insurance
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
companies whatever you've heard about oh
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
agents might be burdened by half to
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
responding to these things I can
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
guarantee you it doesn't it's not agents
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
the bill talks about insurer an agent is
 
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
not an insurer we know who the insurers
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
are we know who the claims people are
 
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are required to
 
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
make the disclosure I guarantee you that
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
whenever a claim comes to an adjuster's
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
desk one of the pieces of paper that's
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
been disclosed to that adjuster actually
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's not paper anymore it's it's on
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
their screen with their with on their
 
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
computer is the policy limits they're
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
not surprised by it they don't have to
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
do any extra work to look it up or to
 
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
tell anybody upon requests so it costs
 
01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
nothing it does save litigation as
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
Israel P padra said it is not an earth
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
shattering thing this is not going to
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
change the lives of thousands and
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of people in New Hampshire but
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
there are occasions where because we the
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
claimant can't find out the policy
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
number the policy limit or the
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
claimant's lawyer can't find out the
 
01:58:29.790 --> 01:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
policy limit we have to file a suit to
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
find out um what that number is that's
 
01:58:34.990 --> 01:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
represents a small expense that's going
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
to be passed on to the client it
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
represents an expense for the insurance
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
company that's greater because now they
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to hire a lawyer or they're paying
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know they've got a lawyer on salary
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
whose hours are taken up by dealing with
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
the litigation litigation has to go
 
01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
through some stages for about a month or
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
so before you get to the rule 22
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements by then you're
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
talking about who's our mediator going
 
01:58:59.709 --> 01:58:59.719 align:start position:0%
to be what's the timelines for Discovery
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
um how many people are we going to be
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
talking about as Witnesses oh and by the
 
01:59:05.229 --> 01:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
way what's the policy limit so a fair
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
amount of work has to get done to get to
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
a simple piece of information so it will
 
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
on occasion save a pie avoid a piece of
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
litigation that would otherwise be
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary not a big deal but it's it's
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
a help in those cases where it becomes
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
important um and to be honest with you
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
supports the very collegial atmosphere
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire we love to brag about
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
and it's true how collegial the
 
01:59:34.270 --> 01:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
atmosphere is between plaintiff's
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
lawyers the defense bar and the
 
01:59:39.669 --> 01:59:39.679 align:start position:0%
insurance adjusters we deal with the
 
01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
same lawyers and the same adjusters on
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
the other side all the time you know I I
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
have have had thousands of cases in my
 
01:59:49.709 --> 01:59:49.719 align:start position:0%
career and I've probably dealt with 50
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
different adjusters and 20 or 30
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
different lawyers our reputations with
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
each other mean a lot so the
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
gamesmanship you hear about the reverse
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
engineering you hear about that we're
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to reverse engineer our
 
02:00:04.189 --> 02:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
cases I don't do that I don't know
 
02:00:06.669 --> 02:00:06.679 align:start position:0%
anybody who does I can't say that nobody
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
will do it but the people will going to
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
do it because of the disclosure
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
requirement they're going to file suit
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
and they're going to do it anyway you
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
know the fact that you tell them early
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you is one thing I've
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
had any number of situations where and
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
and not involving my cases where
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers are not often shy
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
about reaching out to Injured parties
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
they're insured contact s say I was in a
 
02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
crash yesterday what I do what do I do
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
they get the information the information
 
02:00:37.709 --> 02:00:37.719 align:start position:0%
includes who's the person who got hit
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
and before you know it the person who
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
got hit is getting a phone call or a
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
letter from the insurance company saying
 
02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
we want to do right by you let's talk
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
and they make settlement
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
offers if they would to disclose the
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
policy limit and they could make it
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
instill make a settlement offer and get
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
a case settled that's great if they
 
02:00:58.270 --> 02:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
don't disclose the limit then that
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
person comes to me and ask any insurance
 
02:01:04.069 --> 02:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
agent any insurance industry
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative and they will they have
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
the statistics how much more do they pay
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
out on average on claims where people
 
02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
are represented by lawyers than on
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
claims where people settle their own
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
cases with the adjusters so it's
 
02:01:18.189 --> 02:01:18.199 align:start position:0%
actually to the insurance company's
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to disclose will in most cas
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
cases Will a smaller limit be disclosed
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
for the sake of getting the case over
 
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
with yes will there be cases where it's
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
not disclosed because I I'll call I'll
 
02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:32.270 align:start position:0%
not disclosed because I I'll call I'll
call

02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
adjusters when a when a case comes to me
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to do all the research
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
research ahead time but if I already
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
know that the person's been in the
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
hospital for a month or they've got 20
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
or $30,000 worth of bills I'll call on a
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
J say hey Jim um I've already got
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
$20,000 in bills the guy's still
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
treating it's a pretty serious injury
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
can can you tell what kind of a policy
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
you got here because if this is going to
 
02:01:57.310 --> 02:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
be a $25,000 settlement let's just do it
 
02:01:59.189 --> 02:01:59.199 align:start position:0%
quicker it's it's easier and cheaper and
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
quicker for everybody and if they tell
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
me they do you know I obviously I got to
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
do my due diligence and see if there's
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
other policies and things like that but
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
almost all the time the cases end up
 
02:02:12.510 --> 02:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
settling within the policy if you
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
know but if you don't know then you do
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
have to file the suit and those other
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
things happen um so I I'd like to think
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
that we have a very collegial atmosphere
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
here I do practice in other states where
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
it is a mandatory disclosure it's been
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
mandatory in Maine for 15 years and it's
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
been mandatory in Massachusetts
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
for almost as long as I've been
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
practicing maybe even since before us
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
practice I don't remember when it went
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
in what I can tell you is there's it's
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
never been an issue I mean it doesn't
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
cause any problems no no plaintiff's
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers act any differently on account
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
of knowing except we do reverse engineer
 
02:02:55.229 --> 02:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
the value of our cases and our willing
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
to settle based on the policy limit in
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
one situation where the policy limit is
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
smaller than what we think the case is
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
worth we will almost always almost
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
always agree to take a policy limit
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
settlement rather than pursue personal
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
assets or something along those lines in
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
40 some odd years and thousands of cases
 
02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:16.229 align:start position:0%
40 some odd years and thousands of cases
I've

02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
I've
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
seen it's either four or five cases and
 
02:03:21.550 --> 02:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
not all of them mine I've seen four or
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
five cases in which the the lawyers you
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
know pursued assets or something beyond
 
02:03:29.310 --> 02:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
the policy one of one or two of those
 
02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
were mine and the others were colleagues
 
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
and partners and such so we do reverse
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
engineer in the sense of taking less
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
than the case is worth if we know the
 
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
policy is you know too small um as long
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
as we've done our due diligence to make
 
02:03:45.549 --> 02:03:45.559 align:start position:0%
sure that you know we're not missing out
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
on another policy or something along
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
those lines um I could talk but I'd
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
rather just if there are any questions
 
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
I've heard intriguing questions I think
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very active panel here I think
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's great I'd love to if if if any of
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
the questions you've asked haven't been
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
answered to your satisfaction by others
 
02:04:03.629 --> 02:04:03.639 align:start position:0%
I'd love to take a shot at them for you
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
other than that I will stop thank you
 
02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:06.830 align:start position:0%
other than that I will stop thank you
for

02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
listening I think they're all set I
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
guess they're all set thank you much
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I got one card left Mike mofin
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
representing All
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
State and you're going to do three
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
minutes right Mike probably L all right
 
02:04:24.669 --> 02:04:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mike mcgl I'm a
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer and lobbyist in coner
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
representing allate Insurance I'll try
 
02:04:32.470 --> 02:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
not to repeat what's been said before
 
02:04:34.470 --> 02:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
but through my personal experience with
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
insurance I've had a few car accidents
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
and one of the most interesting things
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
is when the police come to the police
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
report they take your name they ask you
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
for your insurance card even though we
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't have mandatory Insurance New
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh they do get the insurance
 
02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:49.159 align:start position:0%
card I can talk to that personally
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
because it last 6 months in June I had a
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
card accident not my fault of course but
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
they did get the insurance card from me
 
02:04:58.109 --> 02:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
so the uh people had the information
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
available right then and there the thing
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
that I find troubling about this bill is
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
how about a multiple car accident three
 
02:05:07.629 --> 02:05:07.639 align:start position:0%
or four or five cars pile up by 93 you
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
have a b c d e f and g looking to does g
 
02:05:14.189 --> 02:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
get H does f get a who gets what from
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
who the Dynamics of uh the New Hampshire
 
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
Insurance Market commented earlier on by
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
the the insurance department I agree
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
with that and people keep saying we're
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
the only one who doesn't have this we
 
02:05:26.109 --> 02:05:26.119 align:start position:0%
the only one doesn't have that those are
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
the Dynamics in the inhabit Insurance
 
02:05:29.790 --> 02:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
Market which keep our rates as low as
 
02:05:32.109 --> 02:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
they are and in the automobile claim
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
world uh with the expensive cars as they
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
coming insurance premiums are getting
 
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
higher and higher so anything that
 
02:05:40.549 --> 02:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
changes the marketplace should will
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
probably have a negative effect on
 
02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
premiums the other part of the bill
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
which I think is kind of remarkable is
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
the restricting the information only to
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
automobiles I do not want to see it
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
broadened as it was in the Senate but
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between a broken
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
leg in a Chevy or a broken leg falling
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
on a faulty flight of stairs uh the
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
claim is a personal injury claim but if
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
it happens on all they want to get the
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
information um we don't see the need we
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
see the Dynamics in claims and
 
02:06:10.990 --> 02:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
settlements as illustrated by the
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
insurance department be the back and
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
forth that keeps a claim uh reasonable
 
02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
and Hampshire has been very good in um
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable recover recoveries just
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
recoveries for many many years so we
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill we like the system as it
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
is and we think it's working well thank
 
02:06:32.549 --> 02:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much having no more
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
cards I will close the public
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:06:43.149 --> 02:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
423 and we are half an hour late good
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill because think how long that one
 
02:06:52.390 --> 02:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
took us yesterday
 
02:06:56.589 --> 02:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:04.360 align:start position:0%
Apprentice you ready okay we're ready
 
02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.629 align:start position:0%
Apprentice you ready okay we're ready
Senator

02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
Apprentice we introduce her Bill thank
 
02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
you very much uh good morning chair hunt
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
members of house Commerce and consumer
 
02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
affairs longtime no see I am here to
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 556 as amended you
 
02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.030 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill 556 as amended you
would

02:07:22.030 --> 02:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
I trust you have the amended version um
 
02:07:25.709 --> 02:07:25.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
prohibits Insurance reimbursements
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
solely based on uh participating
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
providers licensure so very briefly uh
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
when we originally introduced this it's
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
been based on a problem in New Hampshire
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
where we don't well actually problem
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
Nationwide but specifically this applies
 
02:07:47.069 --> 02:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire where we don't have
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
enough Primary Care Providers Primary
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
Care Providers services are are either
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
Physicians or nurse practitioners and
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
they I they serve as what I refer to as
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
like a traffic cop when you have a PCP
 
02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
they see you they make decisions about
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
what referrals you may need for whatever
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
your complaint or condition is there's
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
some cases where you don't have to have
 
02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
a referral but a lot of them a lot of
 
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
the medical conditions and Specialties
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
like just to get an MRI you've got to
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
have a referral um so over time what has
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
come to Bear is that we don't have
 
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
enough Physicians that are primary care
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
physicians so the nurse practitioners
 
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
who are independently licensed to
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
practice just like the Physicians have
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
been acting or working as pcps providing
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
the same services but not reimbursed the
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
same way um and just you know quickly
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not with any disrespect to The
 
02:08:43.709 --> 02:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
Physician Community it's just this is a
 
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
nationwide problem uh my mother who is
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
now 92 and she doesn't like when I say
 
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
that moved to New Hampshire um two years
 
02:08:54.189 --> 02:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
ago and could not get a primary care
 
02:08:57.069 --> 02:08:57.079 align:start position:0%
physician and we live in you know like
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
the home of Health Care in New Hampshire
 
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
so she chose um to go with a nurse
 
02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%
practitioner and loves her nurse
 
02:09:06.910 --> 02:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner so with that being said we
 
02:09:09.069 --> 02:09:09.079 align:start position:0%
were initially seeking to bring parody
 
02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
in payment for services provided the
 
02:09:15.149 --> 02:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
same as Physicians the right now with
 
02:09:16.669 --> 02:09:16.679 align:start position:0%
the acception of Anthem who does
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
reimburse for Primary Care and
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health at 100% um Health
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
insurers were primarily following the
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
CMS guidance which is 80 the nurse
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
practitioners are reimbursed at 85% of
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
what the Physicians are um
 
02:09:34.589 --> 02:09:34.599 align:start position:0%
so during discussions we initially had
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
passed it with parody um but it wouldn't
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
work uh based on all the different types
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
well all the different carriers um and
 
02:09:45.069 --> 02:09:45.079 align:start position:0%
we were looking at amending the nurse
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
pract the nurse Practice Act versus
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
really and with the thanks of Heidi
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
croll and the the insurance providers
 
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
worked towards amending the statute
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
which is 420j which has to do with
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
provider contract standards instead to
 
02:10:02.549 --> 02:10:02.559 align:start position:0%
try to incrementally get us to where I
 
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
think ultimately we need to be is for
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
same for same Services same pay but for
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
now the position is let's highlight this
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
and provide clarification in the
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
provider contract standards so Nerf
 
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners especially the ones that
 
02:10:19.229 --> 02:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
are the leads for practices they can
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
actually point to this in the law and
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the different insurance
 
02:10:26.669 --> 02:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
companies to get a better rate and
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately get the same as positions
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
which is 100% so that we introduced it
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
for parity we amended to bring Clarity
 
02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
um I thank both the nurse practitioners
 
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
and the insurance carriers for getting
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
at the table and trying to find a
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
solution to this so we can you know do
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
better by our granted stators in terms
 
02:10:49.069 --> 02:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
of uh primary care and um including you
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
know just general primary care and
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and and that's my
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
those are my opening remarks I'm happy
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
to take any questions you might
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
spear it's it says uh on line
 
02:11:06.430 --> 02:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
four uh that reimbursement Provisions
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
licensure what do I do with solely I I I
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
can't figure out as someone trying to
 
02:11:17.599 --> 02:11:19.390 align:start position:0%
can't figure out as someone trying to
evaluate

02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
02:11:21.629 --> 02:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
legislation what do I do with words
 
02:11:24.990 --> 02:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
solely I I mean I don't know what to say
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question but as
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
it is right now lure is used in
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for Primary Care and
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
behavioral F Health based as the
 
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
criteria by which reimbursement is made
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
so what I am asking and I again worked
 
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
with um the insurance carriers is to
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
change that so that when they are
 
02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
negotiating they can't use that as the
 
02:11:51.589 --> 02:11:51.599 align:start position:0%
primary decision maker clarification
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
please um so let's talk about the word
 
02:11:58.350 --> 02:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
soy okay okay okay so um soy is a very
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
famous word in this committee room and
 
02:12:05.549 --> 02:12:05.559 align:start position:0%
it goes back to that um when the bill
 
02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
the bills the issue we've always had was
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
um uh auto insurance rates and that auto
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
insurance uh would sometimes use your
 
02:12:15.199 --> 02:12:16.390 align:start position:0%
insurance uh would sometimes use your
credit

02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
report as to uh decide on what uh
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to make for you and offer
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
on insurance so we've had this
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislation we've had many time where
 
02:12:27.390 --> 02:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
the issue came in what are we going to
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
do what are we going to do and there
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
came that word
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
solely because an insurance company when
 
02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:37.559 align:start position:0%
it makes its reimbursements rates what
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to reimburse it has
 
02:12:43.310 --> 02:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
to have data behind it to why it uses
 
02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
you know whatever criteria uses it has
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
to prove that that criteria is a
 
02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:49.669 align:start position:0%
to prove that that criteria is a
legitimate

02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
criteria and so so the word solely um
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
was sense that that you were not going
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
to get your uh insurance rate simply
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
because you had a bad credit report
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
there had to be other things in there so
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
in this case it would be that they're
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
not going to solely reimburse because
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's a nurse practitioner they're going
 
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
to use other statistics such as U your
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
degrees or what what um how many years
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
you were
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
how many what's your all these other
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
things um I would say over the past
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
years um we used to have a big thing
 
02:13:30.910 --> 02:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
about being board
 
02:13:33.069 --> 02:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
certified and that Physicians had to be
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
board certified and that was a criteria
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
so uh over the years these issues of
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
what is an insurance company can use for
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
setting that rate now normally uh when
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
it comes to the uh primary care
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
physician the rate is really somewhat
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
set based upon where they are where the
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
market area is and what's the going you
 
02:13:55.549 --> 02:13:55.559 align:start position:0%
know uh what it has been for other
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians but in this case
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
um you're saying it based upon your
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
practice so it's not just a primary care
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
in this case it's not just primary care
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
and nurse practitioners it can be
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
anything the way this is said solely is
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
that can be anything the health
 
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier when they're going to
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
reimburse and what they're whatever rate
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to agree to whatever
 
02:14:19.350 --> 02:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to offer that's and this
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
is negotiated by the way
 
02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to show uh
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
that there is some uh statistical
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
history about why they got to the number
 
02:14:31.390 --> 02:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
they got so that's where the word solely
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
comes from so you're saying it actually
 
02:14:36.229 --> 02:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
has a real meaning because it seems to
 
02:14:38.189 --> 02:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
me that just the way this is written
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
without anything in there it could be
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
because your hair is brown I mean
 
02:14:45.310 --> 02:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
anything they would have to be able to
 
02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
show statistically that someone who had
 
02:14:49.990 --> 02:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
brown hair does it say something in here
 
02:14:52.990 --> 02:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
about that having to that again
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
again they say this that's an inside you
 
02:14:58.629 --> 02:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
know how insurance is done so yes this
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
this word this way this is written has
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
deep meaning terms of the department and
 
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
they will they'll come up and tell you
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay they will testify but it absolutely
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
has meaning and that is when you're
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
negotiating the rate they can't simply
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
say well that's you're a nurse
 
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
practitioner so we're going to pay you
 
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
less simply because you're a nurse
 
02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:21.149 align:start position:0%
less simply because you're a nurse
practitioner

02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
represent thank you for taking my
 
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um question
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
about uh leveling of costs right so if
 
02:15:33.549 --> 02:15:33.559 align:start position:0%
you have different license types that
 
02:15:37.149 --> 02:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
are getting reimbursed differently um
 
02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
and and you have to ignore the insurance
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
company has to ignore uh the license
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
type uh where how do they level those
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
costs between you know different license
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
types that have different level of
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
training we do have someone from the
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department so I think they can
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
they can take that all right thank you
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
for the question we have someone from
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance department that's great
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
like okay any other questions for the
 
02:16:07.310 --> 02:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
senator yes thanks for taking my
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
question um as uh the chair mentioned
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
that um you know they need to rely on
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
data to come to these conclusions and
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm reading um frankly I I was
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised to see that a lot
 
02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
of studies show that nurse practitioner
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
ERS and um Physicians provide the same
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
level of care so is that going to be
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
taken into account
 
02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
in thank you for the question
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative burrow so we um they do
 
02:16:34.589 --> 02:16:34.599 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason that we're here
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
but um initially we propose I propos
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that standards uh we we know
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
that an Anthem is already doing this
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
others are not but are open to the
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
conversation it's how to get that there
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
and it belongs in one the insurance
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
statute not the nurse practice act so as
 
02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
a step to get this moving
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
forward the compromise was to use the
 
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
level of licensure um in the contract
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations by these nurse Le nurse
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
practitioner Le practices to have
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
something to point their finger to to
 
02:17:12.509 --> 02:17:12.519 align:start position:0%
try to get a better rate and get closer
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
to the same level of rates that the
 
02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
Physicians have that's that's the best
 
02:17:18.509 --> 02:17:18.519 align:start position:0%
that we're at right now and it was a
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
brilliant compromise it was
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
proposed by others and agreed to uh by
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
the crew thank
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
you just uh represent Herbert has a
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
question yeah I wonder excuse
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
me my understanding my understanding is
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
that uh primary care physicians are
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
becoming rare yes and that the hospitals
 
02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
are I don't know what they're doing with
 
02:17:49.950 --> 02:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
them I I actually happen to really like
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
my primary care physician so and I'm not
 
02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
knocking the uh what was the uh
 
02:17:59.709 --> 02:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
difference um that you mentioned if
 
02:18:01.309 --> 02:18:01.319 align:start position:0%
you're not a primary care who else is
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
doing it the nurse practitioners nurse
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
practitioner who were here Y and I uh
 
02:18:11.349 --> 02:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not dissing that at all and
 
02:18:14.669 --> 02:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
in fact the data in you know indicates
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
that they do a really good job but I'm
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
my question is do you
 
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
how do we uh preserve the primary care
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
physician because I think they're in in
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh difficulty so thank you uh for the
 
02:18:34.629 --> 02:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
question representative Hebert uh I the
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
best way for me to answer that is that
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
we we're aware of the problem in New
 
02:18:41.070 --> 02:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're aware of the problem
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
nationally I'm going to point to the um
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
Office of the State Office of rural
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
Health which brings as funding from the
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
federal government and works to do uh
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
loan reimburse um student loan payback
 
02:18:55.389 --> 02:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
programs to recruit you know specific
 
02:18:58.469 --> 02:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
types of Physicians into the state um to
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
help that's just one example to help
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
alleviate this problem which is you know
 
02:19:06.910 --> 02:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
really honestly at a crisis State U for
 
02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
Primary Care so there have been and
 
02:19:10.870 --> 02:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's probably the example I can point
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
to most quickly as a strategy to address
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%

02:19:41.709 --> 02:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
Heaton hello Michelle Heaton I'm the
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
director of Life and Health at the New
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll start off by answering some
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the questions the way this kind of
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
started out was under CMS guidelines for
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare reimbursement they allow a step
 
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
down in reimbursement rates for aprns
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
and PAs and this is Nationwide and it's
 
02:20:09.870 --> 02:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
good to note that Across the Nation the
 
02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
scope of practice for aprns is different
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a very broad
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and the APRN can
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
practice independently and they can
 
02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
prescribe so in that respect they are on
 
02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
the same level as doctors um so under
 
02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:29.389 align:start position:0%
the same level as doctors um so under
the

02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:33.309 --> 02:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare system there is a set rate and
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
that is the 100% rate that the doctor
 
02:20:35.760 --> 02:20:37.070 align:start position:0%
that is the 100% rate that the doctor
would

02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
get the CMS system allows an APRN to
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
have a reduced amount of 85% of that
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
rate it is not mandatory it is allowed
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
so I think this this is what this bill
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
was intended to do is that assuming all
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
things are level in provider
 
02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement you can't just knock them
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
down to 85% of what you would have paid
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
them just because they are an APRN so
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's the issue that we're trying to
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
fix here um in this state yes there's
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
work short for Workforce shortages for
 
02:21:13.950 --> 02:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
um healthc care providers you know all
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
over the place for that reason that is
 
02:21:19.469 --> 02:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
why the market has required aprns to be
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursed in new Hamp at a higher rate
 
02:21:23.309 --> 02:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
and that's why I believe Anthem
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
reimburses them um on par with doctors
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
because they understand we need Primary
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
Care Providers and we're going to have
 
02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
to pay them more when we're talking
 
02:21:34.710 --> 02:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
about provider reimbursement there
 
02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
are it's rare that two doctors are going
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
to make the same amount there's a number
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
of factors that go into their
 
02:21:43.349 --> 02:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
contractual negotiations between the
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
health carrier and the provider and
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
those can include um the geographic area
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
they're in the type of practice they
 
02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
have how many patients under you know a
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
carrier's plan go to that practice how
 
02:21:59.790 --> 02:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
their expertise um how long they've been
 
02:22:01.429 --> 02:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
practicing you know do they have
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
enhanced certifications all of those
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
factors go into contractual negotiations
 
02:22:09.309 --> 02:22:09.319 align:start position:0%
and setting the reimbursement rates what
 
02:22:12.510 --> 02:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is make it so
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
assuming all of those other factors are
 
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
even you can't reimburse aprns or PAs or
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
any other license sh at a lower level
 
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
than at a the level for a doctor so I'm
 
02:22:28.469 --> 02:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions I hope that
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%

you to support that nurse practitioners

be provided equal reimburse M for
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
performing the same service as our
 
02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
physician colleagues closing the

that all patients have access to
 
02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
highquality health care I'm confident
 
02:26:35.950 --> 02:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
that this will have a positive impact on

croll good morning Mr chairman members
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee um for the record my
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
name is Heidi croll um I work at
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
Gallagher cahan and gartrell and I
 
02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
represent ahip which is America's health
 
02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
insurance plans um I'd say at this point
 
02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
we're neutral on the bill is um you've
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
heard from um Senator um Apprentice um
 
02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
we did oppose s SP 558 as introduced um
 
02:27:29.990 --> 02:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
and also some earlier draft amendments
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:27:34.349 --> 02:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
bill um so we did uh oppose the payment
 
02:27:37.230 --> 02:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
parody mandate um where all nurse
 
02:27:39.150 --> 02:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners would um kind of
 
02:27:41.070 --> 02:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
automatically be paid the same as
 
02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians um we objected to that fact
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
um to to that for a number of reasons
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
one um that a payment parody mandate
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
would be government intervention or
 
02:27:53.269 --> 02:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
interference um into private contract
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations between the two um private
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
entities um as you know and as you've
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
heard and discussed reimbursement rates
 
02:28:03.030 --> 02:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
are negotiated um between providers and
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
insurers and there's no really one
 
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
formula um or set reimbursement rate for
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
a provider regardless of what type of
 
02:28:13.670 --> 02:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
Provider you're talking about um for the
 
02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
more earlier versions of sp sp 556 um
 
02:28:19.550 --> 02:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
really would have been um unworkable um
 
02:28:21.469 --> 02:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
because there there is no single
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for Physicians so it
 
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
was kind of like what parody with what
 
02:28:30.190 --> 02:28:30.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh and as you heard it would have
 
02:28:31.950 --> 02:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
Tim been going into the um nurse
 
02:28:33.429 --> 02:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
practitioner statutes which just would
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
have been problematic from a perspective
 
02:28:38.190 --> 02:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
of carriers need to be confident that
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
when they are looking at the insurance
 
02:28:42.269 --> 02:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
statutes that those are the laws that
 
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
they need to be um complying with um so
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
with all of that said ahip did have a
 
02:28:47.790 --> 02:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
number of discussions with um Senator
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
Apprentice um the bill spye sponsor and
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
Advocates and ultimately offered um the
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
language that is before you today um
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
that we thought could um you know offer
 
02:29:01.150 --> 02:29:01.160 align:start position:0%
a reasonable alternative path forward so
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I perfect thank you
 
02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.590 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I perfect thank you
thank

02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:29:08.830 --> 02:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
you all right so I have no opposition to
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%

about three minutes and uh I I used to
 
02:29:19.309 --> 02:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to say please don't repeat
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
with someone else's already said which
 
02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
might not be leave you with a lot to say
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
but uh we do want to hear from you all
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%

Ohan yeah thank H there you go good
 
02:29:37.349 --> 02:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you for your time I
 
02:29:39.389 --> 02:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
will keep my remarks quite short I'm the
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner Association I'm
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
joined today by several of my colleagues
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point out a couple of things
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's been references this morning to
 
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
that is a that is an accurate term
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
however I want to be clear when you're
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
selecting a PCP it when you as a when
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
you are when when you purchase your
 
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
insurance and you select your PCP you
 
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
are selecting a primary care provider
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
which all of the commercial insurers in
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire agree that a nurse
 
02:30:10.269 --> 02:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
practitioner is equal in being able to
 
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
to be that person as as as your
 
02:30:15.469 --> 02:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
physician so um representative Herbert
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
you you mentioned that you have a
 
02:30:18.750 --> 02:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
primary care physician that that you
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
really enjoy but you're concern about um
 
02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
how are we going to make sure that
 
02:30:26.469 --> 02:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
everybody has the ability to have a PCP
 
02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
well we do that by making sure that
 
02:30:30.269 --> 02:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
everybody can afford to stay in business
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
and part of how we do that is we make
 
02:30:33.550 --> 02:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
sure that they are reimbursed for the
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
services that they provide at a rate
 
02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
that Mak sense and it's fair I will say
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire Medicaid has
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
recognized this for a long time there's
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
been parody nurse practitioners and
 
02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians are paid equally for the
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
services that they provide by New
 
02:30:50.790 --> 02:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid we do have data that
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
will show um we we we've seen in some of
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
the insurers policies that they clearly
 
02:30:58.429 --> 02:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
state that they will pay nurse
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners at the 85% following
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
Medicare so we know what happening in
 
02:31:06.309 --> 02:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we also have data analysis
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
done by the all claims database which is
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
um which clearly shows we we've looked
 
02:31:16.150 --> 02:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
at it um a a group has looked at it and
 
02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
they've looked at the
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
99214 um billing code which which is a
 
02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
pretty General visit and they've laid
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
out all of the uh primary care physician
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
or primary care provider Primary Care
 
02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
practices in New Hampshire so all across
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
the state they've looked out physician
 
02:31:36.590 --> 02:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
Le nurse practitioner Le and combined
 
02:31:38.309 --> 02:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
and we and then they've looked at all
 
02:31:39.950 --> 02:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
the commercial insurers put them all in
 
02:31:42.150 --> 02:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
a column and then they sort them and
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
clear as day all of the nurse
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
practitioner owned and led practices
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
fall at the bottom third so when we talk
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
about how we make sure that we keep
 
02:31:51.950 --> 02:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
those PC PS we got to make sure that
 
02:31:54.550 --> 02:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're not vulnerable just because they
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
have a different license to that gets
 
02:31:58.750 --> 02:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
them to be able to do the same exact
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
service so I'm going to leave it to my
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:23.880 align:start position:0%

committee I'm Nancy Wilson a former
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner I was employed by
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
conquered family medicine for over 10
 
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
years I'll make this short because um
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
most of this has been covered already
 
02:32:41.110 --> 02:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
but I am today testifying in support of
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no no you had it on you just
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
need to do closer you you need to turn
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
it back on and then keep it Clos um
 
02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
right so you you notice how close I keep
 
02:32:53.990 --> 02:32:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:32:56.469 --> 02:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
um I'm as I said I'm testifying in
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
support of SB uh
 
02:33:02.269 --> 02:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
556 uh which addresses payment parody to
 
02:33:05.710 --> 02:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nurse practitioners um we
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh do enjoy a a broad uh scope of
 
02:33:10.990 --> 02:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
practice uh which has been established
 
02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
for years here in New Hampshire uh it's
 
02:33:17.429 --> 02:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
really important to know um that each
 
02:33:20.349 --> 02:33:20.359 align:start position:0%
state actually has their own scope SC of
 
02:33:26.110 --> 02:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
practice um not ideal but uh here in New
 
02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are actually able to
 
02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:29.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we are actually able to
practice

02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
autonomously um and uh therefore assume
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
the same liability risks uh as physician
 
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
practices same overhead uh and because
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire particularly uh small
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
businesses seem to be the backbone of
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
this state uh it's important for nurse
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
practitioner to be able to um realize uh
 
02:33:56.349 --> 02:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
the benefits of opening their own
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
practice and I would like to support
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
this bill would support that thank you
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
great thank you very
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
much if you have written testimony you
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
can certainly submit it to the clerk we
 
02:34:17.269 --> 02:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.429 --> 02:34:20.439 align:start position:0%
abot am I the last no
 
02:34:23.190 --> 02:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
no all right I will talk quick thank you
 
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
very much for inviting me to speak here
 
02:34:28.110 --> 02:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Peggy Abbott I'm a
 
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatric nurse
 
02:34:32.230 --> 02:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
practitioner I work in a treatment
 
02:34:34.269 --> 02:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
center and I help people who deal with
 
02:34:36.429 --> 02:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
mental illness as well as their
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
addictions New Hampshire needs more
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
psychiatric providers in the community
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
to help these people maintain sobriety
 
02:34:46.790 --> 02:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
while taking care of their mental health
 
02:34:48.790 --> 02:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
many psych providers have long weight
 
02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
many psych providers have long weight
lists

02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
lists
 
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
I know of several psych nurse
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
practitioners that take cash paying
 
02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
clients because the reimbursement rates
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
from the insurance companies isn't
 
02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable to support overhead and
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
living expenses the ones who do take
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
insurance have incredibly long weight
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
list for clients to be seen and it's
 
02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
very defeating for someone to beat
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
addiction and get mental health
 
02:35:15.710 --> 02:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
treatment while in recovery but they
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
can't have support once they're in the
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
community I also have have a private
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
practice and take insurance including
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the number of inquiries for new
 
02:35:28.030 --> 02:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
appointments has been overwhelming and
 
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
the most of the calls are from people
 
02:35:31.630 --> 02:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
who have Medicaid saying they've been
 
02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
calling around for months trying to get
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
treatment for their mental health I got
 
02:35:39.309 --> 02:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
credentialed with Medicaid because I was
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
sad hearing the size from people on the
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
other end of the phone when I had told
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
them that I wasn't they'd beg me to help
 
02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
find them somebody who could see them
 
02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
stating nobody takes my
 
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
insurance Medicaid is known for its
 
02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
lower reimbursement rate the patients
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
are usually the sickest so we want to
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
help them with the low reimbursement
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
rates from our commercial insurers it's
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
difficult and we use that balance to
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
make ends
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
meet it's clearly stated in the
 
02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
insurance contracts that our physician
 
02:36:14.190 --> 02:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues can get 15% more
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement than we do for the same
 
02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
services to similar patients how is this
 
02:36:19.279 --> 02:36:20.870 align:start position:0%
services to similar patients how is this
failed

02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
failed
 
02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
patients appreciate nurse practitioners
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
and seek the quality of treatment we
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
provide we are first trained as nurses
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
and have the holistic approach that
 
02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
patients like and Trust we are not less
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
than our physician colleagues we are
 
02:36:37.389 --> 02:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
simply another Choice our care should
 
02:36:38.429 --> 02:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
not be
 
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
discounted there's a constant growing
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
need for psychiatric providers in New
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dual diagnosis is rampant in
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
our state a quality reimbursement for
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
the vital services we provide would show
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
our worth within the insurance company
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire who pay
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
out of pocket for treatment because the
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
insurance rate reimbursement rate is so
 
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
low would appreciate it especially when
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
coverage thank you okay so I just want
 
02:37:10.830 --> 02:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand because did
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
you say Medicaid does pay a difference
 
02:37:16.269 --> 02:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
or does is doesn't pay a difference
 
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
parody I thought you just said that
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
there was a 15 Medicaid there was a 15%
 
02:37:23.550 --> 02:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
difference no okay all right I
 
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstood what you said no it's just
 
02:37:27.309 --> 02:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement can be a little
 
02:37:29.309 --> 02:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
bit lower than the insurance companies
 
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
that we know that Medicaid is the lowest
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
of all possible reimbursements so we use
 
02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
the commercial insurance is to balance
 
02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
out Medicaid okay great uh we do have a
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I'm sorry
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
I probably should have asked this sooner
 
02:37:49.750 --> 02:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
but can you and if not you then maybe
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
someone else can answer what's the
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
difference between a physician's
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
assistant and a nurse practitioner and
 
02:37:58.790 --> 02:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
the level of training versus a
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
physician's level of training okay
 
02:38:04.269 --> 02:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so nurse
 
02:38:07.750 --> 02:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners are nurses so we've gotten
 
02:38:10.349 --> 02:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
uh training as a nurse whether it's it's
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
probably registered nurse with a
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree and then we have extra
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
training as a at a master's level and we
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
are board certified in our
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
Specialties Physicians assistants are um
 
02:38:27.230 --> 02:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
they have a bachelor's degree and then
 
02:38:30.190 --> 02:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
they get two years more of training in
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
environment and did you ask about
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians yeah yeah I mean Physicians
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
get seven to eight years of college
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
training and and exper residency and
 
02:38:48.870 --> 02:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay yeah so follow for question
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%

02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
aqualia good morning it's aqualina
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
aqualina night's
 
02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
try all right so I understand that this
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill is geared toward primary care but
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
it also affects me as a licensed
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor um so
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
first I wanted to thank you for even
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
considering this bill um um because
 
02:40:22.750 --> 02:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement parody among licensed
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health Counselors and
 
02:40:26.429 --> 02:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
licensed social workers has been a fight
 
02:40:28.030 --> 02:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
that I've been having since I opened my
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
practice in
 
02:40:33.750 --> 02:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
2021 um the reimbursement practices for
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health are discriminatory at
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
just about every insurance company um
 
02:40:41.710 --> 02:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll say that I worked for a
 
02:40:44.110 --> 02:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
psychological practice before I hung my
 
02:40:47.269 --> 02:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
own shingle and I took a 30% cut from
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
not working under a psychologist
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and practicing
 
02:40:54.590 --> 02:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
independently um
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
so I run bod Counseling Services which
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
is a 27 clinician practice and it has a
 
02:41:02.429 --> 02:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
state rde reach and is currently serving
 
02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
over 1,00 active clients pay equity for
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors has been a
 
02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
Forefront issue since we opened and not
 
02:41:11.950 --> 02:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
a day has gone by that either my I or my
 
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
administrative staff haven't fought with
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to get paid fairly
 
02:41:17.710 --> 02:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
for the work we're doing I also had to
 
02:41:19.030 --> 02:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
recently make the difficult decision to
 
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
not take Medicare at my practice and it
 
02:41:23.309 --> 02:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
was because of this
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
issue uh the inequitable reimbursement
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
practices because social workers and
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
licensed clinical Mental Health
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
Counselors do the same work but they're
 
02:41:31.439 --> 02:41:33.030 align:start position:0%
Counselors do the same work but they're
reimbursed

02:41:33.030 --> 02:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
02:41:34.630 --> 02:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
differently and I'm going to give you
 
02:41:36.070 --> 02:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
sort of the cliff not Cliffs notes
 
02:41:37.710 --> 02:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
version of my written testimony because
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a pretty specific
 
02:41:42.030 --> 02:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
story about um an issue that I have with
 
02:41:44.190 --> 02:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medicaid but my primary
 
02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
question actually that I'm coming to you
 
02:41:48.269 --> 02:41:48.279 align:start position:0%
with is would this bill also cover
 
02:41:48.279 --> 02:41:51.269 align:start position:0%
with is would this bill also cover
Medicaid

02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:55.070 --> 02:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
no no okay I would ask that you consider
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
that a cover Medicaid if it's possible
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
um because Private Practice licensed
 
02:42:02.269 --> 02:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
clinical Mental Health Counselors make
 
02:42:04.190 --> 02:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
80% of what they do in Community Mental
 
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
Health Centers and so it's because of so
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at the fee schedule which is
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
public information licensed clinical
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Counselors the rate is 80%
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
of the same service in the same billing
 
02:42:20.590 --> 02:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
code um it and so we just had a pretty
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
big rate increase for Medicaid back in
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
January which I'm very very thankful for
 
02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your work on that
 
02:42:29.710 --> 02:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
whatever your role in that was but the
 
02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
margin is still unacceptable so be so
 
02:42:35.550 --> 02:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
before the rate increase we were paid
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
67% of what Community Mental Health
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
Centers were paid and if Community
 
02:42:42.429 --> 02:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers didn't have such
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
long waiting lists and those clients
 
02:42:46.030 --> 02:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
were not coming through our doors I
 
02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be making such hay out
 
02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
of this issue but
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's at least one Community Mental
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
Health Center that doesn't even have
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
clinicians and isn't keeping a waiting
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
list and so they come to us and so we're
 
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
serving higher and higher Acuity clients
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
for much lower wages and this is across
 
02:43:05.550 --> 02:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
the board Medicaid just happens to be
 
02:43:07.230 --> 02:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
the most glaring issue but it's
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
happening across the board with all
 
02:43:12.269 --> 02:43:12.279 align:start position:0%
insurance companies um
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate your
 
02:43:16.990 --> 02:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
time I gave you my written testimony but
 
02:43:18.030 --> 02:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you the cliffs note
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
like I just wanted to make it brief no
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much all right one
 
02:43:27.630 --> 02:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
card left Sabrina dunand from antrum and
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
now I know what you wrote there I think
 
02:43:32.710 --> 02:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
you meant to say neutral but you forgot
 
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
the T sorry about that so very messy
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
handwriting well thank you anyway um yes
 
02:43:40.750 --> 02:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
neutral um Sabrina Dunlap director of
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
government relations for Anthem and
 
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate um Senator apprentice and
 
02:43:46.710 --> 02:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders looping us all in
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
early and this was a collaborative
 
02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:49.670 align:start position:0%
early and this was a collaborative
process

02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out one thing to
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
the earlier issue that came up
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
um uh hoping that we can change provider
 
02:44:00.750 --> 02:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
to specify that it is limited to aprns I
 
02:44:02.510 --> 02:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
would defer to the nurse practitioners
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
as to what exactly the the correct
 
02:44:06.190 --> 02:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
phrases I don't know if it's NP I think
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's APRN um but just to clarify because
 
02:44:11.790 --> 02:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise that becomes a relatively
 
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
broad Amendment to the existing
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
statute I think we just discussed that
 
02:44:22.030 --> 02:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
by the person who testified before I so
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
wondering whether it's going to cover a
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
mental health provider well I think
 
02:44:28.269 --> 02:44:28.279 align:start position:0%
aprn's probably broad enough to cover
 
02:44:31.550 --> 02:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
medical and and mental health but um
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
this provider would apply conceivably to
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
every provider so so hoping to limit it
 
02:44:41.230 --> 02:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
to just nurse practitioners okay well
 
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
make note of
 
02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
that I did just chat with Susan pasel I
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
think they're okay with that because
 
02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
that was our Collective understanding
 
02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you all right uh
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
having no more cards I will close the
 
02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:57.429 align:start position:0%
having no more cards I will close the
public

02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:44:57.439 --> 02:45:01.469 align:start position:0%
public
hearings

02:45:01.469 --> 02:45:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
not 558 another Insurance these are all
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:24.030 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:46:24.030 --> 02:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:46:31.469 --> 02:46:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
least this will be our last Senate
 
02:46:38.349 --> 02:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
bill of the session of this session we
 
02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have heard everything and then
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
we'll spend the next two weeks well I
 
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
think you'll enjoy this hearing so much
 
02:46:46.110 --> 02:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
that I think there's a little bit of
 
02:46:50.710 --> 02:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay so open up the public hearing on
 
02:46:57.030 --> 02:46:57.040 align:start position:0%

02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
additional pieces around family building
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
are necessary to maintain our

available there around building a family
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it is increasingly a core piece of
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
where people choose to live and build
 
02:48:28.429 --> 02:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
their lives in families I talk to every
 
02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
day the families that make up this
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%

their lives especially women who
 
02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
contribute so much to our state but
 
02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
frequently both parents experience much
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
anxiety about whether they can get
 
02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:47.160 align:start position:0%

02:49:01.469 --> 02:49:01.479 align:start position:0%
times both parents be at work these are
 
02:49:03.670 --> 02:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
people we want to support they are
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
people we say we value but we need to
 
02:49:07.309 --> 02:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that value through some
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
simple pieces this bill asks to expand
 
02:49:11.790 --> 02:49:11.800 align:start position:0%

with with these are highly personal
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
matters one might argue that in today's
 
02:49:26.110 --> 02:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
employment Market employees have a lot
 
02:49:28.150 --> 02:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
of negotiating power to address these

issues with their
 
02:49:33.030 --> 02:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
employers and yet we see that even today
 
02:49:35.070 --> 02:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
even in that employment Market these
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
issues are not being addressed our

still professionals negotiating parental
 
02:49:43.510 --> 02:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and accommodations can feel
 
02:49:45.150 --> 02:49:45.160 align:start position:0%
like talking to your employer about time
 
02:49:47.229 --> 02:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
away from your job when in fact you are
 
02:49:52.510 --> 02:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:54.309 --> 02:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
giving the our residen these simple
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
pieces will be small and continuing to
 
02:49:59.550 --> 02:49:59.560 align:start position:0%

or 40 years ago if this feels novel just
 
02:50:08.590 --> 02:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
talk to any employer out there they will
 
02:50:10.349 --> 02:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
tell you the workforce and healthc Care
 
02:50:12.269 --> 02:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
standards have changed and that our job

attached to the bill and it states a

very reasonable cost for these small
 
02:50:55.389 --> 02:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
pieces that can bring very large
 
02:50:59.070 --> 02:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
economic benefits to our state with that
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank

02:51:16.469 --> 02:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
would call Katherine Tucker next just
 
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:19.720 align:start position:0%

just asked him to do we'll call up
 
02:51:36.520 --> 02:51:42.150 align:start position:0%
just asked him to do we'll call up
Katherine

02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
Tucker and I hope you're not going to
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
take 10
 
02:51:49.790 --> 02:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:51.229 --> 02:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
turn turn your mic turn you have to put
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
the mic on there you
 
02:51:52.600 --> 02:51:55.630 align:start position:0%
the mic on there you
go

02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm red is good is good okay thank you
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine Tucker I live in
 
02:52:02.910 --> 02:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
lonia and I am also an attorney that
 
02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:05.560 align:start position:0%
practices out of Lowden and I just folks
 
02:52:07.990 --> 02:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
I picked up a copy of the bill off the
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
table and it had the wrong fiscal note
 
02:52:11.229 --> 02:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
attached so I just want to make sure
 
02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
everybody's working off the right
 
02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
phisical note because there is you know
 
02:52:17.429 --> 02:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
tremendous difference the one that I is
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:25.150 --> 02:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
418 so this bill has two pieces the
 
02:52:26.870 --> 02:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
first piece is the insurance piece and
 
02:52:29.070 --> 02:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
what this piece does is it provides
 
02:52:31.229 --> 02:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
coverage for people in New Hampshire in
 
02:52:33.710 --> 02:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
large group plant to have intrauterine
 
02:52:36.790 --> 02:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
insemination procedures done IUI is a
 
02:52:38.750 --> 02:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
procedure where sperm is placed into the
 
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
uterus with the goal that the sperm
 
02:52:42.670 --> 02:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
makes its way to where it needs to be to
 
02:52:44.429 --> 02:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
the egg and and everything happens so
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
forth this has a much higher success
 
02:52:47.910 --> 02:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
rate than putting the sperm in the
 
02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
vagina because the sperm is much closer
 
02:52:52.750 --> 02:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
to where it eventually needs to go so
 
02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
this procedure is is a very low Tech
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
small procedure that is a tiny piece out
 
02:53:00.309 --> 02:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
of what the cost study looked at last
 
02:53:02.110 --> 02:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
year you remember we talked about a cost
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
Study last year that was extremely broad
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is one tiny low Tech piece of that
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
this procedure because it requires a
 
02:53:11.469 --> 02:53:11.479 align:start position:0%
uterus is only going to help those
 
02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
people who have a uterus so specifically
 
02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
the groups that are going to be helped
 
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
are female couples and single women who
 
02:53:20.389 --> 02:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
have not only a uterus but who have a
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
fallopian tube and an ovary in order to
 
02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
make this work intrauterine insemination
 
02:53:27.750 --> 02:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
IUI is the firstline medical treatment
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
for these two groups of people bottom
 
02:53:32.030 --> 02:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
line is these people need help they need
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
medical help to get pregnant and they
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
need donor sperm and the donor sperm has
 
02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
to find its way to the egg so the piece
 
02:53:41.469 --> 02:53:41.479 align:start position:0%
of getting donor sperm is not covered we
 
02:53:43.269 --> 02:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
are not asking the insurers to pay for
 
02:53:45.269 --> 02:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
any of that a lot of that can include
 
02:53:48.110 --> 02:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
non-medical costs that is not that
 
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
nothing is changing with that th that's
 
02:53:52.429 --> 02:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
going to be out of pocket self-pay all
 
02:53:54.510 --> 02:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
the time what we're asking for payment
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
for is the placement of that sperm into
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's uterus and that is a low Tech
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
medical procedure it doesn't involve IVF
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't involve surrogacy none of
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
those expensive things egg retrievals
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
any of that stuff is not involved it's a
 
02:54:10.190 --> 02:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
very low Tech simple procedure and it's
 
02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
a procedure that is recognized by the uh
 
02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
American Society for Reproductive
 
02:54:17.389 --> 02:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
Medicine as medically necessary for
 
02:54:19.790 --> 02:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
these folks I'll pass around um
 
02:54:22.469 --> 02:54:22.479 align:start position:0%
something in a moment but what the what
 
02:54:24.710 --> 02:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
happened in 2023 is that the American
 
02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
Society for Reproductive Medicine
 
02:54:29.349 --> 02:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
changed its medical guidelines and said
 
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know what infertility does include
 
02:54:33.510 --> 02:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
those folks that need medical
 
02:54:35.710 --> 02:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
intervention including but not limited
 
02:54:38.309 --> 02:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
to the use use of donor gamits in order
 
02:54:40.469 --> 02:54:40.479 align:start position:0%
to achieve a successful pregnancy either
 
02:54:42.990 --> 02:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
as an individual or a partner so we now
 
02:54:44.309 --> 02:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
are in a position where the leading
 
02:54:46.349 --> 02:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
medical Authority considers this
 
02:54:49.110 --> 02:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
treatment medically necessary for female
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
couples and single women and the reason
 
02:54:53.550 --> 02:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
that we're saying six Cycles is because
 
02:54:55.389 --> 02:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
that's the medically defined limit
 
02:54:56.750 --> 02:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what doctors are
 
02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to recommend six cycles of intun
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
and insemination if you're not pregnant
 
02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of six we need to rethink
 
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
things and and see if there's a problem
 
02:55:06.910 --> 02:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
going on here like I said it's very low
 
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
Tech it's inexpensive it's something
 
02:55:11.229 --> 02:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
that can be done by a doctor a nurse a
 
02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner a phys physicians
 
02:55:15.229 --> 02:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
assistant it's not something that people
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
are doing at home though um and I just
 
02:55:18.630 --> 02:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to address address a
 
02:55:20.590 --> 02:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
misconception that I had heard I had
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
heard that this bill might help male
 
02:55:25.510 --> 02:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
couples too because it it gives them the
 
02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
option to have an insemination done on
 
02:55:29.389 --> 02:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
their surrogate and I just want to say
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
that that to inseminate your surrogate
 
02:55:33.870 --> 02:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's traditional surrogacy we don't
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
like that we don't favor that at all not
 
02:55:37.790 --> 02:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
in our law or our practice there it's
 
02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
not illegal but it's essentially a
 
02:55:41.950 --> 02:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
co-parenting arrangement with your
 
02:55:45.229 --> 02:55:45.239 align:start position:0%
surgant so there's no doctor or or
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
lawyer that's ever going to recommend
 
02:55:49.070 --> 02:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
that as a good thing so this is a bill
 
02:55:52.030 --> 02:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
that helps specifically single women and
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
female couples and right now these are
 
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
folks that are paying out of pocket for
 
02:55:58.030 --> 02:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
that medical treatment so not only do
 
02:55:59.790 --> 02:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
they have all these expenses from
 
02:56:01.469 --> 02:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
getting the sperm that they have to pay
 
02:56:03.389 --> 02:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
out of pocket they also have to pay for
 
02:56:05.870 --> 02:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
this intrauterine insemination procedure
 
02:56:08.269 --> 02:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
out of pocket when their colleagues who
 
02:56:10.269 --> 02:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
need that same procedure their straight
 
02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
partnered colleagues don't have to pay
 
02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
for that procedure so it it just it
 
02:56:17.710 --> 02:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have this um this
 
02:56:20.150 --> 02:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
particular piece covered now the second
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
part of the bill talks about employment
 
02:56:23.990 --> 02:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
leave and I just want to mention that
 
02:56:25.469 --> 02:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
when a person is going through fertility
 
02:56:27.469 --> 02:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
treatments particularly the female
 
02:56:29.309 --> 02:56:29.319 align:start position:0%
partner there's going to be a whole lot
 
02:56:31.269 --> 02:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
of appointments most of these
 
02:56:33.150 --> 02:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
appointments are routine quick in and
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
out for example an intrauterine
 
02:56:37.469 --> 02:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
insemination you get go to the doctor 15
 
02:56:40.070 --> 02:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
minutes you go home you go back to work
 
02:56:41.790 --> 02:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
um there's occasionally a longer
 
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
appointment um such as for an embryo
 
02:56:46.830 --> 02:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
transfer or if a person needs to have
 
02:56:49.070 --> 02:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
surgery but primarily these appointments
 
02:56:51.070 --> 02:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
are quick in and out and doctors will
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
schedule them during the lunch hour or
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
during early morning hours to help
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:02.590 --> 02:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
work so how much does it cost I
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
understand that it's a 5 cents no no
 
02:57:06.269 --> 02:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's not the number I'm
 
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
interested in how much how much are
 
02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
these people who are doing it now out of
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
pocket how much are they spending
 
02:57:15.550 --> 02:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars and I've got some
 
02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
folks here that are going to test
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars yes then how can it
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
only be 144 for the whole state because
 
02:57:24.229 --> 02:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
we are not Co there's no coverage for
 
02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
the part of getting the sperm the only
 
02:57:28.150 --> 02:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
coverage will be for placing the sperm
 
02:57:30.030 --> 02:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
into the uterus so the thousands of
 
02:57:32.269 --> 02:57:32.279 align:start position:0%
dollars includes getting the sperm yes
 
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
so what this covers how much does this
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
cost a few hundred a few
 
02:57:42.030 --> 02:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
hundred I believe the insurance
 
02:57:43.510 --> 02:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
department has those numbers they don't
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
have that's why I went over there she
 
02:57:46.510 --> 02:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
has it
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
now so that's what I went over to ask
 
02:57:51.790 --> 02:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
okay so so it's it that's that the
 
02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
actual the getting the sperm can be very
 
02:57:56.830 --> 02:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
expensive that's still the person still
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
has to pay for that yes you you won't be
 
02:58:01.870 --> 02:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
back for that bill next year
 
02:58:05.349 --> 02:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
no we got YouTube
 
02:58:08.710 --> 02:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
now not next year oh well excuse me
 
02:58:10.750 --> 02:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
you'll never be back for
 
02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
that for for the stuff that has to do
 
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
with the sperm bank and the compensation
 
02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
to the donor the travel costs for the
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
donor the legal cost for the donor no
 
02:58:20.070 --> 02:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to ask for that in the
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
future okay okay so uh represent Ammon
 
02:58:26.190 --> 02:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:58:27.349 --> 02:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and your
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
explanation I just want to make sure I I
 
02:58:30.670 --> 02:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
understand the two parts of the bill so
 
02:58:33.590 --> 02:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
the first part is the interuterine
 
02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
insemination and that's a very specific
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
procedure that insurance would have to
 
02:58:40.590 --> 02:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
cover yes the second part has to do with
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
leave and the leave the reasons for the
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
leave could are much broader right it's
 
02:58:46.990 --> 02:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
not just for that procedure yes it could
 
02:58:49.309 --> 02:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
also be for any other infertility
 
02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
treatment yes that's correct and and
 
02:58:53.309 --> 02:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
just a followup for the question M
 
02:58:55.110 --> 02:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
inquire So reading the fiscal note it
 
02:58:58.790 --> 02:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
talks about uh it's potentially it could
 
02:59:00.750 --> 02:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
potentially add a burden on
 
02:59:03.229 --> 02:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties because they
 
02:59:05.630 --> 02:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
have uh employment contracts that are
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
already existing and they may not have
 
02:59:10.830 --> 02:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
very many employees uh so they couldn't
 
02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
afford to lose one for a couple of weeks
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
um is that your understanding that uh
 
02:59:19.269 --> 02:59:19.279 align:start position:0%
this could potentially be a mandate on
 
02:59:21.790 --> 02:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh and their Workforce
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes but a couple of weeks that would be
 
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
a highly unusual situation that would be
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
a significant surgery just like any
 
02:59:30.910 --> 02:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
other surgery if we're talking about the
 
02:59:33.469 --> 02:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
treatment the normal the standard
 
02:59:35.630 --> 02:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
treatments th those are not going to be
 
02:59:37.630 --> 02:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
two week long procedures it's going to
 
02:59:39.950 --> 02:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
be a one-day office visit you're back to
 
02:59:41.630 --> 02:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
work the very next day yeah so why do we
 
02:59:43.790 --> 02:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
have all the stuff in here then why is
 
02:59:46.469 --> 02:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
why is that here if it's just a it's
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
just an office visit why I cuz this I
 
02:59:51.630 --> 02:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
when I was reading I was thinking it was
 
02:59:54.309 --> 02:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
lifting from our statute and that which
 
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
is that an employer can't fire of
 
02:59:58.990 --> 02:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
someone who's out on on pregnancy leave
 
03:00:01.269 --> 03:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
yes okay so is that what this is trying
 
03:00:04.510 --> 03:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
to recreate here because that wouldn't
 
03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't matter that statue doesn't ask
 
03:00:09.150 --> 03:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
how you got pregnant it clarify that
 
03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
we're not including just that when
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're actually Pregnant part but the
 
03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get pregnant right but you
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
just said it's an it's an office of
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
visit yes one day office
 
03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
visit but so you go to work in the
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
morning you go to your office visit at
 
03:00:24.830 --> 03:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
lunch and then you go back to work would
 
03:00:27.870 --> 03:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
be a quick office visit a longer office
 
03:00:30.389 --> 03:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
visit is you take the whole day off from
 
03:00:34.349 --> 03:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
work again I if that's just one day why
 
03:00:36.110 --> 03:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
we have all this in here what why do we
 
03:00:38.269 --> 03:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
need to put all that in here well we
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that people are
 
03:00:40.830 --> 03:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
protected when they take that one day
 
03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
off or take that off that they could get
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
fired for that one day we want to make
 
03:00:48.110 --> 03:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
sure that doesn't happen
 
03:00:49.830 --> 03:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:57.550 --> 03:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
Pier the the actual
 
03:01:02.070 --> 03:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
procedure of inserting the sperm which
 
03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
is what we're covering which is what
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but usually these
 
03:01:09.670 --> 03:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
procedures usually uh there's there's
 
03:01:11.550 --> 03:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
talks about medication there's talks
 
03:01:14.030 --> 03:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
about doctors monitoring blood and all
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
this other kind of stuff we're not
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
talking about adding any of that
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that that would be a
 
03:01:22.229 --> 03:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
case-by case decision made by The
 
03:01:23.790 --> 03:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
Physician as to whether that person
 
03:01:25.870 --> 03:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
needs medication now in terms of
 
03:01:27.830 --> 03:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring yes you do have to put the
 
03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
sperm into the uterus at the right point
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
in the woman's cycle so there's a lot of
 
03:01:36.269 --> 03:01:36.279 align:start position:0%
inexpensive monitoring um supplies
 
03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
things that can be done at home that
 
03:01:39.389 --> 03:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
people would just buy over the counter
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
and monitor themselves at home and then
 
03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
go into the office when their uh test
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
kits are indicating they need to be
 
03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:49.550 align:start position:0%
kits are indicating they need to be
inseminated

03:01:49.550 --> 03:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
inseminated
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
aren't you discriminating against gay
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
bill

03:01:58.309 --> 03:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
um yes but this is a step in the right
 
03:02:02.030 --> 03:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
direction and I think it's a very
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
important step female couples are in
 
03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
this unique position of they can get
 
03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
pregnant but they got to spend a whole
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
lot of money out of pocket in order to
 
03:02:11.429 --> 03:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
make that happen if we can protect this
 
03:02:13.550 --> 03:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
segment of of individuals I think that
 
03:02:15.469 --> 03:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
is a giant step in the right direction I
 
03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
know David Crosby is not alive anymore
 
03:02:19.309 --> 03:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
but I've heard of someone just goes get
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
gets a guy and helps them out with that
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
anything I'm not following what you're
 
03:02:30.750 --> 03:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
say I'm sorry I don't know Mr you don't
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
03:02:37.630 --> 03:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:40.830 --> 03:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
testimony you have a question for her do
 
03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
you take one more question I'm sorry
 
03:02:45.229 --> 03:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
would you take another question okay
 
03:02:48.429 --> 03:02:48.439 align:start position:0%
represent M thank you Mr chairman
 
03:02:53.070 --> 03:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
chart why should the try it
 
03:03:00.190 --> 03:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
home be 12 months and not six months um
 
03:03:01.710 --> 03:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
so when you're trying at home what you
 
03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're doing is you're placing sperm
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
into the vagina whether you're doing it
 
03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
through sexual activity or whether
 
03:03:08.110 --> 03:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
you're using a syringe and putting the
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
sperm into the vagina it goes into the
 
03:03:12.670 --> 03:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
vagina right by the cervix and then the
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
sperm has to make its way all the way
 
03:03:15.870 --> 03:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
through the cervix and into the uterus
 
03:03:17.990 --> 03:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
and up the Fallopian tubes so there's a
 
03:03:19.710 --> 03:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
lot more that the sperm has got to do on
 
03:03:21.790 --> 03:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
its own and therefore the success rates
 
03:03:23.830 --> 03:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
are a lot lower we're talking probably
 
03:03:27.150 --> 03:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
5% success rate per month versus 15 to
 
03:03:33.389 --> 03:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:36.349 --> 03:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
uterus swim swim swim okay but shouldn't
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
it be six months the same as six
 
03:03:41.150 --> 03:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
rounds as far
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
as as far as how long the waiting period
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
is for both for both columns both both
 
03:03:49.150 --> 03:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
situations both living or life
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
situations so if you're putting so it's
 
03:03:53.070 --> 03:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
there so there's parity yep so if you
 
03:03:54.990 --> 03:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
put the sperm into the vagina no I got
 
03:03:56.990 --> 03:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
all that part I got that part I don't
 
03:03:58.670 --> 03:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
think any of us need that lesson I hope
 
03:04:03.070 --> 03:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
not both columns right both both types
 
03:04:06.670 --> 03:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
of living situations here one six rounds
 
03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
assuming that's one round a month versus
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
six months before that insurance
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
coverage K kicks in shouldn't there be
 
03:04:17.790 --> 03:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it both both time periods be
 
03:04:19.469 --> 03:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
six months that's all I'm asking that's
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
intentionally set at different time
 
03:04:23.910 --> 03:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
frames and the reason because when the
 
03:04:27.190 --> 03:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
lower success rate with the intra
 
03:04:30.349 --> 03:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
vaginal or intracervical insemination is
 
03:04:33.030 --> 03:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
means that you try more times before you
 
03:04:35.630 --> 03:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
say this isn't working versus if you put
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
the sperm into the uterus you only have
 
03:04:40.229 --> 03:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
to try six times before you can assess
 
03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
whether this is not working so there's
 
03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
medically defined different standards
 
03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at the what the
 
03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
doctors say if the procedure you're
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
doing is an IUI 6 months is the
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate time to try that
 
03:04:55.389 --> 03:04:55.399 align:start position:0%
before we say hey wait a second here
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
there might be something else wrong that
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
we need to examine so if we wanted to
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
pick if we wanted to make give parody on
 
03:05:05.870 --> 03:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
the timeline we could either change that
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
to six months or we could make
 
03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
this three rounds or six months or six
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
rounds or 12 months whichever is greater
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
or something like that if we want to do
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
establish parity and timing based on the
 
03:05:21.870 --> 03:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
medical evidence if you wanted to do
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
that this will be in the subcommittee
 
03:05:26.670 --> 03:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
and just one comment if I could there is
 
03:05:30.349 --> 03:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
a 12month ICI on the leftand
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
side that's current talking what the
 
03:05:35.040 --> 03:05:36.630 align:start position:0%
side that's current talking what the
bill

03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you very much chair we
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
call on Michelle Heaton from the New
 
03:05:52.269 --> 03:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.190 --> 03:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
hello Michelle Heaton I'm the director
 
03:05:55.110 --> 03:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
of life and health with the New
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department um just
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
level set we are neutral on this bill we
 
03:06:02.790 --> 03:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
are not taking a position it is a policy
 
03:06:04.990 --> 03:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
decision for the policy makers to make
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
what benefits you want to mandate to
 
03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
give a little background we do already
 
03:06:11.710 --> 03:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
have a fertility mandate for the large
 
03:06:14.190 --> 03:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
group market and that covers all
 
03:06:16.990 --> 03:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
medically necessary fertility treatment
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
what this new mandate would do is
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
outside of what is medically
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
necessary and it would require that
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
insurers cover up to six rounds of IUI
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
um in a plan
 
03:06:32.710 --> 03:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
year and to get to your questions
 
03:06:37.469 --> 03:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
representative hunt um last year in our
 
03:06:41.309 --> 03:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
claims data we observed 499 distinct
 
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
claims for this specific procedure the
 
03:06:49.950 --> 03:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
we um assumed in the calculations of our
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note which we had the whole
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
worksheet filled out and OLS condensed
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
it down so a lot of that got cut out um
 
03:07:02.510 --> 03:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
but we assumed an upper limit of an
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
increase in claims of a
 
03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
increase in claims of a
1,125

03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
1,125
 
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
claims um so that would be a little bit
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
more than double the number of claims
 
03:07:12.950 --> 03:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
right now to give a little bit more
 
03:07:15.630 --> 03:07:15.640 align:start position:0%
background there was a bill about um
 
03:07:19.229 --> 03:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
expanding access to f Services last
 
03:07:21.790 --> 03:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
session that we did a mandate study on
 
03:07:24.670 --> 03:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
over the summer that was a much broader
 
03:07:26.190 --> 03:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
mandate study and some of our
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
assumptions are based on some of the
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
stuff in that report but this is a very
 
03:07:33.070 --> 03:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
much more narrow um mandate so it's
 
03:07:36.110 --> 03:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
essentially requiring that insurers
 
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
cover six rounds of the IUI procedure it
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
does not mandate coverage of any
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
medications or testing that may be
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
necessary or appropriate um for this
 
03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
procedure I'm happy to answer any
 
03:07:55.389 --> 03:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:58.750 --> 03:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
much y oh do have questions oh all right
 
03:08:00.150 --> 03:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative walls first and then
 
03:08:00.160 --> 03:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
representative walls first and then
representative

03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:08:05.510 --> 03:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
spear thank you Mr chairman uh I'm just
 
03:08:08.070 --> 03:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the verbiage in this bill uh
 
03:08:10.229 --> 03:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
does the insurance industry see a
 
03:08:13.229 --> 03:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
difference between IVF and
 
03:08:16.990 --> 03:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
IUI because it I see that's both are
 
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
stated like an act it says during IVF
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
treatments should it be amended to say
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
fertility um treatments oh are you
 
03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
looking at the description above yeah
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
the description right um I think that's
 
03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
so this bill has been amended we have
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
been working on this for several months
 
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
so I think that may have been the
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
initial intent of the bill what the
 
03:08:43.469 --> 03:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
language is that was landed on was just
 
03:08:46.550 --> 03:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
IUI so I'm not a doctor but I know a
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
little bit based on this bill and IUI is
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
a specific procedure that was just being
 
03:08:56.429 --> 03:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
described to us IVF is um just asking
 
03:08:58.990 --> 03:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage wise I'm not asking
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
for the det okay so I already know the
 
03:09:02.910 --> 03:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
details currently under insurance
 
03:09:05.710 --> 03:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
coverage if you have a diagnosis of
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
infertility all of the different array
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
of services that may be necessary are
 
03:09:14.550 --> 03:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
covered okay what this does is it
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
provides it makes this specific service
 
03:09:20.190 --> 03:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
available without having to have that
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of
 
03:09:25.950 --> 03:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much oh there
 
03:09:30.990 --> 03:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
represent spear yes
 
03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:32.790 align:start position:0%
represent spear yes
sorry

03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
I we just were handed a definition of
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
infertility and you had made the comment
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
that uh there's a it doesn't have a
 
03:09:44.670 --> 03:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
medical necessity but based on the
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
definition we were just handed it is a
 
03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:47.910 align:start position:0%
definition we were just handed it is a
medical

03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessity so did you hand this out I did
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
not I believe that is a policy statement
 
03:09:59.429 --> 03:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
from an uh specific group I would not
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
consider that to be the accepted medical
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
necessity and that is not in line with
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
the way our statutes dep we have a
 
03:10:09.910 --> 03:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
definition someplace in yes we do can we
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
see it can you tell us yeah we in the
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
old days we used to be fighting over the
 
03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
language for every session where do we
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
find it in20 J three the definition sry
 
03:10:23.229 --> 03:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
would you go go a little slower 420j
 
03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's the magic that's the magic R1 J
 
03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
4202020 colon 3 is the definition
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
section for Managed Care thank you and I
 
03:10:35.469 --> 03:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly the Roman numeral but
 
03:10:37.229 --> 03:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
there medical that'll keep you busy all
 
03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.870 --> 03:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
chapter but when that list where I send
 
03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
out all the mandates they're all for2 Js
 
03:10:47.479 --> 03:10:48.469 align:start position:0%
out all the mandates they're all for2 Js
oh

03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay okay this specific one is its own
 
03:10:53.309 --> 03:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
chapter though specific to fertility the
 
03:10:56.429 --> 03:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
fertility is a separate but 420j is
 
03:10:59.590 --> 03:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
where you want to where you want to stop
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
shopping okay thank you very
 
03:11:25.469 --> 03:11:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:28.710 --> 03:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon uh Mr
 
03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee uh
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Heidi croll I
 
03:11:33.990 --> 03:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
work at Gallagher cahan and Grell and
 
03:11:35.790 --> 03:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here today representing ahip
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
um before I forget to mention it I will
 
03:11:45.269 --> 03:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
also say that there is um the medically
 
03:11:49.309 --> 03:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
necessary um language is also reflected
 
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
um and this was a deliberate decision
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
that we made when we were working with
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders a number of years years
 
03:11:56.670 --> 03:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
ago when we put the fertility statute on
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
the books you know as a brand new
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
statute so it is also in
 
03:12:02.439 --> 03:12:04.389 align:start position:0%
statute so it is also in
4177

03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
4177
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
dasg colon um one under the definition
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
sections uh it's it's uh Roman six under
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
the definitions um you'll find that the
 
03:12:17.150 --> 03:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
same definition of medically necess
 
03:12:21.550 --> 03:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
Neary um we put that there as well so
 
03:12:24.150 --> 03:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
um so first I just wanted to say that we
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
truly appreciate um the time and the
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
willingness of the Prime sponsor and The
 
03:12:30.229 --> 03:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
Advocates the insurance department and
 
03:12:33.070 --> 03:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
other legislators and Senate staff uh
 
03:12:35.630 --> 03:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
everyone um put a lot of um time and
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
effort into this bill uh so it's been a
 
03:12:40.349 --> 03:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
very good um stakeholder process lots of
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
meetings and phone calls and many many
 
03:12:44.670 --> 03:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
drafts um so the communication around
 
03:12:46.750 --> 03:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
this bill was very good um and we really
 
03:12:50.030 --> 03:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate apprciate that um the issues
 
03:12:51.950 --> 03:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
around this bill are complicated as you
 
03:12:53.790 --> 03:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
may recall from um looking at similar
 
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislation last year um including how
 
03:12:58.750 --> 03:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
to balance um compliance with medical
 
03:13:01.590 --> 03:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
necessity law um our anti-discrimination
 
03:13:03.750 --> 03:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
laws and then of course the cost impacts
 
03:13:05.710 --> 03:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
of of this mandate or really any new
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
mandate um we do appreciate that the
 
03:13:10.510 --> 03:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill has been substantially narrowed
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
from its as introduced version um we do
 
03:13:15.150 --> 03:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
think it's a better structure uh
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
compared to the prior drafts um that the
 
03:13:20.070 --> 03:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were considering um and is
 
03:13:22.510 --> 03:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
certainly more straightforward and um
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
certainly easier to understand what the
 
03:13:28.110 --> 03:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
new mandate would be um as you might
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
imagine we do still remain concerned uh
 
03:13:32.590 --> 03:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
you know about language that talks about
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
coverage you know regardless of whether
 
03:13:36.990 --> 03:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
or not the individual has a diagnosis of
 
03:13:39.429 --> 03:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
infertility um so this is really getting
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
at the heart of medical necessity as you
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
know is a Cornerstone of Managed Care um
 
03:13:46.710 --> 03:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
it ensures that um people are getting
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
appro quality care and that we're
 
03:13:51.389 --> 03:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
watching out for um the costs that are
 
03:13:53.830 --> 03:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
being borne by the premium payers and by
 
03:13:56.910 --> 03:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
the patients themselves um so this
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
language you know obviously circumvents
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
medical necessity and that's just always
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to be a concern um for for the
 
03:14:06.910 --> 03:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
carriers um and it's concerning really
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
because it opens the door um to
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
potential future mandates that also
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
might seek an exemption for medical
 
03:14:14.590 --> 03:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
necessity and of course that could
 
03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
really be a slippery slope and and a a
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
costly one as well
 
03:14:22.349 --> 03:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
um as you know the costs of new mandates
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
are always a concern for us um I am
 
03:14:25.990 --> 03:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
aware that the Bill's fiscal note
 
03:14:28.269 --> 03:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
estimates the cost at 5 cents um per
 
03:14:30.469 --> 03:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
member per month so that is certainly
 
03:14:32.590 --> 03:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
lower um than some of the estimates that
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
were associated with prior drafts um so
 
03:14:38.670 --> 03:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
that reduction is is very good to see
 
03:14:41.710 --> 03:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
um uh however you know obviously this is
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
a brand new mandate um both here in New
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and really across the country
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
um as um the prior speaker was
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
mentioning there was a change at the um
 
03:14:53.750 --> 03:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
by this Association back in late fall
 
03:14:55.870 --> 03:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
October or November so you know it's
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
really just been in the last six months
 
03:15:00.190 --> 03:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
or so that a handful of states are
 
03:15:02.750 --> 03:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
moving in this direction um and so you
 
03:15:04.870 --> 03:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
know part of what carriers are grappling
 
03:15:06.910 --> 03:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
with is that there's not really um a
 
03:15:09.150 --> 03:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
good handle anywhere um we can't really
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
look to other states to get a good
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
handle and what the actual cost will be
 
03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
or how they might grow over time um and
 
03:15:17.950 --> 03:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
of course this is one probably a number
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
of mandates that will pass or might
 
03:15:22.990 --> 03:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
might pass um this session so we just
 
03:15:24.990 --> 03:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
we're always cognizant of the fact that
 
03:15:27.550 --> 03:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
um these things do add up um and of
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
course costs go up over time so um with
 
03:15:34.110 --> 03:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
03:15:36.389 --> 03:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
questions I did want to mention and I'm
 
03:15:38.229 --> 03:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
sorry that this did not come to my
 
03:15:40.710 --> 03:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
attention um earlier when this bill was
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the Senate um but the effective date
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
is um 60 days after passage um I
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
don't have any position on the second
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um around the
 
03:15:54.110 --> 03:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
employment piece so I don't know what
 
03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense for an effective date there
 
03:15:58.830 --> 03:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
but um at least for the the Mandate the
 
03:16:00.670 --> 03:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
insurance mandate portion of the bill if
 
03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
the um if you are inclined to move
 
03:16:05.150 --> 03:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
forward this we would respectfully
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
request a an effective date of January
 
03:16:10.189 --> 03:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
1st of 2025 so my apologies for not
 
03:16:12.950 --> 03:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
picking that up um when this bill was in
 
03:16:12.960 --> 03:16:14.990 align:start position:0%
picking that up um when this bill was in
the

03:16:14.990 --> 03:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
Senate okay any questions from the
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
committee members see none oh we do have
 
03:16:22.030 --> 03:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
a question representative pelli thank
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
you quick question so what segment what
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
insurance segment would this pertain to
 
03:16:29.830 --> 03:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
if we look at the pie chart sure yes
 
03:16:31.710 --> 03:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so this um
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
our current law around fertility
 
03:16:34.950 --> 03:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
treatments and this one would be
 
03:16:38.429 --> 03:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
consistent with it only targets the um
 
03:16:42.670 --> 03:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
employer fully insured Market um so my
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
recollection is that that number
 
03:16:47.189 --> 03:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 21% of the market so it
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't Target the individual market
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
fully insured um and it doesn't target
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
self-funded market or Medicaid or
 
03:16:57.950 --> 03:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare or any of those other forms of
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
coverage so it's um exclusively employer
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
sponsored fully insured market and yeah
 
03:17:09.590 --> 03:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
number okay thank you thank you all
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
right I have uh
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
four more cards here everybody's in
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
support so all I can say is please don't
 
03:17:24.030 --> 03:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
repeat what the last person said and
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:36.590 --> 03:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
craft hello my name is Faith craft and
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here testifying in support of SB 558
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um so I am in a same-sex relationship my
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
wife and I just got married 6 months ago
 
03:17:48.950 --> 03:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and so we are starting the Journey of
 
03:17:51.870 --> 03:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
Parenthood and so the comparison of
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
Parenthood for same-sex couple for women
 
03:17:56.590 --> 03:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
versus heterosexual couple there's a lot
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
more Hoops to jump through a lot more
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
costs so right now because I am in a
 
03:18:04.269 --> 03:18:04.279 align:start position:0%
place where I'm unemployed I could begin
 
03:18:05.830 --> 03:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
this journey of wanting to become a
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
parent and know that I can take this
 
03:18:11.189 --> 03:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
time off maybe incur the costs that come
 
03:18:14.590 --> 03:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
with buying the sperm storing shipping
 
03:18:17.550 --> 03:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
and then IUI or I could get a new job
 
03:18:20.349 --> 03:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
and then hope that I can have that paid
 
03:18:23.429 --> 03:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
parental leave to one become a parent
 
03:18:25.550 --> 03:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
but even leading up to it taking all
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
this time off needed to uh have IUI for
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
the Journey of Parenthood as Katherine
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned IUI um it's recommended for
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
six Cycles with each cycle of IUI there
 
03:18:41.910 --> 03:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
is a lot of appointments that come with
 
03:18:44.030 --> 03:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
that because there's the pre-testing
 
03:18:46.269 --> 03:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
there's um genetic testing to make sure
 
03:18:48.510 --> 03:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
the sperm that you're using isn't going
 
03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
to have um some genetic um issue um
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
making sure you're not a recessive
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
carrier for something there's blood
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
tests there's a lot of appointments
 
03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
leading up to the point of IUI which
 
03:19:03.269 --> 03:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
fine if that's not covered by insurance
 
03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
but then IUI if you're doing six rounds
 
03:19:08.630 --> 03:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
of it that's maybe 6 months if not
 
03:19:11.710 --> 03:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
longer and so leading up to that you
 
03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
need to uh purchase three to five vials
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
of sperm from a sperm bank and my wife
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
and I we've been looking at the cost
 
03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
that can be upwards of $10,000 for the
 
03:19:26.229 --> 03:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
sperm for the shipping for the storage
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
um just to get it to the doctor's office
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
so there are grants available to cover
 
03:19:34.110 --> 03:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
that right now but a lot of them state
 
03:19:37.550 --> 03:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
that you need to be someone with a prior
 
03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
medical condition and it's not deemed
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
medically necessary for a same-sex
 
03:19:46.110 --> 03:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
couple so my wife and I I would be the
 
03:19:50.229 --> 03:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
one that would carry and we are in the
 
03:19:52.830 --> 03:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
preconception part of getting ready for
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
Parenthood where we would meet with our
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
OBGYN and she has to do all this testing
 
03:20:00.510 --> 03:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I am um in a good
 
03:20:02.590 --> 03:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
place to potentially start the process
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
to become pregnant and a a heterosexual
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
couple they don't have to do all this
 
03:20:09.630 --> 03:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
pre-testing or pay out of pocket for
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
sperm or anything and so we are looking
 
03:20:16.269 --> 03:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
at incurring a very large um price to
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
become parent and it's not a guarantee
 
03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
that I would get pregnant off of the
 
03:20:23.790 --> 03:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
first vial of sperm um my wife and I
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
joined this queer conception group where
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard stories of um same-sex
 
03:20:31.950 --> 03:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
couples it's taking them years to become
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
pregnant um so there's no guarantee that
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
off the first vial I would become
 
03:20:40.550 --> 03:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
pregnant um if it's years of a process
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money and also ensuring
 
03:20:47.309 --> 03:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
with an employer if I am am trying to
 
03:20:49.710 --> 03:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
become pregnant and it takes years to
 
03:20:51.790 --> 03:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
become pregnant there's no guarantee
 
03:20:54.349 --> 03:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
currently that the employer would allow
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
me to keep going to these appointments
 
03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
to become a parent um so that's again
 
03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
another hurdle to becoming a parent and
 
03:21:04.110 --> 03:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's not fair there's another
 
03:21:07.269 --> 03:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
restriction I guess to becoming a parent
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
and so for me I have ultimately wanted
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
to become a mom and I see all of my uh
 
03:21:15.870 --> 03:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
heterosexual friends who are able to you
 
03:21:17.790 --> 03:21:17.800 align:start position:0%
know they have sex great they become
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
pregnant um but the difference between
 
03:21:25.710 --> 03:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
um IUI and IVF big difference um doctors
 
03:21:28.670 --> 03:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
need to do this procedure because they
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
can track to make sure that um the sperm
 
03:21:33.950 --> 03:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
is being properly placed in the uterus
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
um if you're doing this at home you're
 
03:21:37.469 --> 03:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
not properly storing the sperm it could
 
03:21:39.510 --> 03:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
go to waste you're wasting a ton of
 
03:21:41.469 --> 03:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
money and so it's really important that
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
you have the medical necessity from a
 
03:21:46.189 --> 03:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
doctor that states that you are able to
 
03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
have the cost covered by insurance but
 
03:21:50.189 --> 03:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
then also have them tracking the
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
procedures that are happening
 
03:21:55.189 --> 03:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
so again it is very expensive and a
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
lengthy process and so for me to become
 
03:22:00.510 --> 03:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
a mom this is very paral to me and I
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
would like to know that I don't have to
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
spend $10,000 plus whatever the cost of
 
03:22:08.110 --> 03:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
all these medical appointments are going
 
03:22:11.710 --> 03:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
to be um so again this is a medical
 
03:22:15.309 --> 03:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
necessity for me as a same-sex uh couple
 
03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
I know it's not for heterosexual couples
 
03:22:19.550 --> 03:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
but being able to know that the
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
insurance will cover this and that we
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to um fight with insurance
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
carriers before we even get to these
 
03:22:26.830 --> 03:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
appointments we want to know that we can
 
03:22:28.510 --> 03:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
go to the appointment is going to be
 
03:22:31.389 --> 03:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
covered and that we can hopefully become
 
03:22:33.910 --> 03:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
a parent within the first couple rounds
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting um 12 months and then
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
potentially having to do IVF which then
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
even that's not covered by Insurance um
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions I
 
03:22:47.429 --> 03:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
hope that covered it
 
03:22:47.439 --> 03:22:49.630 align:start position:0%
hope that covered it
representative

03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:53.110 --> 03:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
spear thank you I I missed something
 
03:22:55.750 --> 03:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
that you said because uh I got something
 
03:22:58.429 --> 03:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
a little confused so there's a lot of
 
03:23:00.750 --> 03:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that goes on before you ever get
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
into the office to actually have the IUI
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
procedure M and you said that that could
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
cost as much as $10,000 yes so that but
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the question oh sorry yep and
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
that there are grants available to help
 
03:23:16.750 --> 03:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
with that yes did I understand it
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
correctly that says those grants are
 
03:23:21.110 --> 03:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
limited if you don't have insurance for
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
the IUI part of it or did I
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstand something no those grants
 
03:23:28.990 --> 03:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
are limited to people that are already
 
03:23:30.750 --> 03:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
deemed like infertile or you have
 
03:23:32.710 --> 03:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
already a prior existing medical
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
condition it's not available for
 
03:23:37.349 --> 03:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
same-sex couples that are just trying to
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
um become pregnant so you have to pay
 
03:23:43.389 --> 03:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
the $10,000 equivalent already right and
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's not even the issue like whatever
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
we have to pay that but then on top of
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
of already paying $110,000 all those
 
03:23:50.030 --> 03:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
medical appointments will add up really
 
03:23:53.710 --> 03:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:57.309 --> 03:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you very much uh chair
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:23.189 --> 03:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
hi chairman members of the committee my
 
03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
name is Devin Quinn the director of
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
policy for the New Hampshire women's
 
03:24:28.110 --> 03:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
Foundation I actually wanted to read a
 
03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
letter um from an OBGYN who couldn't be
 
03:24:34.189 --> 03:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
here today if you'll allow that um this
 
03:24:36.750 --> 03:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
is from Dr Janet Perkins Howen uh dear
 
03:24:38.590 --> 03:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
esteemed legislators I'm writing to urge
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
your support for the inclusion of
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
medical coverage for INT intrauterine
 
03:24:45.550 --> 03:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
insemination for lesbian couples within
 
03:24:47.790 --> 03:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
our state's Healthcare policies I also
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
write as an OBGYN who has spent her
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
entire career in the great state of New
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire IUI is a vital assisted
 
03:24:56.590 --> 03:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
reproductive technology that enables
 
03:24:58.710 --> 03:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
many couples to conceive and start
 
03:25:01.309 --> 03:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
families however despite its proven
 
03:25:02.830 --> 03:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and importance in
 
03:25:05.790 --> 03:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
addressing infertility access to IUI
 
03:25:08.590 --> 03:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
remains limited for lesbian couples this
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
lack of access poses Financial burdens
 
03:25:13.070 --> 03:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
when seeking to build families once les
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
lesbian couples decide to start a family
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
IUI is phys physiologically necessary as
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
a first step every individual regardless
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
of sexual orientation should have access
 
03:25:24.910 --> 03:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
to the medically necessary treatments
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
and services they need to start a family
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
furthermore endorsing the coverage of
 
03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
IUI for lesbian couples aligns with our
 
03:25:33.030 --> 03:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
state's values of fairness compassion
 
03:25:35.070 --> 03:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
and support for families I urge your
 
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
consideration of this important issue
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
and to support legislative measures that
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
would clarify the medical necessity of
 
03:25:42.790 --> 03:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
IUI for lesbian couples your endorsement
 
03:25:44.269 --> 03:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
of this initiative would have a profound
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
and positive impact on the lives of many
 
03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
individuals and families in our state
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um for your attention to this
 
03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
matter Dr uh Janet Perkins
 
03:25:57.389 --> 03:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
howand great thank you very much if
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
there if I may there was one question
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
you asked um about the coverage issue or
 
03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
um the uh Municipal um impact um and I
 
03:26:09.349 --> 03:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to I guess sitting here are
 
03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
you saying do we really need to make
 
03:26:13.710 --> 03:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
sure that employers would let someone go
 
03:26:16.510 --> 03:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
to a fertility treatment appointment and
 
03:26:18.309 --> 03:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
you know that's actually why we have it
 
03:26:20.429 --> 03:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
already in the books for for prenatal
 
03:26:21.790 --> 03:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
appointments and you would might think
 
03:26:24.389 --> 03:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
the same thing wouldn't everyone allow
 
03:26:26.510 --> 03:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
people to attend prenatal appointments
 
03:26:28.030 --> 03:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately we do have to have
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
that in statute for the very you know
 
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
small number of employee employers that
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
may not understand the importance of
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
that and so um it mimicking that
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
prenatal appointments is also really
 
03:26:41.030 --> 03:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
important too and that's unpaid time um
 
03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's and as you heard it's quick
 
03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
appointments but maybe few appointments
 
03:26:47.790 --> 03:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
maybe many appointments but they're
 
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
quick and so we just want to make sure
 
03:26:51.630 --> 03:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
um especially if an employer doesn't
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand fertility treatments that
 
03:26:54.790 --> 03:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
they understand that they do need to
 
03:26:55.990 --> 03:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
make sure their employers can attend
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
those appointments if that
 
03:27:02.110 --> 03:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies thank
 
03:27:04.710 --> 03:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
you any other questions see none thank
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony chair
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon good afternoon um my
 
03:27:30.830 --> 03:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
name is Brianna HL and I am the legal
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
policy fellow at new Futures I'm my
 
03:27:35.710 --> 03:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
testimony focuses on the second part of
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
the bill which is the workplace
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
protection uh especially for postpartum
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
care um currently the US is in a
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality crisis with a lot of
 
03:27:46.910 --> 03:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths most mostly happening
 
03:27:48.910 --> 03:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
around postpartum care so it's important
 
03:27:50.910 --> 03:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
to have those workplace protections so
 
03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
people can go to doctor's appointments
 
03:27:56.910 --> 03:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
or and stay healthy without using all of
 
03:28:02.150 --> 03:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
their paid time off and needing care and
 
03:28:03.429 --> 03:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
I can answer any questions if there's
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
any what well because I know we have in
 
03:28:08.590 --> 03:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
our statue that we want to protect
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant women it doesn't say how you
 
03:28:14.750 --> 03:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
got pregnant there's no issue there so
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm surprised talking about
 
03:28:18.269 --> 03:28:18.279 align:start position:0%
postpartum because that's after the
 
03:28:20.910 --> 03:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
baby's been born and that we give the F
 
03:28:23.590 --> 03:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
we give you a woman right to stay home
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
and and that the we mandate the employer
 
03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
can't fire you it's got to take you back
 
03:28:30.189 --> 03:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
when you're done um postpartum death can
 
03:28:32.710 --> 03:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
happen up to a year after the pregnancy
 
03:28:35.469 --> 03:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
um and so that's more like more broader
 
03:28:38.710 --> 03:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
so oh so you're adding to the the length
 
03:28:43.269 --> 03:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
of time um no just for um postpartum
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
care in
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you any other questions from
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:28:56.110 --> 03:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
members see none got one card left
 
03:29:10.510 --> 03:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:12.269 --> 03:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah you already had to turn
 
03:29:14.110 --> 03:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
it on it has to be
 
03:29:18.910 --> 03:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
green good afternoon and thank you Mr
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
chairman we are here in support of
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
s558 my name is Lindsay Harrington this
 
03:29:29.070 --> 03:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
is my wife Natalie we reside in
 
03:29:30.990 --> 03:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
conquer a few months before we got
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
married in 2020 we began the truly
 
03:29:35.830 --> 03:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
romantic task of deciding if it made
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
sense to be on the same insurance
 
03:29:40.750 --> 03:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
policy working for larger nonprofits we
 
03:29:42.630 --> 03:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
both had reasonably affordable premiums
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
the main difference was that Natalie had
 
03:29:48.349 --> 03:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:49.870 --> 03:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
in 2020 i' had been working for my
 
03:29:51.710 --> 03:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
current employer for over 5 years and
 
03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
knew my insurance premiums coverage and
 
03:29:55.429 --> 03:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
deductibles were some of the best in the
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
state it's important to note that my
 
03:29:59.550 --> 03:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
current organization is also has
 
03:30:02.030 --> 03:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
generous parental leave and a
 
03:30:03.870 --> 03:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive integrated Equity
 
03:30:06.990 --> 03:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
diversity inclusion and belonging
 
03:30:10.189 --> 03:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
program surely my benefits would make
 
03:30:13.469 --> 03:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
the most sense for us I did my due
 
03:30:15.630 --> 03:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
diligence and met with my benefits
 
03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
Department at work I shared the details
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
about Natalie's policy and the benefits
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
director and I agreed my organization's
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
policy likely made the most sense for
 
03:30:26.750 --> 03:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
us I then got that pit in my stomach and
 
03:30:29.710 --> 03:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
remembered to ask I just want to confirm
 
03:30:32.990 --> 03:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying we my future wife and I we
 
03:30:35.550 --> 03:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
are fully insured for fertility
 
03:30:37.429 --> 03:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
treatment she nodded and said
 
03:30:40.309 --> 03:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
emphatically yes Lindsay we are fully
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
insured in February 2021 we began our
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
family planning Journey a journey that
 
03:30:46.830 --> 03:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
we quickly learned would be Qui very
 
03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
costly for us after some initial tests
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
Natalie was ready to start II Cycles
 
03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
when we talked to our financial
 
03:30:57.550 --> 03:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
counselor at Boston ibf she told us our
 
03:30:59.590 --> 03:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
insurance does not in fact cover IUI
 
03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
treatment in cases where infertility has
 
03:31:02.950 --> 03:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
not been
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
diagnosed and we would need to complete
 
03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
12 Cycles unsuccessfully before
 
03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
infertility coverage would kick
 
03:31:13.389 --> 03:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
in the expected outof pocket cost would
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
be somewhere between 12,000 and 25,000
 
03:31:19.550 --> 03:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
depending on our particular course of
 
03:31:21.630 --> 03:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
treatment confused between what we had
 
03:31:23.229 --> 03:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
originally been told by our insurance
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
and what we were being told by the
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
fertility clinic we contacted our close
 
03:31:27.429 --> 03:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
friends who happened to work with
 
03:31:30.030 --> 03:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
Lindsay they had the same insurance
 
03:31:32.269 --> 03:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
plan and received treatment at the same
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
Fertility clinic with the same provider
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
our friend we asked our friends what her
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
and her husband had paid they were very
 
03:31:40.030 --> 03:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
confused by our question but shared that
 
03:31:41.870 --> 03:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
after 18 months of treatment they'd paid
 
03:31:44.590 --> 03:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
maybe $200 in co-pays their treatment
 
03:31:47.229 --> 03:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
was covered by Insurance well we would
 
03:31:48.670 --> 03:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
have to bear the burden of all costs
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
associated with our treatments in March
 
03:31:52.110 --> 03:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
of that year we contacted our
 
03:31:53.590 --> 03:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights attorney kathern
 
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
Tucker Katherine helped us request to
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
write paperwork from the insurance
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
company and encouraged us to appeal this
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
decision through that appeal we were
 
03:32:03.070 --> 03:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
provided with some additional relief the
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
number of out-of- pocket rounds was
 
03:32:06.750 --> 03:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
reduced to six given that we are two
 
03:32:08.429 --> 03:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
women in our 30s we made the decision to
 
03:32:10.590 --> 03:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
move forward with treatment at that time
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
each round of IUI cost us out of pocket
 
03:32:15.990 --> 03:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
$1,100 in addition to the cost of the
 
03:32:18.189 --> 03:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
IUI we also had to cover other fees
 
03:32:19.710 --> 03:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
associated with our treatment including
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
sperm medication and blood work we spent
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
$2,700 purchasing three vials of sperm
 
03:32:27.070 --> 03:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
one of which will be stored for future
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
use adding additional cost of $3,100 for
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
storage not including the storage fees
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
we spent a total of
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
$5,199 before having a successful
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy we have spent the past two
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
years discussing when we'd be ready to
 
03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
start trying for a second child the
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
primary deciding factor on timing was
 
03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
determining when we could balance the
 
03:32:49.630 --> 03:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
financial burden of fertility treatment
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
a factor most couples don't have to
 
03:32:54.750 --> 03:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
consider with each cycle we must examine
 
03:32:56.229 --> 03:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
other areas of our life and determine
 
03:32:58.030 --> 03:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
the priority balancing regular monthly
 
03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
expenses extracurriculars for our son or
 
03:33:02.429 --> 03:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
necessary Home Improvement projects
 
03:33:04.269 --> 03:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
three months ago we started a new round
 
03:33:06.309 --> 03:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
of IUI treatments and last week we had
 
03:33:07.870 --> 03:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
our third cycle of treatments in hopes
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
of bringing a second child into our
 
03:33:11.950 --> 03:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
family the cost of IUI treatment has
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
increased to
 
03:33:17.870 --> 03:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
$1,650 so far we have spent almost $633
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
on medication $441 on blood work and
 
03:33:22.750 --> 03:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
testing and
 
03:33:25.870 --> 03:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
$2,415 on two additional vials of sperm
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
bringing us to a current running total
 
03:33:27.479 --> 03:33:28.469 align:start position:0%
bringing us to a current running total
of

03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:33:35.550 --> 03:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
treatments our average total cost per
 
03:33:41.550 --> 03:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
cycle of IUI increased 45% between 2021
 
03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:42.229 align:start position:0%
cycle of IUI increased 45% between 2021
and

03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:43.950 --> 03:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
2024 from
 
03:33:47.229 --> 03:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
$250 to2
 
03:33:49.870 --> 03:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
$957 if we end up needing to pay for six
 
03:33:52.229 --> 03:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
cycles of IUI out of pocket this year we
 
03:33:54.950 --> 03:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
will spend over $18,000 before our
 
03:33:56.550 --> 03:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
insurance kicks
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
in we need to hear if a treatment was
 
03:34:01.030 --> 03:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
successful is an extremely stressful
 
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
period for us this stress is compounded
 
03:34:05.349 --> 03:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
as we are forced to look back at our
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
finances to determine when we can plan
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
for a fourth
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
round we know trying again right away
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
won't be an option for us as we have
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
spent almost $3,000 in the past three
 
03:34:19.269 --> 03:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
months for each
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
treatment we will probably need to take
 
03:34:23.070 --> 03:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
a few months off to save for additional
 
03:34:25.550 --> 03:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
Cycles our question for the committee is
 
03:34:27.950 --> 03:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
a simple one what is a family worth in
 
03:34:27.960 --> 03:34:29.110 align:start position:0%
a simple one what is a family worth in
New

03:34:29.110 --> 03:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for five cycles of IUI
 
03:34:34.269 --> 03:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
treatment to build a family so far we
 
03:34:37.469 --> 03:34:37.479 align:start position:0%
have SE spent $16
 
03:34:37.479 --> 03:34:39.910 align:start position:0%
have SE spent $16
16,5

03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
16,5
 
03:34:42.630 --> 03:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
125 if we need to complete additional
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
the additional full six Cycles
 
03:34:48.189 --> 03:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
IUI this round we will spend over
 
03:34:50.349 --> 03:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
$26,000 building a
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
family is it worth it absolutely is it
 
03:34:56.750 --> 03:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
fair and Equitable absolutely
 
03:35:00.349 --> 03:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
not the fact is it costs more to be a
 
03:35:02.710 --> 03:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
same-sex parent in New Hampshire than it
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
does to be a straight
 
03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
parent we new
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
hampsh in New Hampshire currently leaves
 
03:35:11.189 --> 03:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
it up to ures and companies to Define
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
what Equitable treatment actually looks
 
03:35:17.389 --> 03:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
like we fully support the mod modern
 
03:35:19.110 --> 03:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
economy act in the benefits it would
 
03:35:20.830 --> 03:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
provide to families across New Hampshire
 
03:35:22.030 --> 03:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the committee's
 
03:35:23.389 --> 03:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
consideration of such an impactful
 
03:35:23.399 --> 03:35:24.630 align:start position:0%
consideration of such an impactful
legislative

03:35:24.630 --> 03:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
spear the costs that you indicate or
 
03:35:39.469 --> 03:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
costs that are similar to the costs that
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
out this bill this current bill is
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
covering a very small part of
 
03:35:54.269 --> 03:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
that do you I I mean I is this going to
 
03:35:56.110 --> 03:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
make any difference to you I mean it's
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
such a small part of the whole cost of
 
03:36:02.510 --> 03:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
of IUI the whole package you know
 
03:36:04.229 --> 03:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
getting the sperm and everything else it
 
03:36:05.670 --> 03:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
would make a significant difference the
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
sperm alone cost so much money that
 
03:36:09.189 --> 03:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
being able to offset any of that cost
 
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
with any of the treatment being covered
 
03:36:13.229 --> 03:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
would allow us to immediately jump into
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
another cycle because we would be able
 
03:36:17.389 --> 03:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
