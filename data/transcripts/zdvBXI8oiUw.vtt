introduce
 
00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 align:start position:0%
senate bill 138 just a little bit of
 
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
background that's
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
this bill was originally on another
 
00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.869 align:start position:0%
this bill was originally on another
subject

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and an issue came before me from a
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
constituent who may hear from
 
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
about an issue dealing with investment
 
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.949 align:start position:0%
about an issue dealing with investment
medals

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
medals
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
contracts so we had a hearing on an
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
senate commerce and that amendment ended
 
00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 align:start position:0%
up replacing
 
00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
all of the underlying bills so that's
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
how it comes to you
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
today it came out of that the senate
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
comments five to zero and off the senate
 
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.509 align:start position:0%
comments five to zero and off the senate
for

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
24 to zero so what this bill does
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
is um it addresses an issue that has
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%
arisen for
 
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire who wish to take
 
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.950 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire who wish to take
part

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
in the trade of investment metals and
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
investment gems
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
and um what made this difficult for new
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire folks
 
00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 align:start position:0%
is that existing statute rsa421b1-102
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
32b3 says that the physical delivery of
 
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
metals must be made within 20 days to a
 
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.629 align:start position:0%
metals must be made within 20 days to a
person

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
or as a designated bank or licensed
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
broker dealer
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
only within new hampshire and this
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
created a lot of problems for the folks
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
who want to trade in this who might be
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
doing two-party trades back and forth
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the person from whom they bought
 
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
with the person from whom they bought
the

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
bought the medals and uh so they would
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
have to pay for shipment insurance and
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
postal costs and also delay
 
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
in their ability to make their their
 
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
in their ability to make their their
trades

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
trades
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm 15 others 15 other states have
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
done this
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of developing the
 
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.150 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of developing the
language

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
um here i wanted to make sure that we
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
from barry glennon of the new hampshire
 
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%

depository here
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
and to uh make sure we had an
 
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.790 align:start position:0%
and to uh make sure we had an
appropriate

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
number of days for the delivery
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
and with that uh he supported the bill
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and um and we put in the in the bill
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
the language that he thought that that
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
we needed
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
um so to conclude um mr chairman i i
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
what the bill does is it balances
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
provides new hampshire's with
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to better dissipate uh
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
in these markets and um i'd be happy to
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions you have
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah so i don't it's barry i don't
 
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.710 align:start position:0%
um yeah so i don't it's barry i don't
see

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
barry coming on so the only thing
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
that uh that piqued my interest was um
 
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
this is in the uniform securities act
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
and generally and i noticed maybe not
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
you can't really answer this question so
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
but uh generally the securities uh
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
uniform acts
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
are you know there's a com entity in
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
chicago that comes out with these
 
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.309 align:start position:0%
chicago that comes out with these
uniform

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
statutes and they're all uniform so um
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
i hear you saying that this language is
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
in other
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
states but it's not actually promoted by
 
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.070 align:start position:0%
states but it's not actually promoted by
the

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
that entity in chicago or the uniform
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
commercial dinner for
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
the you know we're inserting it into our
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
security attack are you familiar with
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
this at all
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
yeah somewhat uh thank you mr chairman
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the original regulations were
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
adopted back in 1985
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
and boy a whole lot has changed in all
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh training and markets
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
since that time and um of course
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
the uniformed securities act allows
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
states to make its own regulations
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
which all states do to ensure um
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
consumer protection ought to recognize
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
the particularities there but
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
in this case um so much has changed in
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
the trading of precious
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
metals assuming investment metals that
 
00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.110 align:start position:0%
metals assuming investment metals that
um

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know states have said look we've got
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
to we've got to make it possible for our
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
residents to
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know i mean i believe strong in free
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
markets and um you know our residents
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to participate in this
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know a very a relatively minor fix
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
to our state statute that then
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
enables people to do that um i have i'm
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
not aware of
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
any um objection um
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
based on the uh national act and um
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know the other states that have gone
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
down this this road um
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know have done this for several
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
years so i think it's a good way for us
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire of new hampshire folks
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay we do have questions now
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
representative mclaren
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh mr chairman so my
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this would
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
allow me to hold the middle contracts
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh actual gold and silver and whatever
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh with that
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
in my ira with somebody that possesses
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
it physically
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
out of state so they don't have to be in
 
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire correct
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
right so they have to be shipped um now
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
of course you have to have
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
all the appropriate documentation and
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
protections that you've they've
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
been delivered to an innocent to a
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
depository of your choice and so on and
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to be in new
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that was the bottleneck
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
that you had to get them here and that
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
meant you had to have a relationship
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
with the bank
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh and this and that the other thing and
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
then if you're making
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
trades quickly um that sure
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult for you so i've
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
already done this i hope i'm
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
not subject to arrest
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
well me too uh representative thank you
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
for your question
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
would you believe representative johnson
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
question my question is you had
 
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.070 align:start position:0%
question my question is you had
mentioned

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
something about in the
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill it says seven day period but did
 
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
bill it says seven day period but did
you

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
said something about a 20-day period can
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
you elaborate because you kind of lost
 
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.389 align:start position:0%
you elaborate because you kind of lost
me

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
on that i think thanks for the question
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know jumbled over that um originally
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
we had the
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
the the 21 days and um
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
barry glennon said uh he thought it'd be
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
much more appropriate to have seven days
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
and um that made sense so that's why we
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
changed it to seven here
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
so you shortened up the number of days
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
want to make which to me doesn't make a
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
lot of sense because if you're
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
you're wanting to give everybody enough
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
time you you 20 days
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
seems more reasonable if you're trying
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
to maneuver things around but now you're
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
just taking it from 20 to 70.
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
yeah and and seven is really the
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
consumer protection there that if you've
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
bought it you ought to have
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
possession of them and then be able to
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh make another trade or do what you
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
want with them
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
so that that's why barry glennon was
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
um with with us and requested we moved
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative ben
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
houghton good morning thank you mr chair
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you senator for being here
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to confess to complete
 
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
ignorance in this i did some research
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh checked it out a little bit more and
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of quick questions and i
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
hope that maybe someone will be
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
following you who will give us a primer
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
on this are you talking about physical
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
location location of the metals
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then a certificate to guarantee that
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
they are there
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for the question and i mean
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
that's the point
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
that you know you have to have in one
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
way or another
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
possession of the medals
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
and what we're saying is that the
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
possession here
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
can take place that they said there may
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
be could be sent to you personally
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
or you can designate a depository
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
in which they are held and i hope that
 
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.190 align:start position:0%
in which they are held and i hope that
um

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
mr coda is on is available because he
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
trades in this and brought the issue to
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
my attention and i think he can
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably give you a pretty good sense of
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
just you know what the nuts and bolts
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
are of somebody
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
who participates in this these trades
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay he wasn't on my sheet but i'm
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
pulling them up
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
we do have we do have for further
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative van gaal
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and i thank you for that
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
explanation because that makes a lot of
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
are there certain depositories that have
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
to be uh somehow certified somehow
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
safety certified because if i'm owning
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
diamonds which obviously i will be doing
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
shortly um
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
i want them safe how does that work
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
well um let's let's mr kota address that
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
but you'll see in the definitions part
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
there that it does say the depository
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the warehouse receipts of which are
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for delivery purposes for any
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
commodity in a contract market
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
designated by the commodity futures
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
trading commission so
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
um and then uh storage facility licensed
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
or regulated by the united states for an
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
agency united states or a depository
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
designated by
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
et cetera so it's those sections of the
 
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.389 align:start position:0%
et cetera so it's those sections of the
bill

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
that make sure that you're dealing with
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
a place that's recognized as licensed on
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%

legislation a number of years ago
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
good material here for us yes uh well
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
i have uh i have bought and and sold
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
precious metals with a uh dealer and
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
they mail me uh the
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
the medals and when i want to sell them
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh i have to call them and
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
they send me a uh a box with a label
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
that i have to pack them and then send
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
them back and when they receive them
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
then i can sell them but i'm selling
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
them then at that price
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
at that time not at the price i would
 
00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:25.990 align:start position:0%
at that time not at the price i would
want

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
to sell as if they were say stocks
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i also have to pay you know the
 
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.550 align:start position:0%
uh and i also have to pay you know the
cost

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the shipping and the insurance which
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
is quite a bit
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
um and my uh
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
my broker at that at the company
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
told me that about this program where
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
they could store them in a depository
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
and um i wouldn't have to pay for
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
shipping and i would get a lower
 
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.069 align:start position:0%
shipping and i would get a lower
commission

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd be able to sell just by calling
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
and selling
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
and be able to sell immediately um and i
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
filled out the application
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
and then he told me oh uh there are five
 
00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:06.550 align:start position:0%
and then he told me oh uh there are five
states

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
uh in the united states where we are not
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh in the united states where we are not
allowed

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
to use this option and new hampshire is
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
five states uh because it's against new
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
so um i could be across
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
the border in maine or massachusetts or
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
vermont or most of the country
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
and do this but i couldn't do it in new
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire because of the law
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh letting letting the senator know
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
about this and
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
because we don't like to be behind on
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
anything that comes to new hampshire but
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
oh we do have another question
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative mccleary uh thank you
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh mr coda are you dealing with
 
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.909 align:start position:0%
uh mr coda are you dealing with
non-qualified

00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
non-qualified
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
accounts or qualified accounts
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what that means in other
 
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know what that means in other
words

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
i i have precious metals but it's it's
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
in a qualified account an ira account
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i never knew knew there was a
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
problem with that but you're talking
 
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.789 align:start position:0%
problem with that but you're talking
about

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh oh it's not an ira an ira
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
yeah not an ira okay that's all i wanted
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
to know thank you right
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
right you're you're just buying platinum
 
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.909 align:start position:0%
right you're you're just buying platinum
and

00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then marking it up and selling it to
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
somebody else who might be making no no
 
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
somebody else who might be making no no
no

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not marketing it to somebody else
 
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
the company that i deal with
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
maintains a two-way market and so i buy
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
from them and and if the price goes up
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
and i want to take a profit
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
i can sell it back to them ah
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
okay so you're basically they make a
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
profit on it
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
they make a margin but if the price goes
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
up by a significant amount i still make
 
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.950 align:start position:0%
up by a significant amount i still make
money

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
so theoretically they're using your
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
money to go out and buy more metals and
 
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know you're basically somewhat of an
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
underwriter for them
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
they're well they're like a stock broker
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
except instead of
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
stocks they're selling actual physical
 
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.470 align:start position:0%
stocks they're selling actual physical
metal

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
metal
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
amazing okay uh we do have more
 
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.710 align:start position:0%
amazing okay uh we do have more
questions

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative terry thank you mr
 
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.909 align:start position:0%
representative terry thank you mr
chairman

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh dare i ask senator waters or
 
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
mr cotta are you aware i think one of
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
these restrictions are in play do either
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
of you have any idea what the rationale
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
is or is this
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
is this just kind of legacy left over
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
from the way things were done in the
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
past and the other states have already
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
effectively reformed if i may answer
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and i and i appreciate miss dakota's
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
correction too i think i had a typo
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
that i had 15 states instead of 45 so
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
i'm glad we got that straightened out um
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
but i
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
my sense is that we just haven't caught
 
00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
my sense is that we just haven't caught
up

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh here and um it's it's it's like a lot
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
of things i mean that 1985 is a long
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
time ago when it comes to markets
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
and a lot has a lot has changed so it uh
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know i mean it's similar to what
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
we've done in some other areas when
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a constituent or a
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
business that comes forward and says
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
look we have to
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
we have to revise our bills i mean i
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
think back a few years ago we did that
 
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
think back a few years ago we did that
massive

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
massive
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
rewriting of the banking legislation
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
same thing it was an opportunity to
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
catch up on a lot of
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of things so i i think this is
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
just to catch up catching up with the
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
markets so that
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
individuals you know i mean again i i
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
strongly believe in free markets and an
 
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.070 align:start position:0%
strongly believe in free markets and an
individual

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire wants to participate in
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
the trading of investment metals and
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
investment gems that
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
they ought to be able to do it in in a
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
way that lets them
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
lets them operate so and i don't know
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
george if any other thoughts on that but
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
just it it's a great um would be a great
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
convenience to be able to have them
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
store it
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
and it would give me they would give me
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
a lower commission and i wouldn't have
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
to pay postage i would have to pay
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh a small monthly storage fee
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
but their storage fee is small compared
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh other expenses and the values of the
 
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
uh other expenses and the values of the
metals

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
but you still have to take it back and
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
then ship it back to them and to put it
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
no i i would just i call them up i say i
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
want to buy
 
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of metal and i have
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
money in the account they use that money
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the account to buy it
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then they buy it and they put it in
 
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:51.750 align:start position:0%
and then they buy it and they put it in
storage

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
storage
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay currently or with this legislation
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
with this legislation okay but currently
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you were to do that you would have to
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
have it shipped to new hampshire yes i'd
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
have it
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
yeah which has got to be shipping costs
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
insurance costs and
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah loan vulnerability to handling
 
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
yeah loan vulnerability to handling
anything

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
so okay uh are you all set here for my
 
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
so okay uh are you all set here for my
follow-up

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
for the for the question yes you may
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
inquire just to follow up i i
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
i never thought that um in moving from
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
rhode island to uh new hampshire that i
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
moving behind the times but this is
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
one of those first in rare instances
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
where i was able to do something in
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
rhode island that apparently i would not
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
yet in new hampshire and i hope we can
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
get this corrected thank you mr chairman
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative eminent has not
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
asked the question yet
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this question is
 
00:22:47.919 --> 00:22:48.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and this question is
for

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
mr coda as an individual
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
we talk about consumer protection is it
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
safer for you
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
to store the platinum in your house
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
or in a depository
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
i think it would be safer to store it in
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
a depository
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
and and because uh for the question
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh because you're at risk you're uh
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
providing your own security
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent theft and in a depository
 
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.909 align:start position:0%
to prevent theft and in a depository
they

00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they have much better security
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
for you is that correct
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative van gaal you have a
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
new question
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for for
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
testifying to us today
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
um i have a very very basic question i
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
note that we're talking about investment
 
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.590 align:start position:0%
note that we're talking about investment
metal

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
metal
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
is it always investment metal or at any
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
point does the metal become
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
jewelry for instance is it always
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
well it says investment gems too right
 
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.470 align:start position:0%
well it says investment gems too right
well

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the wording of this
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill but
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
um the only in metals the only things
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
participate in with this uh broker are
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
if i may if i may um just mention
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
barry glennon said that he thought the
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate language was
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
investment medals and investment gems um
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why we have those terms in the
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill he thought he said in terms of
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
statute those are the words to use
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
so would we imagine that investment
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
means it might be a little more raw form
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
that it hasn't been turned into rings or
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
or the the diamond hasn't been uh
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
shaped yet i already call it when you
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
chip away at a diamond and make it a
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
nice diamond
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering too if it has to stay
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
in that form throughout
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh to qualify for this contract in other
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
words if i
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
if i sell my medals or my diamonds to a
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
jeweler do i now come out of this
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
contract with this business i i i i must
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
say that there's so much here that i
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't really understand and so my
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions are very basic and if you can
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
help me with it i'd appreciate that
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that again it's
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
investment so so
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you were a jeweler and you're going
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
to take that and start doing stuff with
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
it and then you're changing its form so
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
at that point it's not an investment per
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
se i would think
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
but i can we can certainly get barry get
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
him to respond to us for that question
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for the
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh scene
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
we thank you very much and we'll close
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh we had five people in support um
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
looks like all senators and uh
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
and one i guess uh uh perkins
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
hug uh center oh it's a this is again
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
another senator okay so all senators
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh were in support five centers in
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
support no opposition and nobody neutral
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
now with that we'll close the public
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
senate bill 138 and um
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
senator we don't exact bills on the same
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
day here in commerce
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
so uh stay tuned
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
we have a whole month exact thing so so
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
we're all set there
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
all right so the time being 10
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
27 so we have three minutes before we
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
and so i see yes okay you're also on
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%

00:26:50.840 --> 00:27:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
um so i'll ask the attendees if you
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%

00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
raise your hand so i'll know
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
who's interested in speaking on this
 
00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:25.110 align:start position:0%
who's interested in speaking on this
bill

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yep uh since we have about a
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
minute and a half i just thought i would
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
take the opportunity to address the
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
question of um
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative van houghton with
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
particularly with respect to the
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
precious metals
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
that that we we're talking about um
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh gold silver platinum etc we're
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
talking about bullion
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
bars or we're talking about coins
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
or we're talking about slugs in other
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
words um
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
they look like coins but they're just
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
silver or gold or platinum but they're
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
they're there's no imprint upon them
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
some of the coins can be historic
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
coins and so it's it's it's a whole
 
00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:17.669 align:start position:0%
coins and so it's it's it's a whole
range

00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
range
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
of um product that's available um
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
for investment yeah but i see to me
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
um it's surprised that you say coins
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
because the coins are a finished
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
product so the value is not just in the
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
metal itself but it's in
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
all that you know the age and and the
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
stamp and whatever
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
like because it's a finished product
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
whereas when we talk about
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
when i think investment metals like you
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
say it's like it's like
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
gold bar you know that ingot and
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
so but like i said we learned something
 
00:28:49.679 --> 00:28:49.990 align:start position:0%
so but like i said we learned something
new

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
every day in commerce and um and
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
just for the record i was elected in 86
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
it didn't
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
it was not around when this legislation
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
passed in 85.
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
i wasn't i was in new hampshire but i
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
was not an elected official at the time
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10 30. we'll open up the
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
and the only center i got is you senator
 
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
and the only center i got is you senator
waters

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just have part
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
three of this so i didn't know
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
how if you're going to proceed it's the
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
senator who was had
 
00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
kavanaugh must be uh i know senate
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
commerce might be
 
00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
busy so he is probably still over there
 
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.870 align:start position:0%
busy so he is probably still over there
but

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
so um so you want to talk to section
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
three of the bill so that's fine
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman i'd be happy
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm senator david water district four
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
and let me just say that i am
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
um 1 24 and you'll see
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's and i'm almost sheepish to say
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's another one of the senate omnibus
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
bills why do they do
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
this mortgageborg or tasting menu i mean
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
at least this one is all about insurance
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
unlike some of which are
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
you know three or four different house
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
committees um
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
but you'll see the various underlying
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
parts to it and um
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
if if you if you would like mr chairman
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh since the others aren't here i can
 
00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:12.789 align:start position:0%
uh since the others aren't here i can
speak

00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
to um part three which is my partner
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's what i would like you to focus on
 
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:17.430 align:start position:0%
that's what i would like you to focus on
yeah

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much um so part
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
three uh is relative to self storage
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
insurance it's on page 13 of the of the
 
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.110 align:start position:0%
insurance it's on page 13 of the of the
bill

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
is where it begins and um this may look
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
very familiar to you all
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
because uh you work did great work on it
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
last year and then it got all caught up
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
in covet so um
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
so here we are um and i will say it is
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
basically the same bill except for just
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
a couple little wiggles that the
 
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.950 align:start position:0%
a couple little wiggles that the
insurance

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
commission um wanted so
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
um let me just go through it uh briefly
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
for you and we do have i believe some
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
representatives from the um
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
industry and uh let me also say that
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
um is actually the second second of
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
bills on
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
self storage we've dealt with over the
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
last several years
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
and here again really trying to to to
 
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:07.750 align:start position:0%
and here again really trying to to to
bring

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
bring
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire statute up to date as
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
to how the industry
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
is functioning and i'm sure you all know
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
how important an industry
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh this is in in new hampshire
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it allows self
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
storage facilities to sell property
 
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.389 align:start position:0%
storage facilities to sell property
insurance

00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
for its renters um
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
really the kind of key to it is uh on in
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
section um roman for uh
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
roman 8 you'll find on page 14 where it
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
defines self storage insurance
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
personal property insurance offered in
 
00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
connection with an incidental to the
 
00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.789 align:start position:0%
connection with an incidental to the
rental

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
rental
 
00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
of rented space at a self storage
 
00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:48.389 align:start position:0%
of rented space at a self storage
facility

00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
and provides coverage for loss or damage
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
of what's there or what's in
 
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
of what's there or what's in
transportation

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
to and from it and this is important to
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
note this is a very limited
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
license for this it's just for this
 
00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.630 align:start position:0%
license for this it's just for this
product

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
it won't allow you to sell any other
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
kind of insurance it's just for
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
renters who want to take the convenience
 
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.509 align:start position:0%
renters who want to take the convenience
here

00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
and what's important to on page 15 uh
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
again trying to balance the um you know
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
commerce that
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh want people want to undertake and the
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
convenience that renters may want to
 
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.789 align:start position:0%
convenience that renters may want to
undertake

00:32:22.789 --> 00:32:22.799 align:start position:0%
undertake
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
with appropriate consumer um protections
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
and so here
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
it says that very very clearly uh the
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
claims process
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
the costs of um the insurance
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh and the language there that must be
 
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.149 align:start position:0%
uh and the language there that must be
posted

00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
posted
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
um all be transparent and available
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the purchaser her purchaser here
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
um also important to note that this is a
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
policy that's limited to ten thousand
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and then again with the
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
with appropriate consumer protection
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
that the policies are regulated by
 
00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.750 align:start position:0%
that the policies are regulated by
existing

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
insurance uh commission statutes rsa
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
for 12-5 two
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
um then the bill also goes into the
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
owner's responsibility
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the owners must provide the
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate training
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
they must have a plan for that training
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
that gets approved by the
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
commission they must establish an
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate and transparent
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
um billing uh procedure
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and then there is language about license
 
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.909 align:start position:0%
and then there is language about license
application

00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
and uh then also i think importantly too
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
just to notice the um effective date is
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
the first of january 22
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
so that it gives time for the insurance
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
commission and for
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
the industry to gear up get trained get
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
get their plans um
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
together get the appropriate materials
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
together decide whether they want to
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
offer this product
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
or or not uh so uh you know those of us
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
who've been around in new hampshire for
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
a while might remember that
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
the devastating fire at the storage
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
facility in portsmouth
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's just really important
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
that people have the opportunity to have
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
insurance if they
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
if they want to get it and this also
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
provides a
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
a very light touch of regulation that we
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that the product is being
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
presented and sold appropriately by
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
people who are trained to do it
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
but they are not full-time insurance
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
agents licensed to do
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
other things um and so this means that
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
it will be simple and impossible to
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
offer this product
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh for folks who are using rentage uh
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
and self storage facilities so mr
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
there you have it okay and we do have
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
some questions
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh let's see who's first here uh so
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
first was representative burroughs uh
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
um again this is new to me so um
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's more to understand why is
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
why does the the um the uh
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
property that that does the storage why
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
are they not
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
the ones who are carry the insurance
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
rather than the individual
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
owner people who rent out the storage
 
00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
owner people who rent out the storage
space

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question i want
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
some industry folks here but
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
um you know i i always think i'm
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for my property
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
in a way you know if i'm in my house um
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
i i buy insurance uh for my for my
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
property um
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure that they have insurance on
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
their own building
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
but if it's my stuff or my car that's
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
being stored there
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that you know if
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's fire
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
or theft or whatever that i have
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
protection for my
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
for my property so that's that that's
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
the way i would
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
i would see it thank you okay
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that you have to
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
have an insurable interest to be able to
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
purchase insurance so the self-storage
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
manager or owner doesn't have an
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
insurable interest in your
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
personal property so that's always a
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
basic um
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
i have to tell you that having an
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
insurance background this
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
at first blush makes it difficult for me
 
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:17.109 align:start position:0%
at first blush makes it difficult for me
to

00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
want to support this could you give me
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
um senator
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
waters could you give me a little um
 
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.550 align:start position:0%
waters could you give me a little um
background

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
about how this bill was presented and
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
whether the insurance department was
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
um i know you're talking about just part
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
three and whether the insurance
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
department was
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
um involved in in
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
presenting it well thank you for your
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett and um as i
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
said this is the second year on this
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and and your committee uh house commerce
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
worked on this
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know very effectively last last year
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then we you know covet disrupted
 
00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.030 align:start position:0%
uh and then we you know covet disrupted
it

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
and all along there's been close work
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department on language on
 
00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
insurance department on language on
posting

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
posting
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
some of the language here is what they
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
wanted the noticing they
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
asked for um considerable
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
changes both last year you know
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
particularly last year to get the
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
language where it ought to be and the
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
procedures where they
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
they ought to be on offering this
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
product um and i think that what's
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
significant here is that you know a lot
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks who get a storage unit
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're in between jobs they're
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're moving or they have one reason
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
they've got to have their
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh a storage facility and um it's and or
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
they got to get their a car stored
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere or a boat
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
and um you know it's a question of their
 
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.030 align:start position:0%
and um you know it's a question of their
conv

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
conv
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
convenience and also consumer choice um
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know that you'd have an opportunity
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
to at that at one
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
one place if you didn't already have um
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
homeowners or apartment insurance that
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
you get your
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
you could get your your possessions
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
insured for relatively low cost um
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
yes for the question being acquired
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes i'm aware that the
 
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:08.710 align:start position:0%
thank you um yes i'm aware that the
market

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
um to cover personal property in a
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
storage unit
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
is um is limited
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
and right if if you are between places
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
you aren't going to get an extension
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
past 30 days
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
during a moving process and of course
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
automobiles are not going to be covered
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
under your homeowners
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
you give this authority to a
 
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.030 align:start position:0%
you give this authority to a
self-storage

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
self-storage
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
ownership or manager to sell insurance
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
um you
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
the the bill provides for training but
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
it talks about training but what is the
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
insurance department so
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
let me let me let me interject here
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
because i i believe i was a co-sponsor
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
um so this is similar we've had several
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
one this is similar
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
is when you buy a cell phone
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
and you and they want to sell you an
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
extended warranty
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the cell phone and we had to do the
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
same thing with the legislation we had
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
to carve out that they weren't going to
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
be the same
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
deep structure that we require insurance
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
agents because this is just a service
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
being added on
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
by the uh storage facility so that
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
you get in the storage facility you've
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
just been notified that by the way
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
um you're obligated to ensure this
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
and and the person goes where where am i
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
going to find an agent where i
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
don't and they said well we actually
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
have that product here
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we can sell it for you if you would
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill is i mean i i
 
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
understand ten thousand dollars is a
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
very small amount and
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
and by the time you're getting into
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
valuation of property that you're not
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's not in your possession um you know
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
that could be an issue but that's really
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
up to the insurance
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
adjuster to deal with um i i
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have a i don't have a big
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
problem with this but i sure would like
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
to get into the weeds a little bit
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
right right now we're just asking
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
questions yeah i understand thank you
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh next up is
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you senator
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
waters uh for
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
for discussing this with us um i know we
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
worked on this uh this that house
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
commerce worked on this
 
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
um previously
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm unsure
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
however whether there well you mentioned
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
that the market
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
the the the current insurance market um
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's difficult to find an insurance
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
company that will cover this
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh in the in in our present statuses is
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
that correct or
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
did i misunderstand that thanks for your
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
question and i i didn't mean to imply
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
that i i
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
to me it's this question of convenience
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and whether or not any coverage you have
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
would actually apply it might otherwise
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
have would actually apply
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
here and that's why we have the consumer
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
protection in the bill saying that that
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh the first the renter would be
 
00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh the first the renter would be
informed

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
informed
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
you may you may already have for
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
insurance on this uh
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
you know so it's like when you rent a
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
car you know you may already have
 
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.270 align:start position:0%
car you know you may already have
insurance

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
that covers this but you want to buy
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
ours um but as i said we do have i
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
believe we have
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
a representative from the national
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
industry and then uh representative from
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh facility who will be available to you
 
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:30.790 align:start position:0%
uh facility who will be available to you
today

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
um and i think some they'll probably be
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
able to

introduction of myself and then i'm
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions from the
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
committee so i i am the
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh in-house attorney for the national
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
self-storage association
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
we support this bill it's similar to
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that has been passed
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
in 40 states now including vermont
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and several other
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
nearby northeastern states
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 50
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
000 self-storage tenants in the state of
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
this provides them with a low-cost
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
option to get
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage this is something
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
that there
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
are you know there are markets for this
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
but it's difficult to get it through
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
and ensure an existing insurance agent
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's just you know the
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
the policies are very low dollar value
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
and there's not frankly a lot of
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
incentive for an insurance agent to sell
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
a standalone one of these policies
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it'll be a tag along to a
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
homeowners if you have one or something
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
like that but
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
as a standalone policy it's not
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
something we typically see
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
and with folks as senator waters
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
indicated with folks who are in
 
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.390 align:start position:0%
indicated with folks who are in
transition

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't have existing coverage
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
there is nothing to
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
tack on to it is however solely an
 
00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:43.829 align:start position:0%
tack on to it is however solely an
option

00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
it's not something that can be forced
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
upon the tenant that is in the
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
disclosures that are provided to the
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
consumer so if you have
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
another form of coverage already great
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's fine and that you know that'll be
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
that'll be that and you'll be covered
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
through that finally i'll just point out
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
that these are
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
underwritten by known insurance
 
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.829 align:start position:0%
underwritten by known insurance
companies

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
maybe not household names per se but
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
names that are known within the industry
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
aig great american hanover and then the
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
the training that's provided and the
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
oversight that's provided for these
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
programs is provided by
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
licensed insurance agent so licensed
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
insurance agents
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
are involved in the process with that
 
00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.750 align:start position:0%
are involved in the process with that
training

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the oversight of the program but
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
they're not actually the person
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
standing behind the desk and for
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
efficiency's sake uh the
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
you know rather than licensing everybody
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
who might be standing behind a desk at a
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
self-storage facility
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
you have this process that's been
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
accepted in 40 other states now
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
where the employees of the facility work
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
under that license and again
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
are trained and overseen by uh by
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
licensed insurance agents again i'm also
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
happy to speak to the
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know speak to our discussions
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department but i
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
didn't want to
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
preempt any representative from the
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
insurance department who may be here
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
to to speak about that but i'm happy to
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
speak about that as well mr chairman
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh and you're willing to take
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes i am
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
all right so representative diploma
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
um i was curious would this apply to
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
portable storage
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
companies that deliver self storage to a
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
customer's site
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
or would that only apply specifically at
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
a storage facility
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative de palma it would only
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
apply at us at a physical storage
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
facility would not apply to portable
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
storage units and have a follow-up mr
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
chairman for the question being acquired
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
if that storage company did have a self
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
storage facility on site and also did
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
portable storage
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
could they still offer the insurance or
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be allowed they could
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
offer the insurance
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
to you for folks who had a unit at the
 
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.270 align:start position:0%
to you for folks who had a unit at the
site

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
but if you know if something you know my
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
neighbors here
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
in my community that you know they'll
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
have a portable storage unit sitting in
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
their driveway
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
you couldn't use it to ensure that you'd
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
you but you could probably get that on
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
your homeowners as well but if the
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
if if the property were stored at the
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
site of the storage facility it could be
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
insured under this
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
type of policy if you get a my box
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
and have it deliver your home you got to
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
get your homeowners to cover it
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
but if you get the my box right there at
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
the site of the of
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
their rental business then it would be
 
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
their rental business then it would be
okay

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
good question all right and now
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative ham
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for taking my
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
question i think my question was
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
kind of answered i was concerned these
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh these contracts these insurance
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
policies are sold through
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
an insurance company a licensed
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
underwritten by that company so you have
 
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
underwritten by that company so you have
a

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
an independent um agent there in between
 
00:47:07.359 --> 00:47:07.750 align:start position:0%

is there a um
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
and i could be reading it wrong does the
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
storage facility
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is offering this insurance are they
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
going to be making
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
a commission or a profit on selling this
 
00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.710 align:start position:0%
a commission or a profit on selling this
insurance

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative johnson yes
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
a potential for compensation to the
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
storage facility
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
and and that is yeah that's something
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's part of the
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
the existing fee structure that's
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the insurance department on
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
on the filings with the department
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for the question we
 
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.349 align:start position:0%
follow-up question for the question we
inquire

00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
so the story would the storage facility
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
have to could they
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
mandate that people who rent from them
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
now have to buy this insurance in order
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
to rent from them
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
is this going to something that can come
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
down the line where they can try to
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
mandate this if you want to use a
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
specific facility
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representative johnson no
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
they cannot that that is specifically
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
addressed in
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
in the law and it's a specific
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
disclosure given to the consumer that
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
this cannot be mandated
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
5-0 with an amendment agreed to by the
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
industry and the insurance department

legislation
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
built on the need for states to have a
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
clear regulatory framework for insurance
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
travel insurance
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
it has passed in 11 states and being
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
considered in many other states this
 
00:50:56.079 --> 00:50:56.870 align:start position:0%
considered in many other states this
year

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill will benefit
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
consumers by requiring
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
explicit consumer disclosures prohibit
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
opt-out sales
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%

trade practices act
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
additionally it will empower power the
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
department of insurance
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
currently regulations for travel
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
insurance are based mostly on health
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
insurance law
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
and limited to distinguishing aspects of
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
travel insurance
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
from major medical and or other
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
categories of health insurance
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
the rules were a creative approach to
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
providing guidance and this bill
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
attempts to build off that work
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
and allow the department to create rules
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
and procedures beyond the current
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
limited scope
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
finally the bill will ensure a fair
 
00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:41.430 align:start position:0%
finally the bill will ensure a fair
marketplace

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
by addressing travel insurance elements
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
not in current regulations
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
specifically the bill defines travel
 
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.549 align:start position:0%
specifically the bill defines travel
retailers

00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
travel administrators travel protection
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
plans and sales practices
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
you will hear additional testimony from
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.710 align:start position:0%

the senate passed senate bill 416
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
however like other parts of of this bill
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
it died on the table
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
part two was refiled at the request of
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
the liberty mutual group
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
which owns 18 new hampshire-based

in total they employ over 3 500 people
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
and additionally the investments held by
 
00:53:39.839 --> 00:53:41.510 align:start position:0%
and additionally the investments held by
those

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries are worth over 25 billion
 
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.829 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries are worth over 25 billion
dollars

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
rsa 402 colon 28 governs the types of
 
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.390 align:start position:0%
rsa 402 colon 28 governs the types of
investments

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
investments
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
that domestic insurance companies can
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
make in new hampshire
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
part two of this bill would add
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
replications to the list of permissible
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
investment transactions
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
they can make replications are a
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
combination of a bond and a derivative
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
that are intended to replicate the
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
performance of an asset
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
that an insurer is permitted to make
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
under existing law
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
currently 30 states allow domestic
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
insurers to invest in replications
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
essentially part 2 would allow liberty
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
mutual and other domestic insurers
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
to use replication transactions along
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
with other derivative transactions
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
to better access financial markets now
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's a shame but uh
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
attorney russo who who usually testifies
 
00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.109 align:start position:0%

excellent
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me senator sherman
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
i assume you're here for 125
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah for the next bill
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
no i'm here for 120 for the last section
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
oh perfect great all right well then
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh mr chair and
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is uh probably i think the briefest
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
bill i've ever submitted but
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is uh essentially a bill that i
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
worked with
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
tyler brandon on recognizing that
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
when you have a medicare supplemental
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
insurance and you are
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
disabled and under 65 you then
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
when you turn 65 you continue medicare
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
supplemental insurance
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
but there was a practice that was not
 
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.230 align:start position:0%
but there was a practice that was not
ubiquitous

00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
but it was clearly occurring where the
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
would not tell you that you actually are
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for a
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
much less expensive supplemental
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
insurance policy when you turn 65.
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
so the original bill which was filed
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
last year and
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
died a coveted death uh is back
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's better than ever it's shorter and
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh senator daniels who as you know works
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh arena um actually
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
fixed a a section of it that would have
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
had unintended consequences so
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
this is incredibly simple it just says
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
that when
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
you turn 65 and you're disabled
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
you um uh no issuer
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
shall continue to charge that member the
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
under 65 premium which
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
is uh universally higher than the
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
over 65 premium so it it gives you that
 
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.549 align:start position:0%
over 65 premium so it it gives you that
automatic

00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
shift to the new premium when you turn
 
00:57:57.359 --> 00:57:58.470 align:start position:0%
shift to the new premium when you turn
65

00:57:58.470 --> 00:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
65
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
and stops the practice of
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
continuing a higher charge for those who
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
were not aware that they are
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
continuing to be charged at the under 65
 
00:58:07.839 --> 00:58:09.829 align:start position:0%
continuing to be charged at the under 65
rate

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
perfect any questions for senator
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
sherman we do have representative
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
see if i can get this working can you
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
hear me yes we can
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you for taking my
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
question um so this is on part four of
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
uh i'm reading uh page 17 lines 23 and
 
00:58:29.359 --> 00:58:30.230 align:start position:0%
uh i'm reading uh page 17 lines 23 and
24.

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
24.
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
it says upon a medicare eligible
 
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.349 align:start position:0%
it says upon a medicare eligible
disabled

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
member obtaining the age of 65 no issuer
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
shall continue to charge that member of
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
the under age 65 premium
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't say
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
more or less would they be allowed to
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
charge a war
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh technically
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh yes you know it's not telling
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
what that charge over 65 would be but
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
the problem is that in
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
across all carriers and and i think
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
tyler can answer this
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
even better than i can because he's the
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
one who monitors this
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
the medsup is less expensive when you
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
turn 65
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
than when you are under 65
 
00:59:26.069 --> 00:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
and disabled so the the
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
process was that they would continue to
 
00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.109 align:start position:0%
process was that they would continue to
charge

00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
the under 65 rate which was higher
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
even though the person was eligible for
 
00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
a lower rate but it
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh did not but they were not required to
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
to notify or to change to the lower rate
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that makes sense because you're
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
under 65 you're many technically you're
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
medically underwrited
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
whereas over 65 it's mandated that
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
under no underwriting occurring correct
 
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:56.789 align:start position:0%
under no underwriting occurring correct
so

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:58.829 --> 00:59:58.839 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but that's a good
 
00:59:58.839 --> 01:00:00.150 align:start position:0%
that makes sense but that's a good
question

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't understand oh my god my
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um let's see
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh i guess what i'll do um
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
tyler let me you might as well have
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
tyler come up and
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
are you are you there tyler or did i
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i hope
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
you guys can't yeah yep great wouldn't
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
you go ahead and talk about
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh this one while we're doing medicare
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
at this moment
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
so tyler brandon life and health
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
director with insurance department
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
um we don't actually have a position on
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
but most of what i would say is
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
favorable and it wasn't a department
 
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.670 align:start position:0%
favorable and it wasn't a department
request

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a funny
 
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.789 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a funny
situation

01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
we have received complaints from
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
consumers who have been continued
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
with that disabled premium which i think
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
was explained before
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
is higher so we don't regulate medicare
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
advantage or medicare but we do have a
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
limited role with medicare
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
supplemental and there are essentially
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
two open enrollment periods possible if
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
you're disabled
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
so you can qualify for medicare under 65
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
when you're disabled
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then of course you qualify for
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
medicare when you turn 65.
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
there are rating rules that we approve
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
that the premiums
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire has what's referred to
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
as an issue age so
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
the problem seems to be that some people
 
01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.109 align:start position:0%
the problem seems to be that some people
who

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
qualified being disabled weren't
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
notified that they had another open
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment period when they turned 65
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
continued to be charged the higher
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
disabled premium
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then complained to the department
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
when they found out they should have had
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to get a lower premium
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
so this very simple bill just addresses
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
those people when they turn 65
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
provides that regulatory clarity we
 
01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:40.950 align:start position:0%
provides that regulatory clarity we
actually

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh surveyed the carriers to find out
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
what they were doing
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
and one of the carriers a major player
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the market said
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
we would never continue to charge that
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
disabled rate when somebody turned 65
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's illegal so clearly um one way or
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
another the regulatory clarity would be
 
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
another the regulatory clarity would be
helpful

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
that being said there does seem to be a
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
lot of support for acknowledging the
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
fact that when somebody who's disabled
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
turns 65
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
they qualify for that that regular 65
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
premium that would be in place um so i'm
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you seems pretty
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
straightforward to me
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you very much okay so
 
01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.349 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you very much okay so
attorney

01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
fox you're going to wrap up the other
 
01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:23.589 align:start position:0%
fox you're going to wrap up the other
three

01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
three yeah okay my name is james fox i'm
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
the pnc director at the new hampshire
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for having me i think uh
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
since we have all three maybe i'll go in
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
reverse order so
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
this so i'll go back to self storage um
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
the self storage bill we were i would
 
01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:41.990 align:start position:0%
the self storage bill we were i would
say

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
in my opinion very heavily involved in
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
the drafting of that
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and for those of you know the
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
the biggest license you can have in
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
state of hampshire produces is is the
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
402j that's our full license uh you can
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
sell homeowners insurance
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
any type of insurance if you have that
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
line so that that's our our big
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
um producer license and under that we
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
have these limited licenses for what
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
i think really lesser products and this
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
is self storage and then it allows
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
self storage facilities to in essence be
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
able to sell the product with an insurer
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
sitting above them
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
um now in this one we were uh a little
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
more concerned because it is personal
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
property you can have quite a bit of
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
personal property in your storage
 
01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:22.150 align:start position:0%
personal property in your storage
facility

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
so we may we put some things in place
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
that aren't really in the
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
other limited lines like there it has to
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
be training um and we have
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
to approve the training we limited it to
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
the ten thousand dollars so we didn't
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to have large
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
value policies that you weren't going to
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
a 402 j producer
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
um and we did look at it was mentioned
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
all 40 states we looked at all
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much all 40 states to try to pick
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
out the best
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
pieces of each state um for consumer
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
protection so all we're going to look at
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
all the forms
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be form approval as a
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
training approval
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i would say uh of the lines this is
 
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.510 align:start position:0%
and i would say uh of the lines this is
probably

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
um the most regulated of the limited
 
01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:05.270 align:start position:0%
um the most regulated of the limited
lines

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that the the commissioner also
 
01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
personally reviewed this one and he's
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
very comfortable
 
01:04:12.789 --> 01:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
um that it is sufficiently consumed
 
01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:13.910 align:start position:0%
um that it is sufficiently consumed
protective

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
protective
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
um that we can let it go forward so i'm
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions about it
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then maybe then i'll move up to
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
travel since it's related
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
now travel insurance again is a limited
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
line the travel insurance law
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
402 l is already in place
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
and it's a much abbreviated version
 
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
now in new hampshire it's a little
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
unusual because we have a abbreviated
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
limited alliance license for travel
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
insurance and then
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
under that we have a very extensive rule
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
so when we were brought the neic model
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
what several of our attorneys uh did was
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
they basically made sure because we
 
01:04:58.390 --> 01:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
think our rule is working well
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
that the neic model we put in place was
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
consistent with the rule
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
so in essence you have the expanded
 
01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:06.150 align:start position:0%
so in essence you have the expanded
protections

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
protections
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
as to defining the exact rules all the
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
parties involved the travel agency
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
the education that's required what's
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to allow to be done what's not
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to be done
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
what disclosures need to be put in place
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
so a lot of that's new and it's
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's more let's call it consumer
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
friendly and then also underneath that
 
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have our very extensive rule on how
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
the insurance is supposed to work
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
so again based upon our input um we're
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
very comfortable that this
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
is at the right level of consumer
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
protection for this name peril
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
type of policy and as always uh if
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
you know we get some complaints and
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
something's not working out correctly
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back and tweak it but
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of work was put into making sure
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
and versus uh and the statute will work
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
well together and
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh i would say it's uh much more
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
protective for consumers than the old
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
much more revealed any questions
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay and the last one um
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
is again an naic model it's the domestic
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh investment uh law this is again so
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
that this is what applies to our
 
01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:15.589 align:start position:0%
that this is what applies to our
domestic

01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
domestic
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire based insurance
 
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.630 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire based insurance
companies

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
and it allows them as was mentioned what
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
we did basically is take the old law
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
which is very abbreviated as derivative
 
01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.309 align:start position:0%
which is very abbreviated as derivative
transactions

01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
and remove that and our director of
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
financial regulation
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
doug bartlett worked very extensively on
 
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.190 align:start position:0%
doug bartlett worked very extensively on
putting

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
putting
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
taking the neic model and putting that
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
in place which is a much more detailed
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
model and what you're allowed and not
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to do as to investments
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
and one of the big things it does again
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
is to allow replication transactions
 
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:44.870 align:start position:0%
is to allow replication transactions
which

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know for us more lay people that
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
just allows the insurance company to
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
replicate something
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
um in a synthetic way that they're
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
already allowed to do so it's not
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
something that they weren't allowed to
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
do it's something that basically they've
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
always done and they're just replicating
 
01:06:59.119 --> 01:06:59.589 align:start position:0%
always done and they're just replicating
it

01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh and again our from our position is
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
you know the naic model so that's the
 
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
national association insurance
 
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
national association insurance
commissioners

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
um and that's in all 50 states
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
and this makes it 11 level playing field
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
so liberty mutual asks for this so we'd
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
want to make sure
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire uh liberty mutual
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
with our oversight regulation to make
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
sure for solvency is able to do
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and be competitive with insurance
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
companies in other states so
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's all that the goal of that
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
particular section
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
was to accomplish
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh doug bartlett you know senator
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
bartlett is also here if they say you
 
01:07:42.799 --> 01:07:43.430 align:start position:0%
bartlett is also here if they say you
really

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
just like to know about replication
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
transactions because right
 
01:07:57.270 --> 01:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
first okay um
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
i don't anyway it's okay i'll
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
i can't talk i don't know where the echo
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
is coming from
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay i i think the echo was me i just
 
01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.029 align:start position:0%
okay i i think the echo was me i just
okay

01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's okay now so you're on would you
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%

trying to be facetious with this
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
question but i'm wondering if you have
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
had any
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
travel insurance companies go out of
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
business in the past year
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh not that i'm aware of uh certainly
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
not insurance companies that i'm aware
 
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.709 align:start position:0%
not insurance companies that i'm aware
of

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
thanks very much i'm sure there's plenty
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
of claims
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
well all i can say is uh to for me to
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
get into the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
british virgin islands i had to buy
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
travel insurance which i've never bought
 
01:10:38.719 --> 01:10:39.510 align:start position:0%
travel insurance which i've never bought
before

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
and they did give a list of companies
 
01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
that are are available and there were
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
six different companies and i think i
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
went with the shurian
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
because i knew the name but uh but so
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a very lively
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
market in that business so all right uh
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:53.750 align:start position:0%
market in that business so all right uh
having

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
no more questions and no more hints i
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
think we're all set we can close the
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 124 we had 16 in support
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
no opposition and two neutral which i
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
believe are insurance department people
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll end that public
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
hearing and now
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the last but not least
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
our favorite subject beer
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
he is the chairman um but anyways
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
so i talked with your chairman yesterday
 
01:12:14.159 --> 01:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
so i talked with your chairman yesterday

01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
um i felt much like my kids when they
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
come home from junior higher high school
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
with their paper and that's me and they
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
thought they knew everything on a
 
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
thought they knew everything on a
subject

01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
and i learned humbly that um it's
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
some things aren't your wheelhouse and
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
what seems very easy
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
isn't always as easy as it seems so i
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate senator hunt's
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
patience with me don't don't don't know
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
me representative hunt
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative um so anyways
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you why i started the bill
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
where we're out with it so
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
um and i had no real knowledge outside
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
of drinking and enjoying beer
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
till december of this uh last year so
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
the no microbrewers everyone came to me
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
and they said
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh here's an industry that generates 506
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
helps our tourist industry i'm watching
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
people go from vineyard to vineyard
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm like wow this is great we can
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
have the same thing going you know
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
tourists coming up i have one a mile
 
01:13:10.950 --> 01:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
from me uh
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's called what is it called zurbino
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
vineyards and they are packed
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
seven days a week in the summer and i'm
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
like wouldn't this be a good thing for
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
every town that has a small nano brewery
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
a micro brewery
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
and again providing 4 700 jobs
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
the average pay is 42 000 we're all
 
01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
about the new hampshire advantage
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
seemed like a total no-brainer to me but
 
01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
then you get into the weeds
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
as senator hunt knows and there's a long
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
history with the bill
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh not just that the whole industry has
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
much much more detail than i know
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
but i'll give you my summary of it and
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
we'll go from there um
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i introduced the bill after i said
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
geez let's spread more jobs in new
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire sounds like a great idea
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so the bill is intended sought to
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
simplify the statutes governing the
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
craft beer industry
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
to enable more competitive with the
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding states bring more businesses
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
in and help our local breweries
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
the senate committee we testified in our
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
committee first
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
and the original bill would have had an
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
indeterminate effect on the liquor
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
commission's three-tier system which
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
consists of manufacturers wholesalers
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
and resellers so we amended the bill
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think i talked to probably all 92
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
micro brewers nano brewers
 
01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so we amended it we talked to the
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
liquor commission the wholesalers the
 
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.030 align:start position:0%
liquor commission the wholesalers the
craft

01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
craft
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
brewers and then it came what we came
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
out with then was
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
um we tried not to fundamentally alter
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
the three-tier system
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
instead we just tried to increase the
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
amount of beverages allowed to be sold
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
at a manufacturer's facility permit the
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
nano brewers and the brew pubs to
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
contract brew
 
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
and allow for interstate shipment of
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
specialty beers
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and permit beverage manufacturers and
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
licensees to have a retail outlet
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
just one besides where they make their
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
main manufacturing
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
and to sample produce much like lebel
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
brewer is doing
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
near by me in hampstead they're having a
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
satellite uh winery and
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have to make the product
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
there uh they can just
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
um have like a sampling room to spread
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
their product so
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
the idea was you if you were brewing up
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh somewhere far up town i don't want to
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
insult anyone say the town's far and
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
we'll just say like in berlin or
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere and you could have a satellite
 
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:20.790 align:start position:0%
somewhere and you could have a satellite
location

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth um you could spread your
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
your label you get people to come try a
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of your beer
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
and hopefully generate a buzz and get
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
your products sold
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
and again help helping new hampshire
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
businesses what we're all about
 
01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
um i have since talked to uh
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt and found out there's a
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
lot more to it than i probably
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
know and or will ever understand so i'm
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to defer to him in the committee
 
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
to explain where i may be off and i
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
think there are going to be people
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
testifying now after
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
me on both sides from manufacturers
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
distributors and they understand that
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
there's a 20-year history on this going
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
and so i would ask that you ask them the
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
questions i would
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
listen intently and try to bring myself
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
up from
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
a basic understanding to a higher
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
understanding listening to everyone's
 
01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.310 align:start position:0%
understanding listening to everyone's
testimony

01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
and i believe chairman hunt um may later
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
have an amendment which he thinks covers
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of these issues and um i would ask
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
i can't try to answer questions but i
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
think um you'd be my your time would be
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
better spent
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with the people who really
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
understand the the ins and outs and the
 
01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
understand the the ins and outs and the
weeds

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
weeds
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
and that's it chairman thank you did the
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%

uh just to cover some of the things that
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
are in this and
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the commission has been working with
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
some members of the industry to help
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
fashion some of these changes
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned by senator gannon
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
and for those who would like to follow
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
along i can try to briefly address
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
the seven parts of this bill
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
section one uh removes some of the
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
limitations that has been put in place
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of uh limiting the
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
quantities that
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
a consumer can buy at a beverage
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's facility
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
we thought that was a an easy change
 
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
we thought that was a an easy change
that

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
would bring about some opportunities for
 
01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.270 align:start position:0%
would bring about some opportunities for
consumers

01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
sections two three
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
and four are
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill which essentially are
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
contract brewing that
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
will allow nanobrewers and brewpubs to
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
engage in contract brewing now
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh senator excuse me sections two three
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
and four
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
have already been amended and this the
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
language that you see in this bill is
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
the exact language
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
that appears in the amendment to senate
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill 17
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
brought by senator sherman so it appears
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
in two places you see
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see it here in this bill and it
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
also appears
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
as an amendment in senate bill 17 which
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the committee has already taken up your
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
committee has already taken up
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative fund
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
for its first introduction so you may be
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
seeing that again
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
section five is a section that deals
 
01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
intra-state shipment of alcohol
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
as you know senate bill excuse me rsa
 
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
as you know senate bill excuse me rsa
178

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
178
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
27 is a bill that was
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
passed long ago to allow for businesses
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
who were licensed out of the state of
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
to obtain permits to ship products into
 
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
and section 5
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
would allow and create the language as
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
well as the
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
labeling and reporting requirements
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
for businesses who are licensed within
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
the state to ship to consumers
 
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
located within new hampshire and
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh so there that process and again it's
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh what is important i think for the
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee to know
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
is that the permits that would be part
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
are not subject to fees we're not going
 
01:20:40.719 --> 01:20:41.590 align:start position:0%
are not subject to fees we're not going
to

01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
ask the legislature to impose any
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
additional fees to
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
obtain the right to ship within the
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
section 6 deals with
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
what i guess is commonly been referred
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
to as satellite locations
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
um i think it is important to note that
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
on line 18 on page four
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill you'll see the word uh
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the sentence retail
 
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.189 align:start position:0%
at the end of the sentence retail
outlets

01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh this certainly would appear to
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
be authorizing um if this were to become
 
01:21:24.159 --> 01:21:24.950 align:start position:0%
be authorizing um if this were to become
law

01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer to obtain
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
more than one retail outlet
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
and we felt that that certainly
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
and section 7 creates a new definition
 
01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.149 align:start position:0%
and section 7 creates a new definition
of

01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer retail outlet
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
and again we've kind of framed this in
 
01:21:46.239 --> 01:21:46.629 align:start position:0%
and again we've kind of framed this in
the

01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the in the phrase of a satellite
 
01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the in the phrase of a satellite
location

01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
which would allow a beverage
 
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.590 align:start position:0%
which would allow a beverage
manufacturer

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then the terms that are contained
 
01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
and then the terms that are contained
within

01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
this definition are conditions precedent
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
to getting the satellite location
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
and it should be brought to your
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
attention that
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
the way this statute is constructed that
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
a beverage
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer who would be seeking a
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
satellite location
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
would need to manufacture product
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
at the site of that retail location in
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
so uh mr chairman that's our assessment
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
of uh senate bill 125 as amended in the
 
01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:32.629 align:start position:0%
of uh senate bill 125 as amended in the
senate

01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
from committee members
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative weston you have a
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
question nope
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr moore for taking my
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
question as you mentioned we are
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with the main part of
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
this because of
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
sb17 and there's uh there are a couple
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
figures in there that have confused me
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
all along um which refer
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
to the the maximum amount that can be
 
01:23:13.910 --> 01:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
produced by a nano brewer and a brew pub
 
01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering why those two amounts
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
are not the same
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
a nano brewer is limited to um
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah 2500 and why are they different uh
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative um i can tell you the
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the brewpub uh preceded the uh
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
nanobrewers as far as its capacity it
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
was rather a new creation that kind of
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
came a number of years ago um with the
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
a restaurant that is interested in
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
brewing its own beer for its customers
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to do so
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm going to guess well in excess
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
of probably 20 25 years ago
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
the capacity of 2500 was placed in that
 
01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.430 align:start position:0%
the capacity of 2500 was placed in that
statute

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
i think for uh the nanos i was i was not
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
present for working with the commission
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
but i think the idea is that the 2000 is
 
01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:16.470 align:start position:0%
but i think the idea is that the 2000 is
a

01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable level for what would probably
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
be referred to as an incubator business
 
01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
a business that's looking to start up
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
and that if they were to exceed that
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
they would then move on to the next
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
classification of
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
license which would be a beverage
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's license
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
so um i can't speak to the historical
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
reason why those numbers are there but
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would i believe appear to me to be
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
why they
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
exist the way they do representative
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
there is an order here okay
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett is next
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um mr moore could
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know that we're dealing with these
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
omnibus bills and
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
um senate bill 17 has two parts of it
 
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.550 align:start position:0%
um senate bill 17 has two parts of it
and

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
would you be able to clarify for us that
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
125 includes everything that's
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
in 17 on the second part
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes that that was uh
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
i believe the intent when this came
 
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.310 align:start position:0%
i believe the intent when this came
across

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
um is that when senate bill 17 was
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
amended by senator sherman
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
to add this language dealing with
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
senator birdsell to amend the bill
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
which he consented to and it was amended
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
we worked with the
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
senator and the industry to make sure
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
that that language was
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
tight and it was reintroduced
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
into senate bill excuse me senate bill
 
01:25:48.639 --> 01:25:51.189 align:start position:0%
into senate bill excuse me senate bill
125

01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
125
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
as the industry sought to again have
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
privilege included in in its in this
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
legislation so we've we've duplicated it
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
but i can confirm that to you
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:06.830 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
representative

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you mr moore i'm
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
going to ask the question that i've
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
asked a couple of times as we've heard
 
01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:15.030 align:start position:0%
asked a couple of times as we've heard
um

01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
liquor bills uh the three-tier system
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
in my opinion seems to be perhaps the
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
word is too strong but unraveling in
 
01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
some ways
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
um are we better to better off to just
 
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.430 align:start position:0%
um are we better to better off to just
maybe

01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:26:29.110 --> 01:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
establish a commission or something of
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
that sort to look at the skeleton
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the three-tier system to be sure that
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
we are not destroying it by bits and
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
pieces and i do respect your
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
your you need to not be uh partisan here
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh to to have some neutrality but are we
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
in general eroding the system
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
in some ways thank you for your
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
um i i think that
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
each year and for those of you who have
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
been members of the general court for a
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
number of years you've seen bills come
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
each year and
 
01:27:03.669 --> 01:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
it oftentimes is not clear what the
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
impact of that legislation will be
 
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.870 align:start position:0%
impact of that legislation will be
immediately

01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
one might think it's clear but it does
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
change the dynamic and i think the
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
not that every system needs to be static
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
and never change
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly over the course of my time
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
working for the state of new hampshire
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
a dramatic change in this area but i
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
also think
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
and i think probably most everyone who
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
has an interest in this area would agree
 
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.189 align:start position:0%
has an interest in this area would agree
that

01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
there needs to be balance and that the
 
01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:35.030 align:start position:0%
there needs to be balance and that the
process

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be complex and
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of interlocking pieces
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
and when
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
you are at the cusp of potentially
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
making some significant change it
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
is i believe critical to um
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
look at the long-term effects and ask
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
how is this change going to affect other
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the system so to the extent
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
that you've described representative
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
the need to kind of examine things in a
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
very global sense
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
i think that would uh that makes a great
 
01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
i think that would uh that makes a great
sense

01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay all set uh representative
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
mclaren uh thank you mr chairman mr
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
moore i
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard something that was a
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
little bit uh
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
contradictory um first off i think
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
i heard that we could have a brewery
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
could have one satellite
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
you said something about more than one
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
well i'm thank you for your question
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
i i believe and again this may be a
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
scribner's error
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
but the way uh the
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
language is written on page four line
 
01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:48.390 align:start position:0%
language is written on page four line
eighteen

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
eighteen
 
01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
it could be interpreted that uh the word
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
outlets is plural
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
and that the and that the intent made to
 
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:56.709 align:start position:0%
and that the and that the intent made to
have

01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
baby to have one satellite location but
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written it could be
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
very reasonably interpreted to be more
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
i think he's pointing out that it needs
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
to be amended to have that fixed
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay and a follow-up um i
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
thought you also said that the satellite
 
01:29:15.199 --> 01:29:15.669 align:start position:0%
thought you also said that the satellite
uh

01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
facility would have to brew as well and
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
i originally heard that
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
the satellite facility would not have to
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
have a brewing
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
situation can you clarify that well
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up question representative um i'm
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at the
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
language that is in the amendment
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
745 i don't know what future amendments
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
if any might bring
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
um in the way of changing that but the
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
way the
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
bill that is before your committee now
 
01:29:46.239 --> 01:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
bill that is before your committee now
reads

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
reads
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
um it does require a satellite location
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
or a
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer retail outlet to
 
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer retail outlet to
produce

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
produce
 
01:29:59.189 --> 01:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
product on-site to be eligible to hold
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
so again this is another item that needs
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be amended and fixed
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
to clarify this all right representative
 
01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
to clarify this all right representative
abel

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you um thank
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
you mr moore
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
um uh my question
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh involves the ability
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
of the liquor commission to
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh keep track of what's brewed
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
and what uh what's what's sold
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
um so that um
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
revenue that that's due to the due to
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
is is um is adequately uh accounted for
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
and collected
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
is there any any problem with that at
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
all in this
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh certainly the the
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
commission takes its
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh responsibilities to audit and
 
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:08.870 align:start position:0%
uh responsibilities to audit and
maintain

01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh proper reporting as part of its
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
duties to ensure uh the revenue owed the
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
state is collected
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
it is a i will say a challenge we try to
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
keeping up with that as the laws change
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and the reporting of the licensees who
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
are required to file taxes
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
um is maintained and current
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
so when when we see some of these
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh changes you know we always try to
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
look at that and that's always part of
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
our fiscal worksheets that we provide if
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
we see anything that
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
we feel is going to have a fiscal impact
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
but i don't see any anything in this
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative that
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
i would say would necessitate or cause
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
us to
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
have any significant budgetary
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
challenges um
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
and and again that may change if if the
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill is amended further
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
um but at this point in time i think i
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
think we seem to be prepared to handle
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
great uh representative emin has a
 
01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
great uh representative emin has a
question

01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
my question uh is it true that
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
the satellite facilities would have to
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
be for a
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
single brewer or
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
or vineyard that they cannot combine
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
resources and create
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
a satellite retail space that
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
sold multiple producers
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
products is that correct uh thank you
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
for your question representative and i
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
would say your
 
01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
your answer your your question is
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
correct that the way the bill is drafted
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer would
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
be able to have a satellite location and
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
only sell their products they could not
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
sell anybody else's products
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
see no more questions then i guess
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
we'll move on so i'll call up kirsten
 
01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
we'll move on so i'll call up kirsten

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
and who is in support of the bill
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
and she's from tuckerman brewing
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
hi committee members uh thank you for
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking the time to hear me
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm kirsten nebs i'm co-founder of
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
tuckerman brewing company and i'm also
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
vice president of the new hampshire
 
01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
brewers association
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i support sb 125 we opened tuckerman
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
brewing company in 1998 and in 23 years
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
significant change in the craft brewing
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
industry in new hampshire when we opened
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
people would mainly come to the brewery
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
to take tours and maybe have a quick
 
01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:48.629 align:start position:0%
to take tours and maybe have a quick
sample

01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
sample
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
and if we were lucky we would we could
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
convince them to buy a six-pack on their
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
way out
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
but hardly anybody took us up on it um
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
and over the last two decades we've
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
watched as brewery tasting rooms have
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
become increasingly popular with locals
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
and tourists
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
and tasting rooms have become an
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
integral part of the communities that
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're located in
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
our customers are from all walks of life
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
locations and age groups and our tasting
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
room serves as a community meeting place
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
for everyone
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately over the years the
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
licensing and regulations pertaining to
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire breweries has not kept
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
pace with the brewing industry
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
other states around us have had far
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
fewer restrictions and regulations on
 
01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.270 align:start position:0%
fewer restrictions and regulations on
breweries

01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
breweries
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
and they're able to offer their
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
customers a more fluid and comfortable
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
tasting room experience
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire breweries want to keep
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
up the pace of the ever-evolving growing
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
industry we need to be able to work
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
without the burdens of over-regulation
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
sb-125 takes steps towards allowing new
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire breweries to compete with
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
breweries and
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring new england states sba 125
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
would help our particular business by
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
eliminating the one case per person per
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
day limit on what we can sell
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
to customers for offsite uh consumption
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's extremely
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
confusing to try to explain to customers
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
especially from tourists from out of
 
01:34:58.639 --> 01:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
especially from tourists from out of
state

01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
it would also allow us to have a
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
satellite location in a more heavily
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
trafficked area of our town
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
our brewery is located in industrial
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
park and our customers have to really
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
seek us out to find us
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
also if we could open a satellite
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
location we could open in a
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
in a different part of the state that
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the seasonal fluctuation
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
fluctuations that we do in the north
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
country um
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
also important of a satellite location
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to introduce
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
varieties of
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
our products that can't be sold in
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
stores there's tremendous competition
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
for shelf space
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
in retail and chain stores and also a
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
lot of the beers that we brew
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
have special instructions for
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
refrigeration and handling
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
that only a brewer could explain to a
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
customer or would possibly want to
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
explain to a customer
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
we have 13 beers on draft right now in
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
our tasting room and only six of those
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
are distributed through our distributors
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
and that's because of those reasons and
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
also on behalf of my role as the vice
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
president of the nhva
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
sva sp 125 would help our members in a
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
number of ways
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
it would allow contract brewing to be
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
performed by a beverage manufacturer for
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
any brewery license type
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
currently a beverage manufacturer can
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
only contract room for another beverage
 
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.629 align:start position:0%
only contract room for another beverage
manufacturer

01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh sb 125 would also allow new hampshire
 
01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:16.149 align:start position:0%
uh sb 125 would also allow new hampshire
breweries

01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
breweries
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
direct shipped to customers in new
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire currently only out of state
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
breweries are allowed to direct ship to
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which is a great
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
disadvantage to our breweries uh svi
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
sp 125 would allow craft breweries of
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
any size to have satellites so
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
satellite locations which would bring
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
parity with new hampshire wineries who
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
are allowed to have
 
01:36:36.149 --> 01:36:36.159 align:start position:0%
satellite locations regardless of their
 
01:36:36.159 --> 01:36:37.830 align:start position:0%
satellite locations regardless of their
size

01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
size
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
also i would like to read a statement
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
from ariel moe who is co-founder of
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
stone face brewing and treasurer of the
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire brewers association and
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
errol says that he has surmised that the
 
01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
state will
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
realize incremental tax revenue of one
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
hundred to one hundred fifty thousand
 
01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
dollars if just
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
five to ten percent of beverage
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers chose chose to open a
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
satellite location
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh that option creates growth
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our small businesses
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
and translates into new jobs across
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
geographic regions
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for hearing me
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
out and please let me know if you have
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
we do have a question representative
 
01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.229 align:start position:0%
we do have a question representative

01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
burrows
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes kirsten thanks for taking my
 
01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.270 align:start position:0%
yes kirsten thanks for taking my
question

01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm just confused because i'm i'm
 
01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm just confused because i'm i'm
reading

01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
um some of the verbiage on page four of
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i've been to tuckerman's in conway
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
um you do a lot of great things for
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
her charities etc do you have a limit on
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of um
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
amount of servings you can have in that
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry uh the sb 125 doesn't really
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
pertain to the pint limits it pertains
 
01:37:51.199 --> 01:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
pertain to the pint limits it pertains
to

01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
off-premise cons off-premise sales
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
so what sp sp 125 tries to fix is uh
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes to the brewery and
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
wants to buy some beer to go
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can only buy one case or one keg
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
per person per day
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay so this wouldn't limit how much you
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
serve in the conway facility
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
no it wouldn't address the plant limits
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's a separate statute that relates
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
to that that's all right because i see
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
people sitting there a long time that
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
would have surprised me thank you
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay any other questions from
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you very much all
 
01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.149 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you very much all
right

01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
now for the other side of mike summers
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant and hospitality uh good
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
tuning in to speak to you for the record
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
my name is mike summers i'm the
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
president ceo of the new hampshire
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
lodging and restaurant association
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
and for the most part this bill we don't
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
really have a concern with i think the
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
one thing that has
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
been touched on a couple of times in
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
testimony are the satellite locations
 
01:38:55.199 --> 01:38:56.070 align:start position:0%
testimony are the satellite locations
and

01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
as i understood in the initial days of
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
this bill the intent was to have one
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
satellite location
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
per brewery which you know we could
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
probably live with that
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
but again uh through the um amendment
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
process we ended up with this version
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
which um
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
i think i'm in agreement with uh former
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
chief moore
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the way it's written right now
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately a brewery could have you know
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
10 15 or more locations
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh which would create a concern for the
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
industry for us for the restaurant
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
industry because now we're essentially
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know beer bars with no food
 
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
requirements competing potentially next
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
door to our restaurants that have all
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
the food requirements and all the other
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
overhead that
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
is required to be carried based on our
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
licensing structure so
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
that really is our concern and again it
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's some
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
potentially some discussion within the
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
committee that this may be amended in
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
which case
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh we would probably withdraw our uh
 
01:39:46.239 --> 01:39:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh we would probably withdraw our uh
rejec

01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
rejec
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
concerns but i just wanted to flag that
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
and certainly i'm happy to try to answer
 
01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
um we'll absolutely have an amendment
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
for this bill and yes it will
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh mr chairman thank
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
um what's uh do you recall what page in
 
01:40:17.109 --> 01:40:17.119 align:start position:0%
line the
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
provision says that they are allowed to
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
have unlimited number of
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't specifically say
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited but there's no restriction on
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
it either it doesn't
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
say anywhere that there is a limit to it
 
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.310 align:start position:0%
say anywhere that there is a limit to it
so

01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
i think by extension and i'm again i'm
 
01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
no attorney so i would certainly defer
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
to an attorney
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
but i my understanding would be that uh
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
there would be no restriction on it
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
just it's the word there's a plural word
 
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
it says outlets
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
and that having a plural s implies more
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
for the question may inquire um
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
and what do you think would be a
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable limit for this particular
 
01:40:55.679 --> 01:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
reasonable limit for this particular
bill

01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh again i think our understanding when
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
they first came when this bill first
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
came forward
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
um that the intent was to have one per
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
brewery which okay we could live with
 
01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.189 align:start position:0%
brewery which okay we could live with
that

01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:09.990 --> 01:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
so if you're a brewery in say lincoln
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire maybe you have a location
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth or whatever
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh the example used earlier but
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately the way it's currently
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
drafted you could have one in portsmouth
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
one in manchester one in nashua one in
 
01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:23.350 align:start position:0%
one in manchester one in nashua one in
concord

01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
essentially and this would apply for
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
every single brewery so now we could
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a situation where
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
we could have a beer bar in every corner
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
competing with you know the legitimate
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you i can
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
assure your concerns will be addressed
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay and let's see who else uh let's see
 
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
okay and let's see who else uh let's see
another

01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me okay yes good morning
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt and members of the
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
scott shire and i'm the director of the
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire beer distributors
 
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.669 align:start position:0%
new hampshire beer distributors
association

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
and uh we're neutral on this right now
 
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
um as presented we're generally
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
supportive of the bill
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
anything that advances the goals of our
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire brewer partners and the
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
industry in general
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
especially sort of mirroring that
 
01:42:29.590 --> 01:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
on-premise on brewery experience that
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
people can
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
can have in neighboring states of maine
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
or vermont or massachusetts
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
is generally good like uh like mike
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
summers and
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
and some of the others we do have some
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with the satellite location
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
or locations um and also the production
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
requirement but
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now we're supportive
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
of of the bill
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
and uh eager to work with the committee
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
on on any amendments that are
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
coming forward so uh i'd open up the
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
questions too and uh and thanks for your
 
01:42:58.239 --> 01:43:00.310 align:start position:0%
questions too and uh and thanks for your
attention

01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
yeah uh thank you very much for taking
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh basically the same question did you
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
need just one satellite location or
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
do you have uh some businesses that
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
would need some breweries that would
 
01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.070 align:start position:0%
would need some breweries that would
need

01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
you know more than that they need two
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
for example just
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal or what have you yeah i think
 
01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking i think one is
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
probably a reasonable amount
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know given the size of our our
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
geography or size of our state
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
that probably would suffice and i think
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
so obviously one was what we did with uh
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
the wine the wine producer
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
and the argument somewhat is that um
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
you're if you where you're manufacturing
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh zoning is such that it you might not
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
really lend itself to being a retail
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
type location where people come in and
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
take something in and so the idea
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
one is that you could divide your
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
business in the sense that you would
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
a manufacturing facility that's in a
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured zoning or you don't think
 
01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:07.430 align:start position:0%
manufactured zoning or you don't think
that's

01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know warehouse type environment but
 
01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:10.719 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted to have
 
01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
your actual retail arrangement to be in
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
a place that is
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
more conducive for consumers
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you scott and let's see
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh dennis molnar molnar
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
and uh is dennis on
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
are you done oh there you are okay all
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:50.310 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
and still good morning
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can hi everyone
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for your time this morning
 
01:45:01.590 --> 01:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
my name is dennis molnar and i'm the
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
co-owner with my wife of concord craft
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
brewing company
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
um on a normal year in normal session
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're just a few blocks away from where
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
you folks regularly meet
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
um and i just think
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
that uh part of my testimony um really
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the adventures we've had over
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
the last year or so with kovid
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
um i'll say i am in support of the bill
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
and the various provisions
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
including um one satellite for
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh for all breweries of of any size
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i think our experiences over covid
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
really showed that
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
um having the ability to um
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
optimize and uh react to
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
these kinds of challenges really was
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
very important for our business
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
right before covid hit we were in
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
discussions with the liquor commission
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
it looks like
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
at least at least a year ago that we
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
were the largest producing
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
nano brewery in the state we produced
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
about 1800 barrels in 2019
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
and even last year and so we've been in
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
discussions with the state to move to
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
a beverage manufacturer and so
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
a bill that better aligns some of the
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
different rules and regulations for
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
moving from um i think as it was said an
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
innovator or
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
um um a brewery to
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
to one that's a larger business would be
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
very helpful to us
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
um but when kovid did hit we were in dis
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
we we have two distribution partners
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the state so we certainly use and
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
take advantage of
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
the three-tier system and when kovitt
 
01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
the three-tier system and when kovitt
hit

01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
hit
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
um we were distributing to about 300
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
different retail outlets in about 200
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
different restaurants and bars
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
various uh of our products and
 
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh the day after cove it hit um the
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
distribution went down to about zero
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
and um for about two months uh in
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
addition to taking back
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh kegs of draft beer from uh
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants and bars throughout the
 
01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:01.350 align:start position:0%
restaurants and bars throughout the
state

01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh we did expand um our ability to sell
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
from our tasting room in in downtown
 
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.229 align:start position:0%
from our tasting room in in downtown
concord

01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
and opened up delivery um and for
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
several months we sold more from our
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
tasting room than we did the 500
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
outlets that we had previously sold uh
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
our products through
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
and the ability to ship within the state
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to sell more than one case
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the ability to have a second
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
satellite location that doesn't require
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands of investment
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
in order to make quality
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
production would really be helpful for
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
businesses like ours that are trying to
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
move from being
 
01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
a small family business to a business
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit more sustainable
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we employ four
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and 12
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
part-time employees and uh things go
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
well this year will produce about
 
01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh 500 000 um pints of beer
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
and um just these changes in this
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill would really help other
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
companies who are trying to make the
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
transition from a little local
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
brewery to a statewide business
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
including through the three-tier system
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
and of distribution
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think it would really help other other
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
folks to do exactly what we've done
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
so big supporter of the bill and hope
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
you'll take that into consideration
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
testimony is there any questions from
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
committee members okay
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
saying none and last but not least
 
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh keith fry who is in
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill good morning
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
um ignore the ring phone in the
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
background of course that happens as
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
soon as i get online
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to um for the record my
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
name was kate fry from new futures
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and you know we we have
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
found this bill very confusing from the
 
01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:57.830 align:start position:0%
found this bill very confusing from the
beginning

01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have any issues necessarily
 
01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
we don't have any issues necessarily
with

01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
um you know making nano breweries more
 
01:49:04.239 --> 01:49:05.030 align:start position:0%
um you know making nano breweries more
competitive

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
certainly getting rid of the requirement
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
of what can be sold
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
but um i have to go back to what
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative van hooten said
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that we are slowly um dismantling the
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
three-tier system with every little move
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
like this and it it is concerning
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to hear that there'll be a
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
hundred to 150 million dollars in
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
additional revenue with each satellite
 
01:49:28.159 --> 01:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
additional revenue with each satellite
location

01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
but maybe we should take a look at that
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
as well and
 
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
none of this funding um proportionately
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh treatment recovery prevention of
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder so
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's great we're increasing revenues for
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
it but where is that going as far as
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
helping the people who are suffering
 
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:46.950 align:start position:0%
helping the people who are suffering
from

01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder um i agree as
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
well that
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
um with mike summers and um being more
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
as far as the concern about the retail
 
01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:57.669 align:start position:0%
as far as the concern about the retail
outlets

01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
um and i do have a big concern about
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
expanding the interest date
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
um delivery for um but it sounds like
 
01:50:06.239 --> 01:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
um delivery for um but it sounds like
basically

01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
all vendors um and would want to have
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
more information about that
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
so you know in this time where we're on
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
a committee hearing and we're here
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
immediately here there's going to be an
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
amendment a and yet
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
people really don't have access to
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
getting that amendment right away
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
um i would strongly suggest the
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
committee retain the bill
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
um i think there are some good pieces in
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
here but i just feel like
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
um this has been a moving target this
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill from the beginning
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
first it was going to get rid of the
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
food that it had something to do with
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
the food requirement then it didn't and
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
so it's just been really difficult to
 
01:50:41.679 --> 01:50:42.470 align:start position:0%
so it's just been really difficult to
follow

01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate the committee's time and
 
01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:45.750 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate the committee's time and
um

01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
again i would encourage committee
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
looking at retaining this bill
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you great
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none um so just when i got
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
through my list i didn't see their
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
two hands popped up so um and
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
and now we have three hands pop up no
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
maybe not okay uh so
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh i will call on andy day
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
and still good morning i mean
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
here we go sorry about that um
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
good morning um chairman hunt and
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee members um thank you all for
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
my name is andy day uh i own daydreaming
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
brewing company
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh meadow vineyards duare distilling uh
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
and a small restaurant cask and vine
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
located in downtown derry
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh i am in strong support of sb 125.
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
in this past week my partner and i have
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
secured just under 100 000
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
in investments to grow all three of
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
these businesses simultaneously
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
um and this is through personal loans
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
with citizens in the dairy community
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh a significant part of our business
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
plan moving forward
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh was focused on the idea that having a
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
satellite tasting room
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
my current tasting room is 14 by 10 feet
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh so certainly not a lot of guests can
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
fit here
 
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed property that we have in
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
mind is three times that with three
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
acres of land
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
so this obviously would allow us to uh
 
01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
provide a much richer experience
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh to our guests uh as well as
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
potentially grow the business ten times
 
01:52:36.239 --> 01:52:37.830 align:start position:0%
potentially grow the business ten times
over

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh given that the laws allow us um as a
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
winery to have a satellite tasting room
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
it seems only fair that breweries have
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
my brewery is currently a one barrel
 
01:52:49.270 --> 01:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
brew house which is 30 gallons at a time
 
01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
more or less
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
it's nano in size this expansion and
 
01:52:54.629 --> 01:52:54.639 align:start position:0%
growth will allow us to triple
 
01:52:54.639 --> 01:52:55.990 align:start position:0%
growth will allow us to triple
production

01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
production
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
with the addition of a satellite tasting
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
room uh
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
we'd be able to grow in a way that we
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise couldn't um so i i would very
 
01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
otherwise couldn't um so i i would very
much

01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
um like to encourage and and uh in
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
support of sb125
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
any questions to the committee members
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you very much
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh drew klein i
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
recently

01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
you there drew yeah i had to unmute
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
sorry for that um
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
testify i am
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh drew klein i'm president of the
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
josiah bartlett center for public policy
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to give you our take
 
01:53:42.750 --> 01:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
on the effect of
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
125 as we see it
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me in our view the laws that
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
regulate new hampshire craft breweries
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
ought to facilitate innovation
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
creativity experimentation and
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
economic growth if they're too rigid to
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
do that then the laws inevitably will
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
make it harder for entrepreneurs to
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
scale up their small businesses
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
or possibly even keep them alive looking
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
at sb 125
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that it does make some
 
01:54:09.589 --> 01:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
changes that will ease the regulatory
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
burden on these local businesses in ways
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
that will make it easier for them to
 
01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:14.470 align:start position:0%
that will make it easier for them to
thrive

01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
thrive
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
expand and make an even greater
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
contribution to the state's economy
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
we see four major changes in the law and
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'll just real quickly run through them
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
one sp 125 removes an entirely
 
01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:28.310 align:start position:0%
one sp 125 removes an entirely
unnecessary

01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
and economically dubious prohibition on
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
selling more than a single k
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
or 12 pack to a member of the general
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
public that existing prohibition simply
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
forces people to buy beer for social
 
01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
forces people to buy beer for social
gatherings

01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
gatherings
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
say you're going to have a wedding or a
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
backyard lawn party or something in the
 
01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.390 align:start position:0%
backyard lawn party or something in the
summer

01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
it forces you to go to grocers or other
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
retailers rather than to craft brewers
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't protect the public at all it
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
just shifts sales to other providers
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
typically to the out-of-state beer
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
producers that dominate supermarket
 
01:54:55.199 --> 01:54:56.310 align:start position:0%
producers that dominate supermarket
shelves

01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
shelves
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
number two sb 2125 removes an
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary prohibition on contract
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
brewing that again does nothing to
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
but which restricts nanobrewers and
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
brewpub's ability to provide additional
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
supply to meet growing demand
 
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
or to reach markets elsewhere in the
 
01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.950 align:start position:0%
or to reach markets elsewhere in the
state

01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
the bill removes an unnecessary
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition on
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
interstate shipping of alcoholic
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
beverages directly to consumers
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
all that existing prohibition does is
 
01:55:24.149 --> 01:55:24.159 align:start position:0%
force consumers to order from other
 
01:55:24.159 --> 01:55:25.109 align:start position:0%
force consumers to order from other
sources

01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
whether supermarkets or out-of-state
 
01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
suppliers by making it illegal for them
 
01:55:30.310 --> 01:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
to order
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
the same types of beverages directly
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
from in-state producers
 
01:55:35.750 --> 01:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
this prohibition again gives large
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state breweries and wineries a
 
01:55:39.189 --> 01:55:39.199 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage over
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire businesses removing it
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
would let new hampshire businesses offer
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
a delivery service
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
that consumers want and that's become
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
increasingly important as large segments
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the population
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
and economy have made permanent shifts
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
to remote work
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
so with fewer people commuting to an
 
01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:56.870 align:start position:0%
so with fewer people commuting to an
office

01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
demand for delivery has increased and
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's likely to remain strong
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
permanently it's unclear why the law
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
should let consumers order beer and wine
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
from supermarkets or from out-of-state
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
suppliers but prohibit them from
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
ordering beer and wine directly from new
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
and last sb-125 removes a prohibition of
 
01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:17.669 align:start position:0%
and last sb-125 removes a prohibition of
breweries

01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
breweries
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
creating a retail location separate from
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
the brewing facility itself
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
this bro this prohibition excuse me
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
again puts new hampshire breweries at a
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
there's no harm to the public and
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
letting a brewery establish a satellite
 
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
retail location separate from the
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
brewing facility
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
but because the state's population is so
 
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
heavily skewed to the south
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
we look at this and believe that ending
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
this prohibition would be a particular
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
help to the many brewers that are
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
located in the merrimack valley and
 
01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:44.870 align:start position:0%
located in the merrimack valley and
above

01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
above
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
so grocers as you probably everybody on
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
this committee knows
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
have very limited shelf space it's very
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
challenging for small breweries to
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
convince supermarkets to carry their
 
01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:54.070 align:start position:0%
convince supermarkets to carry their
products

01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
as an example one of my favorite
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
breweries is schilling
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
up in um the north country and uh
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
carried at any of my local supermarkets
 
01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
carried at any of my local supermarkets
um

01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:05.189 --> 01:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
and but they're an hour and 45 minutes
 
01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
away from my house so if they were able
 
01:57:07.199 --> 01:57:07.669 align:start position:0%
away from my house so if they were able
to

01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:09.510 --> 01:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
to have a satellite location in the
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state it'd be much
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
easier for me
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
to go get their products and again it's
 
01:57:14.639 --> 01:57:16.229 align:start position:0%
to go get their products and again it's
no

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:16.239 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
no threat or harm to the public i'm not
 
01:57:18.639 --> 01:57:19.270 align:start position:0%
no threat or harm to the public i'm not
sure

01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
why the provision there as i read it
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
does not include nano breweries or brew
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
pubs i'd just like to flag that to the
 
01:57:24.239 --> 01:57:25.669 align:start position:0%
pubs i'd just like to flag that to the
committee

01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to open a separate retail
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
location could be even more important
 
01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
to these smaller brewers it's easier
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
than ever now
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
for small brewer to find affordable
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
retail space in places like manchester
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
nashua and the seacoast
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
being prohibited from opening such a
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
space is an artificial constraint
 
01:57:44.070 --> 01:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
that really only hurts small businesses
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
that are trying to grow
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
with commercial real estate now prices
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
being really low
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's totally reasonable to believe that
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
a nano brewery or a brewpub
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
could easily find an affordable retail
 
01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:57.030 align:start position:0%
could easily find an affordable retail
space

01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
in a separate part of the state that
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
would allow them to reach a new market
 
01:58:02.790 --> 01:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's not clear why the law wouldn't
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
include them as well
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
in some we believe that sb25 would have
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
the effect of removing unneeded barriers
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
to small business growth
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
reducing some of the advantages that
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
large out-of-state brewers have over new
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire craft brewers right now
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
and increasing competition among brewers
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
which would be good for them
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
and good for consumers and one last
 
01:58:24.239 --> 01:58:25.830 align:start position:0%
and good for consumers and one last
point

01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i think this is important for
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
members of committee to think about
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
though craft brewing has exploded in the
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
past few decades
 
01:58:33.910 --> 01:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
beer consumption in the u.s has actually
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
declined slightly
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
in the last decade in other words the
 
01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
number of beer consumers
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
is not really growing it's actually
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
slightly shrinking
 
01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
so the changes included in sb-125
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
would not increase alcohol consumption
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
they instead would free new hampshire
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
brewers to compete on a more level
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
for the limited number of beer consumers
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
that do exist
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
and one last point on the
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
retail locations it's just again it's
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me what the
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
protection to the public would be by
 
01:59:09.599 --> 01:59:10.149 align:start position:0%
protection to the public would be by
limiting

01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
the retail locations to one per brewer
 
01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:13.510 align:start position:0%
the retail locations to one per brewer
or

01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting brewers from teaming up
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
and selling
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
their their wares together at a
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
particular retail location
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
the law really should be about
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
facilitating competition
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
and helping consumers and not protecting
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
one particular industry by
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantaging another
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
and uh happy to take questions if
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
anybody hasn't
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh evidently we do have questions
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
my question uh mr klein are you
 
01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.430 align:start position:0%
my question uh mr klein are you
representing

01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
are you representing uh yourself today
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
no as i said in the beginning i'm here
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
for the josiah bartlett center for
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and representative
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
burroughs has a question
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for taking my question
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
mr klein
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
um which is um these not being
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
not being um familiar with how the
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
industry works
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
um these craft brewers would you say
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
that these retail
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
um locations are a prime way for these
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
for these small
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
businesses to get word out about their
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
product given the difficulty
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
of getting them into supermarkets and
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
those types of retail outlets
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
yeah i think potentially that is true um
 
02:00:29.119 --> 02:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
yeah i think potentially that is true um
so

02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
one way to think about this is that so
 
02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
if you have a supermarket
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
if your market basket or hannaford or
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
shaw's or even one of the smaller
 
02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
shaw's or even one of the smaller
grocers

02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
grocers
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
you obviously have limited shelf space
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
and you want to maximize the
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
um product going off the shelf right so
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
you want to have something that
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
consumers already know that's why you
 
02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:48.229 align:start position:0%
consumers already know that's why you
sell

02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:00:50.470 --> 02:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
budweiser and the big name brands right
 
02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:51.270 align:start position:0%
budweiser and the big name brands right
so

02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
um if you're using some of that shelf
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
space for a totally unknown
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
nanobrewery you have to do a lot of your
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
own promotions so it's not it doesn't
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
make sense for you as the grocer
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
to um dedicate a lot of shelf space to
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
small breweries that customers don't
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
already know and that's one of the
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
reasons why it's so hard for a small
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
brewery to get that shelf space
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
so you've noticed i'm sure you guys have
 
02:01:15.270 --> 02:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
the number of beer stores that have
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
opened up in new hampshire over the last
 
02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:17.430 align:start position:0%
opened up in new hampshire over the last
decade

02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
decade
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
those also have very limited shelf space
 
02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:21.109 align:start position:0%
those also have very limited shelf space
so

02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
um so i think that's one of the reasons
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
why you would want to allow
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
these small breweries to open a
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
satellite location again as i mentioned
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
um commercial real estate rents have
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
dropped dramatically so
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not unreasonable to think
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
that a nano brewery
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
could open a retail location in the
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state if they're
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
located out west
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
or vice versa um you know if you're
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
located in the southern part of the
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
state a lot of good breweries in the
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
southern part of the state that might
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to open
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
a retail outlet in hanover for example
 
02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
or littleton and compete with the
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
breweries up there um i think the law
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
should facilitate that kind of
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
competition and not put artificial
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
restraints in front of it because when
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
you do that
 
02:02:03.510 --> 02:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you accomplish is
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
to just make it
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
harder for these small businesses to
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
scale up to hire more people
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
um and to grow their business and and i
 
02:02:13.030 --> 02:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
don't think the law should be making it
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
harder for them to do that should be
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
making it easier for them to do that
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there anyone else
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%

we have every year of meeting with the
legislators

02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
however i am here today to testify on
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%

new hampshire grocers association
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
the association is opposition is enough
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 125 relatives of the
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer licenses
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
as currently written the nhga represents
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
over 900 members in the state
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire from the small
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
independent mom-and-pop establishments
 
02:04:00.149 --> 02:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
to convenience stores to the large
 
02:04:00.159 --> 02:04:01.350 align:start position:0%
to convenience stores to the large
change-operated

02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
change-operated
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
supermarkets and most of those have
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensees
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
our membership also includes numerous
 
02:04:09.669 --> 02:04:09.679 align:start position:0%
categories of suppliers and
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
several craft beer and wine
 
02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.709 align:start position:0%
several craft beer and wine
manufacturers

02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
who's close to 1 000 full and part-time
 
02:04:16.159 --> 02:04:17.750 align:start position:0%
who's close to 1 000 full and part-time
employees

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
we want to highlight our concerns with
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
the senate amendment
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
which we believe creates several
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
and this is somewhat uh close to what
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
recently by mr moore and uh
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
and others uh from the industry first in
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
section six
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
page four line 18 it would allow
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers to create retail
 
02:04:41.199 --> 02:04:42.310 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers to create retail
outlets

02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
outlets
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
and off on-premise sales locations
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities as a concept
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
this would be similar to wineries which
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
are allowed
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
one retail outlet license
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
this language pluralizes outlets and
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
does not specify
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
each license would be only allowed one
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
retail outlet at minimum we believe this
 
02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:14.310 align:start position:0%
retail outlet at minimum we believe this
section

02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
should mirror what is in place in new
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire wineries
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be any more lenient than
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
what they have
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
we are also concerned with section 5 of
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
the bill which adds
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
quote importer wholesaler or retailer
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
to list of organizations that can direct
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
ship alcohol to consumers
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
as a direct conflict with the three-tier
 
02:05:35.199 --> 02:05:35.910 align:start position:0%
as a direct conflict with the three-tier
system

02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
and that was brought up earlier you know
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
should we be protecting the three-tier
 
02:05:39.199 --> 02:05:40.069 align:start position:0%
should we be protecting the three-tier
system

02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
we are very adamant that we need to
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
protect that for the safety
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
of the state for the consumers and the
 
02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:48.310 align:start position:0%
of the state for the consumers and the
retailers

02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
retailers
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
this could have been an unintended
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
influence corporations with large volume
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
buying capacity could create a system
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
where they could ship large volumes of
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol at lower prices
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
than local retailers this would add
 
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:02.629 align:start position:0%
than local retailers this would add
pressure

02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
pressure
 
02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
to small local businesses who are
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
already balancing competitive pressures
 
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
we believe that a much more appropriate
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
way to handle direct shipping
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
would be to limit the shipping of two
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers shipping their
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
own product this would allow consumers
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
access to increasing variety of products
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
not available at the local retailer
 
02:06:26.149 --> 02:06:26.159 align:start position:0%
while maintaining the system
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
no one can argue the rapid increase in
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
popularity and number of craft beer
 
02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:31.990 align:start position:0%
popularity and number of craft beer
options

02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
options
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
available to consumers as demand has
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
increased over the
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
last few years current methods of
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
distribution have continued to increase
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
the number of products widely available
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
maintaining the current three-tier
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
system is important
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
to ensuring consumer safety beverage
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and small brewing
 
02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:54.390 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and small brewing
facilities

02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
have thrived under the current system
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
offering significant
 
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
consumer choice while enjoying
 
02:07:03.109 --> 02:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
considerable flexibility
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
as the craft beer industry continues to
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
grow in size and complexity
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
it will be increasingly important to
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
maintain current checks and balances
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
that ensures quality and safety
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
standards across the state
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request that the bill be
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
amended to address
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
these concerns and look forward to
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%

02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%

questions from the committee members i
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%

02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
i don't see any more hands up uh and
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's 1209 so not too bad
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
given that we were an hour late or 10
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
minutes late uh
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
so for the committee members uh what i'm
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
thinking right now
 
02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
is that yes i have been working on an
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
amendment because i knew these issues
 
02:08:11.189 --> 02:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
were out there
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i have been looking at it and
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
reviewing it
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
my expectation is to send out that
 
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
everyone and certainly if anybody in the
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
public would like to have a copy of them
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
just send me an email and i will
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
forward once i have once i have it done
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
it will try to address all these some of
 
02:08:31.189 --> 02:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
these issues that have come up
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
um and i probably
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
um just for the sake of
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
forever i will probably next tuesday
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
will have a
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on the amendment so that no one
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
will ever say they didn't get a chance
 
02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:47.830 align:start position:0%
will ever say they didn't get a chance
to

02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
weigh in on it so um so let's plan
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
for next tuesday we'll have a uh we'll
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
first we'll have a hearing on the
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to 125
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
and then um in terms of executing
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
starting new exec bills
 
02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
um we're we're not under a lot of
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
pressure to exec bills at this point
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of you know when we
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
have the time we have the you know
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
almost the whole month of may but i
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily want to do that
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
but um as well i'll pick through and
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
see bills that i think that might be
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
easy to get started and i will of course
 
02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
easy to get started and i will of course
be

02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um talking uh to my minority leader
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
and letting her know what what we're
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
doing ahead of time and what we're what
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
we're what i
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
foresee going on um and theoretically
 
02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll know
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
right away if we're going to exact
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
something because there has to be
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
um come within the calendar it would
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
um stated that we're executing a bill so
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
so there'll be no surprises there
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
um but other than that we appreciate you
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
