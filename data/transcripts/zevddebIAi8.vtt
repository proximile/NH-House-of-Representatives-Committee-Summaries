Hampshire to send members of Our
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
National Guard to Texas to fac
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
facilitate security activities at the

Southern United States border to protect
 
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens from harm the
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
funds will enable the deployment of
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers from two New Hampshire uh two
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard military
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
police units totaling up to 15 soldiers
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
to deploy to Eagle Pass Texas for a
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
duration of up to 90 days so let me be
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
clear the crisis along the southern
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
border is not just a Texas issue it's an
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
issue that affects every state New
 
00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire included and it's one that if
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
left unaddressed will continue to
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
deliver harm for families across New
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire is fortunate to
 
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
have made Headway in recent years in
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
curbing the opioid crisis but the tragic
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
reality is that this year 400 families
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
will lose to loved one because of
 
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
fentanyl that is Flowing across our
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
Southern border record amounts of being
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
smuggled into our system since operation
 
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
lonar was launched by Governor Greg
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
Abbott in
 
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
2021 Texas alone uh their law
 
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement has seized over 450 million
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
lethal doses of
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in visiting with members of New
 
00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's National Guard stationed at
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
the border just this last year I saw
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand the humanitarian tragedy that
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
is unfolding the enaction of President
 
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
Biden is on Full display I've met with
 
00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
the men and women of border patrol who
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
want to do their job but who have been
 
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
told not to enforce laws that are
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
currently on the books simply P put the
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
southern border has devolved into a
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
corridor for the cartels to funnel
 
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and Other Drugs into this
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
country fueling an epidemic of overdoses
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
that that has absolutely ruined lives
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
including lives right here in the great
 
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire open borders
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
invite additional threats of terrorism
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
and human trafficking so since writing
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
to you earlier this week some have
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
questioned whether the use using State
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
funds for this manner is prudent others
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
have questioned whether State funds
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
should be on the table given that border
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
security typically falls to the federal
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
government members of this committee
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
have said that this is a federal issue
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
and not a state issue and I could not
 
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
agree more the president and his
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
administration have the tools to manage
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
this crisis in their hands today yet
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
they have done nothing which is why the
 
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
states are stepping up in the absence of
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
a willingness at the federal level to
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
secure our borderers states must under
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
undertake efforts to protect the safety
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
of our citizens and that's more than the
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration has done in three
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
years working in coordination with the
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
Texas National Guard and the Texas
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
department of safety the work done by
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer members of the New Hampshire
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
National Guard to enforce existing state
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
and federal laws will have a life-saving
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
impact our teams will work uh will do
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
work that uh will likely include Manning
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
static security points and roving
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
patrols to identify illegal immigrants
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
and drug trafficking activities which
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
will then be reported to the Texas
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
department of safety for the uh
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
Interventional activities placing
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
obstacles and designated locations along
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
the texo Texas Mexico border conducting
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
land clearing operations in prep
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
preparation for permanent fence
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
construction um these efforts will
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
assist Texas in securing the Border
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
making criminal arrests protecting
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
citizens and helping limit the dangerous
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
drugs from reaching New Hampshire my
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
request to you today aderes to state law
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
which allows for expenditures with your
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
consent in instances in which action is
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
called for on an expedited basis to
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
combat harms to the safety and the
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
welfare of the state I urge you to
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
ignore the politics surrounding this
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
crisis and focusing on simply addressing
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
the humanitarian crisis at hand stemming
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
the unchecked flow of drugs into our
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
country drugs that make their way to New
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and take the lives of Granite
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
State Staters is incumbent on us all I
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration of this
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
request to protect the well-being of
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
granite Staters um and happy to take any
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from committee
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
members representative Edwards and then
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
represent lean uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you governor for uh considering
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
my question um would would you would you
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
agree with me that the situation along
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
our Southern border may actually be
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
more dire than what you've described
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
here this morning I I I I put what's
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
happened to the millions of people
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
coming across the border in an
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
unaccountable way complete with uh
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
potential for Terror groups to set up
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
sabotage cells throughout the country I
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
I put this as uh on the same scale of
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
national security threat as Pearl Harbor
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
and 911 the difference is those were
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
kinetic events this is more subterfuge
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
to set up cells to undermine us this
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
will limit our ability in the future to
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
respond if Taiwan is attacked May limit
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
our ability to respond and support
 
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
Israel so so I think I think your
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
request is valid I believe I'm going to
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
support it but I don't know that uh
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're completely expressing the danger
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
that's been uh imposed on the nation by
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
failing to secure our border
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um you're
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely right to try to summarize the
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
tragedy that is happening there and a
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
few short minutes in a discussion here
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
is I think to your point is almost
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
impossible it is the number one national
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
security issue facing this country
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
unquestionably whether you're looking at
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh terrorism cells uh you know uh not to
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
move this to the northern border and
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
Southern border issue but the fact that
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have had hundreds and hundreds of of
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
apprehensions of individuals on the
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
terrorist watch list illegally trying to
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
illegally cross these borders um is it's
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
very real um so then you add the the
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
drugs and you had the trafficking when I
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
when you stand there and look across
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
that River you can literally see the
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
cartels like they're not off in the
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
distance they're like 100 ft away
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
looking right back at you and their blue
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
tent cities uh effectively holding
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
people hostage in those tent cities till
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
they can extort the funds out of them to
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
cross migrants are not allowed to cross
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
unless they pay off the cartels and
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
they're Crossing in thousands so now you
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
have the entire Southern border
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
effectively on the on the Mexico side at
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
least being controlled by multi-billion
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
Dollar Enterprises of some of the most
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
ruthless individuals on the planet
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
cartels that can be paid off for to do
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
anything so this is an immense uh issue
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
the the thing that stings me we talk a
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
lot about the fentanyl obviously and
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's really my number one uh Focus
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
here and I think the mission uh how it
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
affects new hampter family so darly but
 
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh again standing on that border um you
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
could write novels about what you see
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
with the the results of the human
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
trafficking the sexual trafficking the
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
trafficking of children um yeah I'll
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
tell you a little just one thing that
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
really got me you know if you're under
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
13 years old when you are first if you
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
are apprehended and you come across
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
illegally by border patrol you don't get
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
marked down you don't get recorded So
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
what happens they then traffic that
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
child and and if you have two in two
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
adults with you they are considered your
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
quote parents so they walk free so then
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
they take that child they being the
 
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
cartels traffic them back to the
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
southern border and use them effectively
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
as a mule to get freedom for two more
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
individuals and they do it again and
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
again and the board of Patrol has said
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
I've seen the same child a dozen times
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing I can do about it
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not allowed to enforce the laws I'm
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
not allowed to enforce the policies of
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
this country I've been told not to
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
border patrol Southern border patrol is
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
as frustrated as anyone and uh
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
especially again we're focusing on Eagle
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
Pass the main reason we're focusing on
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
Eagle passes I think as a lot of folks
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
know not just a couple hundred but
 
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of folks were coming across a
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
day the efforts that Governor Abbott put
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
into place really straining his own
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
resources have had Direct results they
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
reduce it from thousand a day to like 10
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
to 15 a day or even less I think in a
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
few days it's it's like under five so
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
you can this isn't just window dressing
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
these are getting real results and by
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
having New Hampshire and other states
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
step up they can now expand uh the
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
operations that have have yielded
 
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
results again not just for Texas but for
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
country second question follow
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
up uh thank thank you for your response
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
um so so this is a different type of
 
00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279 align:start position:0%
question I had a um an old broken down
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't mind me describing him that
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
way an old broken down retired sarden
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
major uh reach out to me who uh was uh
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
part of our efforts during the Vietnam
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
war to use National Guardsmen to provide
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
Riot security and uh so the question he
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
asked me was will our Guardsmen U be
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
protected from uh criminal immunity for
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
their official Act act what what was
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
required uh during the Vietnam war to
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
protect National Guardsmen because they
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
aren't protected like law enforcement
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
are from Criminal immunity from
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh is that they had to be uh
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
deputized locally so that they would get
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
that immunity shield and I know I'm
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
getting into some old history in detail
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm just concerned that given
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
that the migrants can initiate contact
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
with our soldiers even though that's not
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be part of their mission I I
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if they do
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
end up in some kind of um engagement
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's been incited by others that that
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
they are not subject to Federal Criminal
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
prosecution uh the answer to there is no
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh and and the reason is a couple F
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
number one they are going to be
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
following the letter of the law they
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
will not be breaking the law um as the
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
text military is doing as the Texas
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
department of safety is doing and they
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
the um Texas National Guard effectively
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
the Tex we've called the Texas
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
department of military I believe uh will
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
have operational control of these
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
individuals as they follow the law these
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
law I I I I may I may not have made my
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
concern clear I'm not worried about our
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
soldiers violating the law I'm worried
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
about wanting abuse of federal profit
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutory authority to if there is any
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
sort of contact to criminalize our
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen because of animosity to us
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
stepping up and doing the mission sure
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
so I I want to protect our soldiers from
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
Criminal prosecution to the extent that
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's a legal way to do it sure I look
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
I technically I would probably defer to
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney general for the for the
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
technical uh uh legalities there I would
 
00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
say this um we sent Guardsmen um men and
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
women of the National Guard to
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
California in 2021 we sent almost 200 of
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
them to mckel and Texas uh for almost a
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
Year's deployment just last year um th
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
those issues have never have never risen
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh which is again I believe the
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
protections are there thank
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
you represent Lehman for a question
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
followed by Senator gray thank you Mr
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thanks for being here
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
Governor so there have been I I believe
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
two requests in the past uh which were
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
funded by federal money this request of
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
course is general fund ons the $850,000
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
as someone that lost their son to
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
fentanyl fentanyl overdose I'm acutely
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on at the southern
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
border and with the drugs coming in from
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
as far away as India now China coming to
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
our West Coast some of the highest
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
amounts of fentanyl are pouring through
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
the border of California and Arizona
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
right now and a lot of that's being done
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
by American
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
citizens so my question to you you it
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that this $850,000
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriately spent with
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
drug and
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh prevention here in New
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or enforcement versus sending
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
15 Guardsmen down to Texas which to me
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
you know 15 Guardsmen I don't see them
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
doing you know not no disrespect to the
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
guard but 15 what kind of a difference
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
is that going to make on this thousands
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
of miles of Border where people are just
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
flowing across and being unchecked where
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
that 200 the $850,000 would be probably
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
better spent here in New Hampshire since
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
it is General funds and if your request
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
was or our request before us was federal
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
funds I don't think you'd have any
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
opposition but this general fund dollars
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
and as you indicated in your address uh
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday we've got to be pretty Frugal
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
and mindful of our spending so I just
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
hope you can respond to that sure um
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
look I we we spent a lot of money tens
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars on drug
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
introdiction here recovery treatment
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
programs uh we've put record numbers of
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
of dollars into those programs and by
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
all means if somebody wants to add some
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
more dollars into additional
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
interdiction efforts specifically around
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
our met teams and the department of
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
safety I'm all for that that would be
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
great but again um just because you're
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
focusing on efforts here uh the there is
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
a direct result of what's Happening Here
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
from the southern border there's no
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
question there is a complete lack of
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
effort on the department of the federal
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
government who has the roles and
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to enforce the laws on
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
the border to limit drug smuggling drug
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking but they're willingly not
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
doing it so the states are stepping up
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
so again you can't of course we have to
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
put all the efforts we can here at home
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
but if no one is going to mine that
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
southern border then the states are
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to step up and do it not one state
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
or two states but a partnership
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully of all 50 we'll see what
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
happens but uh in Partnership and to the
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
to the idea that well this is 15
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
individuals yeah look when I spoke with
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
Governor Abbott he'd love to see three
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
or four thousand people down on the
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
southern border well we have about one 1
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
250th of the US population so if every
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
state did stepped up and did what we're
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
doing yeah you'd end up with three or
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
4,000 people on the border we're doing
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
our part we're putting that that those
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
15 skilled individuals are exactly what
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're looking for exactly what they
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
need and the timeline that the folks on
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
the front line are looking for they're
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
looking for 60 to 90 days of assistance
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
so um no we're we're meeting the exact
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
needs as is being requested um and I I
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
think your point is very well taken we
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
can always have more efforts here on in
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we um we have opportunity
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
we have funds to do this um and again
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
the southern border is a huge part of
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
the problem here in New Hampshire
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
there's no question about
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for a question well it's as
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
much a statement as a question because
 
00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh as soon as I was informed of this
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
uh by the Senate President that this was
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to come before us the first words
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
out of my mouth to the Senate President
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
was the northern border okay and let me
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
explain why okay that we have
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
individuals in this state who have
 
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
fought against finding out if we have a
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
problem at the the northern border and
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
how big that problem is those same
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
individuals have said that's why we
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't spend any money on this that
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
or the other thing so the more I can get
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who understand the problem
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
and get training of what's
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
happening the better off New Hampshire
 
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
is we have States like New York and New
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
York City who now say they're full all
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
right that has gotten the atttention of
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
the president and Congress and now we
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
are going to in my opinion be more and
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
more Vigilant about people coming across
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
that southern border which is going to
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
put additional pressure on States like
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we have the northern
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
border and that is why I support this
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
those IND individuals who are would be
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
coming back after this deployment are
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
going to have information that I believe
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be very valuable to the
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
state as we secure the southern border
 
00:21:41.269 --> 00:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
and those individuals who are trying to
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
come across move to the northern border
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
and I'd let you comment if you'd care to
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
I no I I I agree wholeheartedly I mean
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
we've obviously and thanks to the
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislature and the efforts here uh
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
we've put a lot of effort on the
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
northern border you know the uh northern
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
border Alliance and that we've that
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
we've put together and again when we
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the northern border just to
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
be clear um you know we talking about
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
Maine uh New Hampshire Vermont into just
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
the eastern part we call the Swanton
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
sector the eastern part of New York um
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger issues we don't see
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
as much fentanyl we have see some coming
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
across the northern border to be sure um
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
the bigger issues on the northern border
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
for me revolve around the folks on the
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
terrorism watch list we have a lot of
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
folks on the terrorism watch list
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
specifically uh in the Buffalo and in
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
the swaton sector they come down uh out
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
of Montreal uh mostly uh but the the
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
issue at hand for for me and today and
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
for has been in the state for you know
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
over a decade now two decades almost uh
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
is the spanyol crisis and we know that
 
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
the vast majority almost all of it comes
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
up from that southern border and again
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's amazing that you know be you can
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
actually follow they can follow it so
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
closely it comes from the southern
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
border into Texas to New York and
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
Providence I'm not knocking on New York
 
00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:52.039 align:start position:0%
and Providence these are just kind of
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
the the way it comes up into Northern
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and then they use that as
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh as kind of a direct Highway into the
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
three Northern the New England State so
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
you can follow the bouncing ball it it's
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
not a hypothetical it's not supposition
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
you can see exactly what is coming from
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
the southern border and trace it right
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
up into um you know virtually every city
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
and town in in New Hampshire without a
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
doubt so um no it's very real it's
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
impactful and it's affecting families
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
today thank
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
you senator dallesandro for a question
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you thank you Mr shman Governor
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming it's always always
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
good to see you uh Governor uh as as you
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
know in hille 2 we we appropriated 1.5
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
billion for the northern border and uh
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
that's where we thought the concern was
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
for for New Hampshire and we we funded
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
that with general fund money so it it it
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
seems it seems to be we have done more
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
than our part in addressing this
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
situation the Congress of the United
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
States particularly the Republican
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
controlled House of Representatives has
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
refused to to accept a plan to deal with
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
the southern border situation and we've
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
got about 20,000 people at the southern
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
border right now between uh our border
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
patrol and and other entities it it it
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
seems to be that spending 800,000 of
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
general fund monies and sending 15
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
people although it's a wonderful thought
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
of of yours in terms of support it seems
 
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
to be the real issue is the Congress
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
funding what they should be funding to
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
protect the the the southern border our
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
15 guys AR going to make a great deal of
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
difference but
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
indeed your ability as a as
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
a high-ranking public official and a
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
member of the Republican party I think
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that effort should be spent getting the
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
republicans in Congress to come up with
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
the money that's that's that's there to
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
to to do what we should be doing and uh
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and certainly the fentanyl crisis is
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
problematic but as said by my colleague
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh representative leechman much of that
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
money much of that fentol is being
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
brought in by
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
Americans and it's a terrible terrible
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
situation and we deal with it here uh
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
our overdose debts in the city of
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester and the City of nashille have
 
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
been severe so it it it seems to be the
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
pressure should be should be uh really
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
really applied to the Republican members
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
of the Congress to fund border security
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh that's that to me is a great way to
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
spend our our money I could think of a
 
00:25:43.549 --> 00:25:43.559 align:start position:0%
couple of times government where with
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
the National Guard was brought brought
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
up and to to take care of things and one
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
was way way back uh just actually when
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
your father and I were colleagues in the
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
House of
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives when buddies had to be
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
spent by uh by that general fund money
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
because of the sebr situation because of
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
the the thousands of people that will
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
put in National Guard armories and so
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
forth and so on that was I think a
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
worthy use of of general fund Monies to
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
protect the people of the State of New
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and it it seems to me what
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
we' have done to the northern border boy
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
it it it makes a great deal of sense and
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're succeeding I I'm not sure that
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
800,000 when there are so many needs if
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
you looked at the number of of requests
 
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
for more money that are before the
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee as we speak
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
would' say uh how can we spend this
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
money better for the people of the State
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I and I appreciate
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
the sentiment but I I I think we have to
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
look at that would you address that sir
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely so let's first talk
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
about Washington DC the bill that is not
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
look like it's not going to pass in
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
Congress is a complete political red
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
herring the fact is that within the
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
first 100 days of office Joe Biden
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
signed 16 different executive orders
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
proclamations uh and policy memos that
 
00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559 align:start position:0%
rescinded uh the remain in Mexico policy
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
that reins stilled The Catch and Release
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
policy that completely handcuffed the
 
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
ability of border patrol to do their
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
jobs policy drastically changed that has
 
00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:21.799 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this bill the idea
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
that this bill is somehow a solution to
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
a problem that was created 3 years ago
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
on January 20th 2021
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
um is is um a fallacy and and it's all
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
that that's simply all politics you
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
bring up 20,000 people that are already
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
on the border down there that's right
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
and they're not allowed to do their jobs
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to patrol the way
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
they're they're designed to patrol the
 
00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
laws are very clear that say that um
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
that border patrol shall detain the laws
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
are very clear that says that a legal
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
entry is a federal crime the laws are
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
very clear that says that the uh border
 
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
patrol has a requirement to maintain
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
operation control through border
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
barriers and other means necessary so
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
all those laws are in place all those
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
policies were rescinded by Joe Biden
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the bill there's
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
funds there there's opportunity there
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's more of a policy crisis than
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
anything so by having what the the
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
governor of Texas has done is said okay
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
they he's actually removed border patrol
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
from that area said we're simply going
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
to not enforce random laws we're just
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
going to enforce the laws on our books
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
and on the federal books in conjunction
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
with what is already there um because
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
they won't now that requires funds state
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
of Texas has put up over $2 billion of
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
their own money $2 billion just to
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
Simply enforce laws that the federal
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
government uh has told their own team
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
not not to enforce um so that's I I just
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
caution folks to think that somehow if
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
this bill passed everything would
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
magically be fix of course that's not
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
true um they did not need this bill to
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
do their
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
jobs yeah thank you thank thank you
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
Governor I I just have one other comment
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
the governor of Texas put razor wires
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
razor wire out and put boys in the water
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
to uh deter people crossing the border
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh many people have have died there
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
there are few people that have drowned
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
because of this and that's that's kind
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
of inum made uh let's they got 20,000
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
people let them let them do their job
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
and and indeed it can be done if the
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
Republican L Congress of the United
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
States were to pass the legislation
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's before them that was passed in
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
the senate in a bipartisan vote uh we
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
we've got to do things in a bipartisan
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
manner in order to make things happen
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
you've articulated that on many
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
occasions and I and I think the response
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
would be very positive to to a
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan approach and I would hope
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
that you would you would use everything
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
in your power to make that happen so if
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
I may address that in 2022 there were
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
159 drownings along the Texas border uh
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
because folks were incentivized there
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
was no barrier they were incentivized to
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
try to risk their lives to come across
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
in the river since that razor wire has
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
been put up there's no longer an
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
incentive they know there's not a path
 
00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:09.799 align:start position:0%
for them to come that has been reduced
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
by a third there were only 55 drownings
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
ac across that Texas border in 2023 so
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
by having no barriers by having these
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
open incentives people are going to the
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
extremes risking their lives thinking
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
they're just crossing a river and they
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
end up drowning it's incredibly
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous it is not a razor wire issue
 
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
that is causing the drownings if
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
anything those barriers have reduced
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
67% Senator representative wner for a
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman Wier and um
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
Mr Governor this is the fiscal committee
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
and I do have your letter and your
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
request but usually we're these uh
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
requests that come before us are backed
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
up with details about how the money will
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
be spent and I wondered if you can
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
provide us with a detailed uh summary of
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
how these how this $850,000 will be
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
spent sure so this uh those funds uh
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
that estimate is being is provided by
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
obviously the the National Guard so I
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
defer if you I'll give as many details
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
as I can but I would also obviously
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
defer you to the um Adent General and
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
General hey Warren how are you um for
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
additional details but my uh that those
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
numbers were created and based on a
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
90-day deployment for 15 individuals
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
including the cost of housing um uh
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
daily wages um some minor equipment
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
costs travel uh things of that nature um
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah sure come on up or if there's other
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
other things in there and I would only
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
add that you know when we when I looked
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
at the estimated cost from the National
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
Guard and then compared to other costs
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
for other deployments uh everything
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
seemed to be at least in line with with
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
um you know what those expenses would
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
be for the record Warren Perry Deputy
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
agent General New Hampshire Department
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
of military Affairs and bment Services I
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I understood
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
the question uh representative you're
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
asking about how the how the $850,000
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh amount was arrived at yes so we a
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
detailed a a detailed summary of it that
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
we could have for the committee I I I
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
will I will get a no kidden detailed
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
summary I won't be able to speak
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily extemporaneously over it
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
people are we generally assess the cost
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
at about $600 a day per Soldier to go we
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
we estimated about
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
$650,000 just in salary and benefit so
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
that includes lodging meals uh pum uh
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
those those kinds of things that just
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
are General living expenses they don't
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
get the same pay that they would get if
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
they were federalized it's a little bit
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
less But it includes basic allowing for
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
housing basic allowance for subsistance
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
a pum for meals uh a $5 uh a day for
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
incidentals meal uh incidentals so about
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
$650,000 just in wages for 90 days and
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
then travel and other other Associated
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the equipment
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
moving things down but we'll get we can
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
get a detailed accounting of that of
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
that amount I think we would appreciate
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
you representative Rosen mul for a
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
question Senator thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
and thank you governor for being with us
 
00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:24.519 align:start position:0%
this morning I think we should note that
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
the Border
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.590 align:start position:0%
the Border
Patrol

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
Patrol
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
Endor the bipartisan Senate deal that
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
the US House torpedoed but what I wanted
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
to say is that in Senate Finance we're
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
all really careful with money and we're
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
sitting on some
 
00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:50.360 align:start position:0%
important appropriation bills because
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
one we're
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
uncertain in the middle of the budget
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
how revenues are going to hold up and
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
two we think we're facing potentially
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
some big expenditures that might come at
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
us these bills
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
include money to fight
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria from president Bradley
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
which is not only threatening the health
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
of our Lakes but leading to an alarming
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
rise in ALS cases and another bill that
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
would appropriate money to remediate
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
lead paint dust which is poisoning
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
hundreds of New Hampshire children every
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
year and I wonder if you would agree
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
with me that bills like these these two
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
efforts would have a more direct and
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the health and
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
well-being of granite Staters than
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
sending this this National Guard unit
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
down to Texas thank you I got to tell
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
you I love seeing being the Democrats so
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
fiscally disciplined it's wonderful I
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
love I love the sentiment
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
um the the two comments I'll I'll put
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
their cater and and I appreciate the
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
comments very much um look we've created
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of opportunity in the state
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
economically we have great surpluses we
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
have a lot of financial opportunity and
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
I would challenge that there is no
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
bigger Health crisis in the state right
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
now than losing four to 500 people a
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
year every year for the past 10 years um
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't just it's not just I mean
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
those loss of lives are devastating it
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
devastates families it Bank it bankrupts
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
families with what you're you add into
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
the individuals that aren't maybe not
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
haven't died from it but have been
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
addicted for years um have had all the
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh subsequent illnesses that come from
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
that so if you ask me the fentanyl
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
crisis is the number one crisis uh that
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state has faced in terms of health
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh in in quite a long time we've put a
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
lot of money and a lot of effort to it
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
um this is less than a million dollars
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
to do something that should have been
 
00:35:59.950 --> 00:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
done by somebody else but they're
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do it Joe Biden is
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do it and not only is he
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
unwilling to do it he's actually
 
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
proactively told his teams to not follow
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
law to not do what they're supposed to
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
do um so again I I think this is a a
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
terrific expenditure of $850,000 to be
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
part of a national effort to finally
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
stop uh and and have a a stronger effort
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
to slow down the fentanyl that is
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
completely unmitigated in terms of
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
coming into this country for that 450
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
million doses that was um of fentanyl
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
that was obtained by Texas um imagine
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of millions of doses of
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
fentanyl came in that they didn't get
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
right that's just what they got um and
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
given that you have we've seen it all on
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
TV folks coming in by the thousands a
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
day thousands and thousands and
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
thousands in each of these entryways a
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
day and when you know that the smuggling
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
and the and that what the cartels are
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
doing this is a multi-billion dollar
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
operation uh on the other side of the
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
border to drive this um and look I and I
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
have to go back a little bit while I
 
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
respect some of the comments that were
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
made here that there are Americans
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
involved in drug trafficking make no
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
mistake this is driven by Mexican drug
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
cartels the most Ruth ruthless
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
individuals on the planet um these are
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
murderers these are sex traffickers
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
these are human traffickers these are
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
drug dealers that are praying on the
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity that Joe Biden has handed
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
them with an open border so if we can be
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
part of that 50-state effort I
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely think this $850,000 out of
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
our what's our budget per year Mr chair
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
7 billion plus 7 A5 billion a year that
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
we spend I think we can we can find the
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
850,000 in all the surpluses that we
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
keep bringing in month after month to
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
make a uh to be part of this National
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
effort to finally uh put some assistance
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
and help if we just sit back and say you
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
know what Texas thanks good job keep
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
going keep spending your own dollars on
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
the behalf of the other 49 states that
 
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
is not the solution this is a national
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
crisis and and uh it's a 50 at this
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
point it's not a federal crisis a
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
federal issue because they're not taking
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
it up so the states are going to do what
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
what we do best we're going to stand up
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
and protect our citizens so M Mr chair I
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
urge committee members to stay on the
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
subject of the discussion today are you
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
ready for a
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
motion I I have others still to to
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
discuss I'll come back to you uh Senator

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
statute sorry correct if 400 deaths from

fentanyl per year since 2015 is not a
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
civil emergency I don't know what
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
is how quickly we forget that 11
 
00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.190 align:start position:0%
is how quickly we forget that 11
terrorists

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
terrorists
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
736 known or suspected terrorists have
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
been apprehended at the border and that
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't count the Goda ways we watch the
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
news every
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%

it hotels
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
them Street crime in many cities from
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
illegal migrants is out of control we
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
have seen that and then we have
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
seen the reaction when they get bail and
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
their use of gestures of what they think
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
system if this isn't a civil emergency
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
nothing is a civil e emergency now would
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
you agree with me because there's been a
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion already this morning
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
about the inability of Congress to act
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
the house has actually passed hr2 which
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
is a real border security measure which
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
contrast to the quote unquote bipartisan
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
measure which allowed 500 thou 5,000
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
people per day 1.8 million people to
 
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
cross the border every day before
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
there'd be any
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
amount of enforcement did not
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
reinstitute the remain and Mexico policy
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
did not end Catch and Release
 
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
liberalized work permits and provided
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
new resources to people to um be able to
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
use the legal system in this country
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
that may have been bipartisan but it
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
security so I don't think you are left
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
with any choice whatsoever than to
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
work with people like Governor Abbott in
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%

veterans home that
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
what you have an overall Staffing
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate of 35% and a nursing
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
44% um my question is what specific
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
efforts are you undertaking to fill
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
those jobs particularly the nursing 61
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so we have
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
been um recruiting heavily with uh any
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
means possible so we go to colleges
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be at one of the college
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
campuses uh that specializes in nursing
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
education so we're doing job fairs at
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
colleges we're in the newspapers we're
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing as many press release articles as
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
we can uh this week we were on the front
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
of two papers which was wonderful uh
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
highlighting our LNA program our
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistant program which
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
we created and have had some great
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
success with creating nursing position
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh and to nursing positions through the
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing program and we continue
 
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.270 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing program and we continue
to

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
um we are supported by the governor in
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
the 10% raise that helped us because
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
those nursing fees or their nursing um
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
salaries were and um helped with
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
enhancements and the enhancements were
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh tough to always um recruit nurses in
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
because they knew we had to go every two
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
years so those enhancements when they
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
became part of their regular salary has
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
helped us and we are seeing a decline we
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
were up in the 48% for nurses and so
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's starting to go down which has
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
been helpful for us so we're going to
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
continue on the same path and try to
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
recruit we're trying to uh let people
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
know that when they're graduating from
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
nursing school you don't have to go to
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
the ERS you don't have to go into the
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
med surge you can come to long-term care
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
um and so we're going to continue that
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
that those
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
efforts thank you thank you thank you so
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
you have a 44% nursing vacancy rate but
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have a
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
44% bed
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
census um are patients getting less
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
Direct
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
Care from nursing staff because of your
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
high vacancy rates no we actually are
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
holding a 44% vacancy rate for the
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
resident beds as well as well so we we
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
are only holding right now 127 residents
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
I have five more pending uh five more
 
00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
veterans will be coming in the next
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks we have capped our
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
census at 137 because we need to provide
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
the quality of care that they uh deserve
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
and they expect um and we want to make
 
00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
sure our nursing Staff feel comfortable
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
with the care they're providing so we
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
have not filled all of our beds and all
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
of our vacancies with the vet because we
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
can't do that until we have a a larger
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%

representative Earth is recognized thank
 
00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions and I
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
apologize if they're somewhat repetitive
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
because I did try to ask these questions
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
um this note makes reference
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
to mobile integrated healthc care and at
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
first that made me think of our mobile
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
crisis units that DHHS uh supports and I
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand this is not that I'm assuming
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
it means ambulances since we're talking
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
about the EMS here um and it also talks
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
about initiatives development
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
implemented by local Fire EMS a local
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS agencies assisting patients in
 
00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
taking care of themselves in their own
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
homes I'm just wondering if you could
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
tell me a little bit more about what
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is outside of
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
what the normal EMT function is um in a
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
community uh yes uh thank you for the
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
question um so mobile Integrated Health
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
has been in New Hampshire for uh a
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
little while um we used this initial
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
Grant um to fund uh my full-time
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
position and some other trainings to
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
train the local uh fire and EMS agencies
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
that that provide EMS so it's a function
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
of EMS but it's on more of the
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
prevention side it's proactively going
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
out to their communities depending on
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
what programs they want to develop in
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
regards to um whe whether it's a Falls
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
program or it it's an education program
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
so it's proactive rather than being
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
called to an emergency incident it's the
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
firing EMS people that provide uh em uh
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
EMS Services they're going out to their
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
Community speaking with individuals um
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
it could be they just got discharged by
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
the hospital so they're going to do a
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
house call to explain what their
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
medications are to make sure they're
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
doing medications while they're doing it
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
that they may do it like a home survey
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
um to remove any trip hazards um so
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
there's multiple different um programs
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
that communities can come out with um
 
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
what we've tried to do at the state is
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
build that framework and provide this
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
training um to the locals so they can
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
build these programs within their
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
communities um and the goal of these
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
programs is to reduce these individuals
 
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
either having to call an an ambulance in
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
the middle of the night to go to the
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
emergency room because they didn't do
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
their prescriptions correctly um so it's
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
really a proactive report uh a proactive
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
approach um to provide Health Care um
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
and provide a mechanism with the trained
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
Personnel um to to deal with these
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
individuals that may not fully
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
understand what medications they need or
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
or something to that
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
effect follow up thank you that that
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
helps quite a bit so I'm from where
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
small town would I expect to see this in
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
my community or is this more targeted
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
like Manchester nashille the the cities
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's for any Community um it's a it's
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
resources they need the resources um I
 
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:43.640 align:start position:0%
mean we have larger communities that
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
have it we have smaller communities to
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
have it and it really depends on what
 
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
the community chooses to do um it could
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
be a uh it could be like just going into
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's house and helping them do a
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
televisit with their primary care or
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
checking so it's really up to the local
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
um what we do at the state is there's
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
requirements and protocols that they
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
have to follow to make sure that
 
00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
everything's being done part of this
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
funding is actually to to supply um
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
software to the locals at no cost to
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
them to be able to because they have to
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
provide patient care documentation that
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
this is what they did um so it really
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
it's up to the community specific
 
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement um but it does
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
fall within the em
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
explanation representative Edwards for a
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I I I
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
really don't have a well-formed question
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
about this I just uh have a discomfort
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's come up as I've I've listened to
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
this this is a the the government doing
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
proactive Health and Welfare checks on
 
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:50.990 align:start position:0%
proactive Health and Welfare checks on
our

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
citizens and uh so this brings up issues
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
of of of um of of of consent and of
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
appropriateness and reimbursement and
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
all and all of that and I I just would
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
like to know uh what kind of review
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
process has there been to to really take
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
a look at uh how we're identifying
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
potential I'm going to call them
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
patients clients whatever the right term
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
is how how we how we're making sure that
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
we're really getting the right people
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that we're not overreaching
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
um or under reaching how how is there is
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
there a review process to make sure we
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
got this just
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
right um I'm
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
sorry um so there's a review process in
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
the program uh to make sure it meets all
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
the requirements as part of the review
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
process um the EMS agency uh contacts
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
the like the home healthcare area um
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
because it's somewhat overlaps with that
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
um as I said it was proactive it's not
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily proactive where EMS agencies
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
are going to like cold calling knocking
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
people it's really a referral process um
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
from their PCP um so if they uh if they
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
really their Community is the one that
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
is kind of advertising that they have
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
this service um but there no one's
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
required to do it um they're not um
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're not like like I said coold
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
calling people knocking on people's
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
doors um it's really it could be is we
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
go to an EMS incident and it's the third
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
time that we've gone to this individual
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
this week we provide them with
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
information about the program um but
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's really it's it's up to the
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
patient um to whether they want the
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
services or not
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh representative F moves
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%

24061 Senator dandro second is there any
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%

00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
all in favor say I I oppose no the item
 
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
moving on to tab six and
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%

you uh thank you Mr attorney general
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
take my question um so this one kind of
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
ties into the ones I've been asking one
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
pre previously asked this talks about
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
coordinating Statewide crisis inter
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
intervention and Behavioral Health
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
initiatives and as I'm sure you're well
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
aware the DH HHS has this mobile baby
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
Health crisis intervention thing and I
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
understand that these are not related um
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
and it talks about establishing a
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide treatment coordinator and
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
they'll help standardize treatment
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
courts could you just explain what what
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
these are and and how may may or may not
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
interact with other things we have in
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
the state related to uh Behavioral
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
Health crisis absolutely thank you for
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
the question representative so this this
 
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
is a Federal grant that is really
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
focused on on Behavioral Health but but
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health in the criminal
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
justice system and in law enforcement so
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
this uh this is a skip Grant so the
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
state Crisis Intervention uh program and
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's an interesting Grant it's a
 
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
good opportunity for the state it it
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
will provide the state on an ongoing
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
basis a little over $650,000 a year um
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
to do these types of things but this
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
particular Grant required a lot of
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
vetting under this grant we had to set
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
up a crisis intervention Advisory board
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
with stakeholders that board had to
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
include law enforcement uh community
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
members representatives from the courts
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and Behavioral Health
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
Providers victim Services professionals
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
and and legal counsel so we set up a
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
board that represented all these
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders we had a couple of County
 
00:58:05.789 --> 00:58:05.799 align:start position:0%
attorneys on the board we had Susan
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
Sterns the head of Nami on the board we
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
had Maggie Pritchard who's the executive
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
director of The Lakes Region Mental
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
Health Center on the board um Diane
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
Martin administr uh director of the
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts so
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
we we had a wide range of stakeholders
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
on this Advisory Board and we had we
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
vetted ideas for spending this money
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
through that board we had to do that and
 
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
then submit a request to the federal
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
government before we could even draw
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
down these funds before we could even
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal for approval to draw down
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
these funds so I just think that's
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's important background but there's
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
a couple of things we're proposing to do
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
with this money the first as as you
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
noted is to establish a a uh Behavior
 
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:51.039 align:start position:0%
Health initiatives um a crisis
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
intervention and behavior health
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
initiatives coordinator position within
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good work going on in
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement right now with regard to
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
Crisis Intervention training and and um
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
other work to look at how law
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement can respond to the Mental
 
00:59:08.029 --> 00:59:08.039 align:start position:0%
Health crisis in the state historically
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Justice we have
 
00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:12.039 align:start position:0%
never had any capacity for that we
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
currently don't have any any single
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
person at the Department of Justice the
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
chief law enforcement agency of the
 
00:59:20.109 --> 00:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
state with mental health background or
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
or who's dedicated to doing doing work
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
to to think about how law enforc can
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
respond to the Mental Health crisis so
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
the vision for this position is to help
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
us think about how uh or develop
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
strategies and and develop initiatives
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Justice to assist
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Statewide with
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
responding to the Mental Health crisis
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh this position
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
will lias with law enforcement agencies
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
across the state uh both state local and
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
County to figure out what they're doing
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to training try to gather
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
some data on who's doing what to try to
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
get everybody Co coordinated and on the
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
same page as to what the best strategies
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
are it will help us get a sense of who
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
who's doing well with training who is
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
who is able to provide their officers
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
with training who isn't will help us
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
look at what resources the state is
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
putting towards this and and where the
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
gaps are I think it'll be really helpful
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
it'll just it it will it is I see it as
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
the beginning of building some capacity
 
01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Justice to
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
think about how law enforcement can
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
respond to the mental Mental Health
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
crisis the second position a state
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
treatment courts coordinator
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch right now you know
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
for years has has been piloting a drug
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
court which has been very successful in
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of counties they're looking to
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
further develop mental health courts and
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
they I think they have the same need
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
they have a need for for someone who can
 
01:00:44.549 --> 01:00:44.559 align:start position:0%
help coordinate all of those efforts I
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
think this is a really good use of funds
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
and these are really good positions to
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
have because they help us think from the
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
ground up how we're going to build out
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
these capacities sometimes I you know
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes in government you see grant
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
money come in and you think oh we just
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
want to spend a lot of money on on XYZ
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
but we don't have somebody really
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about how we're going to build
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
out that strategy so I think starting
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
with these types of positions in the
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and the Department of
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
Justice to help us build out a strategy
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
is a good initial use of these funds so
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
sorry that was a long answer but there's
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of background to this grant that I
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
thought I should give you thank you very
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
much I appreciate all the background and
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%

thanks further questions from committee
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
members move the item a motion by
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ur second by Senator
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
Bradley to move the item I have one more
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
question when I read uh Statewide
 
01:01:35.319 --> 01:01:36.549 align:start position:0%
question when I read uh Statewide
treatment

01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
Court what is included other than mental
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
health court and Drug Court does it also
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
include veterans court what courts are
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
included in treatment courts so Diane
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
Martin the director of the
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
administrative office of the courts is
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
here so I don't I'll let her speak to
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
that if she thinks i' leave any holes in
 
01:01:57.230 --> 01:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
my answer but yes it does include drug
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
court um mental health courts there
 
01:02:03.789 --> 01:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this concept of of uh uh
 
01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
with with some counties at least County
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
attorney offices about whether the court
 
01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
should should um develop some
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
Specialties and and uh and um perhaps a
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
special court for for youth who are
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
Justice involved there certainly
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
veterans courts are something that that
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
exists and that I think the courts
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
longterm would would perh s like to
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
build out so it includes I think it
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
includes all of that because all you
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
know those are all different categories
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
of individuals who may need special
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
treatment within the court system thank
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
you I don't need to wait for some other
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
one to answer it I have a motion in a
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
second is there any further discussion
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
Jasper good morning Mr chairman members

of the
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee and with me I have Joshua

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.269 align:start position:0%
Agriculture Agricultural Development
excuse

01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
me was this uh represent representative
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
rosenal for a question thank you and
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal it's not really about
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture but this
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
first item of arpa fund accept and
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
expend we've
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
been trying to get information for over
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
over a year now
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
on what amounts of ARA funds have been
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated but won't be spent and
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
therefore are
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
available for reallocation and you just
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
happen to come up first but we did get
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
this wonderful chart in twoo font
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday I think from be from
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
gopher that
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
indicates that they there's 30 I think
 
01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.269 align:start position:0%
indicates that they there's 30 I think
38.7

01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
38.7
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
million that can be moved around and
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
today we're being asked to spend 32
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
million of that leaving I think
 
01:04:43.599 --> 01:04:45.190 align:start position:0%
million of that leaving I think
5.7

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
5.7
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
million that is still available but I
 
01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
why is this not a request from goer but
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
a request from
 
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
agriculture are you getting this money
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
directly from the federal government or
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
is it still coming from gopher it my
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is still coming from
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
gopher as you may know there was a um a
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that would have appropriated
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
this amount but we've been in
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
discussions all along I have been you
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
know bugging if you will uh commissioner
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
Caswell for a very long time about if
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
there was a reallocation would there be
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
availability for for agriculture
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's come to fruition my
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is currently the bill with
 
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
the 8 million of General funds has been
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
put on hold um and so we were told that
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
yes this would be an agricultural
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
agriculture request from from from
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
gopher but this was a a collaboration if
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
you will all the way through the process
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner with the
 
01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.549 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner with the
governor's

01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:02.559 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
office could I ask a question commiss
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
Caswell uh d uh director Caswell since
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
there going to be many items here if you
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
want you can take one of the seats at
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
the end of the table over there and use
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
that microphone because you'll probably
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
have to chime in on many of these other
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
items thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
good morning commissioner my
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we have until this
 
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
fall to do any
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
reallocations and this this chart is
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
fantastic how often will we be getting
 
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
updates so that if the
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to whisper into the
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
ears of the executive branch we'd have
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
and the knowledge of what might be
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
available yes thanks Senator and again
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
Taylor Caswell uh here as the executive
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
director of gopher um this document I
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
apologize for the font size we'll we'll
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll update that in future
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
versions in the email we can yes ma'am
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
um so this uh group of reallocations all
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
emanate from programs that were approved
 
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
for gopher to administer so the lists
 
01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
that you have here are not from other
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
agencies at this point they are all
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
exclusively programs that were under the
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
control of gopher to administer his
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
programs so we were able to be the first
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
to go through our own programs and make
 
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
the determination as to which of those
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
funds uh are no longer going to be used
 
01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
or they've been closed out and they've
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
been otherwise written down so at this
 
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
point that we had roughly as you say
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
about 34 $35 million worth of funds in
 
01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:57.799 align:start position:0%
that program we also have a long list of
 
01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
requests from agencies um uh
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper being included there
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
for programs such as this or for
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
programs that are um running over in
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
cost so several of these as you know
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
were approved um now probably two years
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
ago and some of those are capital costs
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
that have seen increases in cost so
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to address those as
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
the priority um and so as we move
 
01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.390 align:start position:0%
the priority um and so as we move
forward

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
um it is difficult for me to say right
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
now spec and I know you've heard me say
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
this before but specifically how much
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
money is going to come back because it
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
really depends on the ability for
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
agencies to spend um at a burn rate that
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
gets them uh within the obligation
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
deadline of the end of this calendar
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
year um I would add as we spoke about
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
earlier this week too is um in almost
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
all cases uh funds that have been um
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
approved by fiscal committee have
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
spending Authority only out till June
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
30th of this calendar year so that gives
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
us an opportunity at that point to
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
really see exactly which of these
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
programs are going to have funds that
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to get re obligated
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
prior to the federal deadline of the end
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
year further question well that timing
 
01:09:16.199 --> 01:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
year further question well that timing
is

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because our legislative work
 
01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
is going to be done by
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
June of this fiscal year so are you
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
going to be updating this chart every
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
month I believe that there are some
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
additional um um requests that will come
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
for the March fiscal and if those
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
involve funding pools that are outside
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
of this then absolutely those will be
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
provided uh much earlier I would say
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
than we were able to give it to you
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
earlier this week for the next round of
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
funds but it will not be a I do not
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
expect it to be anywhere near the total
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
of this amount one vyl if I one final
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
so when you come before us with these
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
requests we're given the chance to say
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
yes or no there's no opportunity because
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
we can't add items to the fiscal agenda
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
to say here's what the legislature not
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
just the 10 of us
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
but the entire legislature thinks might
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
be appropriate uses of those funds and
 
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
so it's a source of frustration for some
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
of us who think that the spending
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
decision should be made by more than
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
just 10 people and that's why we keep
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
asking for this great information and
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
hope it will come before the next fisal
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
meeting absolutely ma'am yes we will we
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
will absolutely um um U be providing
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
that information as we go ahead thank
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman sen lean for a
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:10.830 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
representative

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
Le I I'll take the senator at least for
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
the question but anyway thank you Mr
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and nice to see you
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I see uh there's a like
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
a $15 million total loss and you're only
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at getting 8 million
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious are you going to put in
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
request for the other seven from General
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
funds or federal funds or no sir thank
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question so our
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
intent was never to make everybody whole
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
the intent was to keep people from going
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
out of business now that $15 million
 
01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
loss is an estimate because that was
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
based on a
 
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
survey and so we don't really know what
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
will we'll have for total reported
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
losses we expect that it will be higher
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
than that but because of some of the
 
01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
eligibility th the numbers are going to
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
change so I can tell you what our our
 
01:12:07.229 --> 01:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
plan is now because the important thing
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
is to get money out to those who had
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
extreme losses to allow them to be able
 
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
to to buy seed and fertilizer Etc and
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
because everybody's a little different
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
on when they have their profit and loss
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
statements their schedule FS Federal
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
income tax right now we're on schedule
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
to to open this up in April 1st and
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
every week we will be evaluating what
 
01:12:36.189 --> 01:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
comes in so our intent at the current
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
plan is so if somebody comes in and
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
they're requesting
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
$100,000 we will award them immediately
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
$50,000 we'll keep this open probably
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
till about June
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
1st and at that time we will close out
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
the program we will true up the numbers
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
so this allows at giving out 50 m uh 50%
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
request um which is we're really only
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
looking to do 50% to begin with that
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
allows us for a total Statewide loss of
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
32 million which we do not believe will
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
happen but that way we would not over
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
reward anyone and we'd be we expect
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
everyone would get additional funds
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
there but in in the farming business the
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
importance is really going to be getting
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
that money out in the spring so we're
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to be ready to go when we get
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
through Governor Council assuming that
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
this is approved uh today meeting with
 
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee before the end of
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
the month to run this by them we're
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
working with other stakeholders to make
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not missing anything in
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
the application process and we're
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
working very closely with u UNH
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension with their their
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
experts in economics and in farming to
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're getting all of this
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
stuff right and we want to get this
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
money out the door as soon as possible
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%

24039 thank you thank you Mr ch but
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
apologize so was
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
inconvenienced uh thank you commissioner
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
when I looked at the the spend of the
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
money that we had already given only
 
01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
half of the money has been
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
spent could you give me a clue as to why
 
01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
we're giv a more money when they haven't
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
spent the money we gave them yeah so the
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
initial project was scheduled it's a
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
construction project which obviously uh
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
takes some amount of time the project is
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled to last through June of 2025
 
01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
um they're actually spending a ahead of
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
probably the anticipated rate in terms
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
of how they would um progress and
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
they're making substantive progress on
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the progress or the the buildout
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
um I have visited there twice and walked
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
through the program to make sure that
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
they're making the progress so I think
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
they're actually in good shape okay but
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
they do have three billion of the six
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
billion left they do but it I mean and
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually about a $15 million total
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
project that they're working on so
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
there's quite a lot of work to be done
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
there further question further question
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
what is going on at the facility as we
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
speak the old crunch Bel facility what
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
what is left of the operational the
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
operational situation that existed prior
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
to the closure and so for yeah so they
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
are bringing back a substantive amount
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
of the programming that they had um the
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
work that we are focused on is really
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
the work for New Hampshire students in
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
particular um our residential students
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
particularly focused on the autism
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
population um in terms of the uh the the
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
work that they have been doing they
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
prioritize the residential uh facilities
 
01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
that they have for these students and
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's been kind of the main emphasis of
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
the work that has been going on um those
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
residential facilities should be open
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
fairly soon um today I think they have
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
39 students that are there 23 are
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
residential students and they'll be
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
opening that up I believe they're going
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to get as many as 60 students
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
on campus for residential placement and
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
up to close to a 100 of day students as
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
well when they get all of the
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
refurbishment done okay one further
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
question when when will they be able to
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
uh take care of these hundred students
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about when will this
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
refurbishment Etc be done and will they
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
need more money uh so there's no
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that they would be
 
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
receiving more money or that they would
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
need more money that they are funding
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
the other aspects of this project and
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
again the completion date is 2025 June
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
2025 thank you thank you Mr CH thank you

seconds to adopt item
 
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
2439 any further discussion seeing n
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
you're ready for the question all in
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
favor say I I oppose no the item is
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
adopted moving on next to item
 
01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:50.070 align:start position:0%
adopted moving on next to item
2404

01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
Z Senator rosenal is recognized question
 
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I didn't really have a
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
question so much as a comment that I
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of nonprofits that
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
have lost money and I
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
didn't come to learn anything that would
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
indicate to me that this particular
 
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
indicate to me that this particular
one

01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
deserves um reimbursement so I just
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to vote on it thank you don't
 
01:19:23.669 --> 01:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
want to have any questions no thank you
 
01:19:25.629 --> 01:19:25.639 align:start position:0%
any me member of the committee have any
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
question I don't have a question but if
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
I could speak to it Senator so I think
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
if you look back at
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
um many of the items that we have funded
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
over the course of this process an awful
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
lot of nonprofits have been
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
funded the Highland Games um in
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
Lincoln had to abide by the new protocol
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of tent policy based on what
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
happened in Lancaster where people were
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
killed and they used all du
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
caution um to cancel part of the 2023
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
games um it was actually a wise decision
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
as the winds were um what was expected
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
the tents lifted up there were no people
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
there so there was no one hurt but when
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
the tents collapsed uh the poles were
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
bent and it would have been a problem
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
had people been there so my
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is the games bring in
 
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
35,000 plus people um every Hotel up and
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
down Route 93 in the Plymouth to
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
Littleton area is fully booked that's a
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
huge amount of Revenue that comes into
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
the state it's a Economic Development
 
01:20:48.629 --> 01:20:48.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue I'm not going to say it's like
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
motorcycle week but it certainly um sign
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
$450,000 um so this doesn't make them
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
whole but it certainly um similar to the
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
debate that we just had on agriculture
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
um should enable them to continue to do
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
what they do and the state of New
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire benefits from rooms and meals
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
tax um to say nothing of the ancillary
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
spending that comes in so I think that
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
we have many examples of not for-profits
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
having been funded through the arpa
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
processes would be one more based on
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.830 align:start position:0%
okay representa Le has a question on
item

01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
24041 thank you thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
nice to see you of course commissioner
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
so the item says that uh General funds
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
may be needed if federal funds are no
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
longer available could you give us an
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
idea what may means is that like 500,000
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
a million or maybe nothing at all um I'm
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
going to um answer that at this point
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
this is a study of a of uh security
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
measures at all the uh court system
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
around the state and I believe what the
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
lon is referring to is that the results
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
of that study may require funds outside
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the federal uh funds to com to to to
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
fulfill the the outcome of the that
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
security study okay thanks thank you Mr
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%

2441 second by Senator Bradley are there
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%

you're ready for the question all in
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
favor say I I oppos no items adopted
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
2470 still within Tab 8 it's the last
 
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
quite representative leean question on
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.270 align:start position:0%
quite representative leean question on
2470

01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
chairman to see you Charlie good to be
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
here so um a similar question that the
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
item also says that the federal funds
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
may not be available that General funds
 
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
may be requested to support the program
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
I just curious if you had a better
 
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
number than you know six I think this
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
calls about $6 million of federal funds
 
01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.110 align:start position:0%
calls about $6 million of federal funds
and

01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's uh oh for the record I'm
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
Charlie Arling house I work at
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
um I think it's going to be enough money
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
and I think the it's a construction
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
project and I and we're working with the
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
legislature on it and and I suspect that
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it's the kind of thing where you know
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
if you're working with Terry on
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
something he doesn't want to Forstall
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to ask for more money
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
later so just to follow up so you you
 
01:24:53.550 --> 01:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
don't plan each your hat then if this
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
goes over I do not okay good thanks
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%

million of fund to set aside as a
 
01:26:42.910 --> 01:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
reserve um to deal with a situation
 
01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
where Federal Medicaid funds may not be
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
claimable uh for facilities that are
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
considered to be qrtp qual qualified

Residential Treatment um
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
um programs sorry I'm forgetting the
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
acronym there um it's come to our
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
attention that those could potentially
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
be considered imds if they are
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
considered imds then the federal funds
 
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be claimable um we are actively
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
investigating uh this situation we're
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
looking at every facility to understand
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether they are considered qrps we're
 
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
also uh reaching out to our partners in
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
other states because we are not the only
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
state in the country that is currently
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue um we've also
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
been on uh the phone with members of the
 
01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
delegation to DC as there is discussion
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
at the federal level to potentially
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
resolve uh this issue so it's a very to
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
Senator Dell Sandra's point it's a very
 
01:27:37.709 --> 01:27:37.719 align:start position:0%
Dynamic situation um this is a reserve
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
that we're setting aside we will likely
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
come back in May and go ahead and move
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
those funds back if if we can um but we
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
really just want to make sure that we
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
had the funds
 
01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
available one further question the the
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
material that you you gave us
 
01:27:56.590 --> 01:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
I can't read it the point is so small
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
that even with the magnifying glass I
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
can't figure it out so I would I would
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
say that U if if indeed you need more
 
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:06.760 align:start position:0%

01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
explanation that the long acting
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
injectable antis psychotic has doubled
 
01:33:45.510 --> 01:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
in price from one year to the
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
next and um my question is have you
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
gotten any EX explanation from the
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of how they justify
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
doubling the price in one year uh at
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
this time no we we haven't gotten any
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
justification from the manufacturer on
 
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.709 align:start position:0%
justification from the manufacturer on
that

01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
use get a little closer apologies uh at
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
this point in time no we have not uh
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
gotten any justification from the
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturer on the pricing of the
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
product followup is this the 340b price
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh on that particular medication that
 
01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
would not be the 340b price we have a
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
340b STD Grant which allows us to order
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
our uh hcv HIV uh and other STD related
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
medications through that Grant we are
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
looking at expanding that uh at this
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
point in time but at this point in time
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
we just order for the uh STD grant for
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
STD based uh
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
prescribing follow up please th this is
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
new news to me I thought we were fully
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
using the
 
01:34:58.590 --> 01:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
340b program in the Corrections
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
Department thank you senator for your
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
comments um I will respond to that for
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
you we have been um researching that the
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
possibility of using the three Federal
 
01:35:13.109 --> 01:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
340b program for all medications at this
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
time there are only two other uh excuse
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
me pardon me now three other states
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
doing that and we were watching and
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring that process process and
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
learning from them in fact Dr carbon has
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
had contact with North Dakota I believe
 
01:35:30.189 --> 01:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
it is in another state to talk with them
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
about the specifics of the arrangements
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
of doing that we are looking forward to
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
doing that as soon as we can it is on my
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
agenda when I meet with commissioner
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hanks next week to so we can start
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
taking steps know if we can be will make
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
sure um she is aware of that we will
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
communicate to you Senator thank you
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Senator
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
dallesandro thank you Mr chairman we've
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
been concerned about the drug costs in
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
the in Corrections for a long period of
 
01:36:01.229 --> 01:36:01.239 align:start position:0%
time it and I I think a number of
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions have been made about doing
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
things uh to reduce these cost you you
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
know creative ways doing
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
that and and the number the number of
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
people who are receiving medications at
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
the correction facilities uh seems to be
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh the severity of of the problem the
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
medical problem and the the amount of
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
money that we're spending are we still
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
diligently working for solutions to
 
01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.950 align:start position:0%
diligently working for solutions to
cross

01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
control the short answer Senator and
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question is yes we are
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
exploring and continue to explore all
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of creative ways to manage costs
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
for example we are fortunate to be part
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
of the uh State opioid response grant
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
money to cover costs for medications for
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
treatment of opioid use disorder that is
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
a significant cost savings to the state
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
we have a what's called in very typical
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
in healthcare environments Pharmacy and
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics committee also known as a
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
p&amp;t committee where we meet with the
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
heads for the example the chief medical
 
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:11.239 align:start position:0%
officer Chief Dental officer Chief
 
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatric officer and look at
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
utilization um of certain medications
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
additionally in addition to I'm happy to
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
repeat as much is necessary but what we
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
were talking about earlier of the 340b
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
program we are I really believe this
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
close because I heard back from one of
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
our Representatives at the AG's office
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
to signing um to moving forward with a
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
confidential disclosure agreement so
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we can talk with another company
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
about further reducing our pricing on
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
epclusa finally one of um I think the
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
committee respectfully I think you all
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
know that a large majority of our
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
Healthcare staff are contracted through
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
the RFP process with a vendor called
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
Wexford we meet with them regularly in
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
addition to contract has a critical
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
performance indicator that helps manage
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
um if costs are expended above and
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
beyond inflation and 10% right 10% of
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
the previous pardon me the previous
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
quarter and so there is a a tie in a
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
penalty quite frankly back if their
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
prescribers are not following some of
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
what we would consider to be standard
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
utilization management procedures in
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
fact um we are in the process of looking
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
at Q the second quarter of this fiscal
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
year and we'll adjust our invoice from
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
them based on that so we are we are open
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
always looking for suggestions so but I
 
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
do want to assure you we always are
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
looking at ways to save money and M just
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out as the governor
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
pointed out Democrats are fiscally
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
responsible and we we're doing we're
 
01:38:54.589 --> 01:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
doing we're doing we're doing our job
 
01:38:57.270 --> 01:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
and we address every issue based on
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
based on the the the the cost and Cost
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
Containment thank you Mr chairman move
 
01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:04.030 align:start position:0%
Containment thank you Mr chairman move
the

01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
it I do have a question Mr chairman let
 
01:39:08.430 --> 01:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
me get a second and then we'll go on
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
with further second from motion by
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
represent Senator gray to adopt second
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
by Senator delis Sandro further
 
01:39:19.510 --> 01:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
discussion represent lean thank you Mr
 
01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:21.560 align:start position:0%
chairman U and thanks for being here and
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
certainly commend the commissioner and
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
the staff I understand that you folks
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
are the best or one of the best state
 
01:39:29.550 --> 01:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
run prisons in the country based on what
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
we heard the other day uh do you
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate in the next fiscal year 25
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
that you'll probably have a similar
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
request of $4.6 million to cover these
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
additional medical
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
expenses thank you for the question
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
um we do not because we believe that
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have made sign ific gains with our
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
primary cost driver treating hepatitis C
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
however and having been someone who
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
worked in hospital Administration versus
 
01:40:01.159 --> 01:40:03.270 align:start position:0%
worked in hospital Administration versus
Corrections

01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
Corrections
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
um some of the forecasting changes in
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
Corrections we have no knowledge of what
 
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
is happening um in specific knowledge of
 
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
what is occurring in our state until of
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
who's coming our way until they're there
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
on our doorsteps an example um not
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
related to this particular budget item
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
but it's the cleanest example I can
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
think of we uh budget every year for
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
dialysis some years we spend absolutely
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
no dollars on dialysis some years as
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
like this one we get halfway through the
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then we get a dialysis
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
patient who needs it three days a week
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
that we didn't know is coming now please
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
understand we' budgeted it's not related
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
to this request but it gives you an
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
example of
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
the difficulties the challenges in
 
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
forecasting and predicting who's coming
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
through our doors um that being said we
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
um certainly look at uh from year to
 
01:41:07.149 --> 01:41:07.159 align:start position:0%
year what we're expending looking at
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
factors what may change that and budget
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you thank you for
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
the thank you for the question thank so
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
much thanks Mr
 
01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Edwards for a
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair and and
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh represent 's question sort of
 
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
triggered this thought I it it seems to
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
me like we have a huge uh budget driver
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the future related to
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
biologics could is isn't that going to
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
be a a big cost driver in future budgets
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't we be expecting that
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
you'll be
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
requesting a lot more money what to what
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
do you think the future of biologics is
 
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.030 align:start position:0%
do you think the future of biologics is
and

01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections want to clarify um thank you
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
for the question I want to clarify um
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
when you use the term biologics can you
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
tell me tell us please specifically what
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking at and then we would love
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
to answer that question I I can't a
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
answer it very specifically but it's my
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have a new line of
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
drugs that are being uh almost uh
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
uniquely engineered for a particular
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
patients um medical conditions and what
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
their Gene code is and and so these
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
biologics are becoming very uh precise
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
and targeted and they're and
 
01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.669 align:start position:0%
and targeted and they're and
expensive

01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
please thank you for your question uh so
 
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
what what we are seeing right now uh is
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
is an increase in those products but we
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
are also at a point where we are seeing
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
um equivalents of those products become
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
available in the marketplace um one of
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
the uh more recent products Humira has
 
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
had a uh a Marketplace equivalent come
 
01:42:55.390 --> 01:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
out called Head Lima that product is one
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
of the actual cost so for what we could
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
treat one patient uh before on Huma we
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
now can treat five patients uh and we're
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
seeing that across the board the as
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
these drugs start to develop um we're
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
seeing more and more of these drugs
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
become uh or or we wouldn't call them
 
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
generics directly because they're uh
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
biologically designed but they're uh
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
equivalents to these products um and
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
they are significantly less expensive to
 
01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:23.870 align:start position:0%
they are significantly less expensive to
the

01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
depart

01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay we did have a motion right yes all
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
right had a motion on a second on item
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
2452 is there any further discussion
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none you're ready for the
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
question all in favor say I I oppose no
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
you we're left with information items
 
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
and audits any questions on information
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:27.270 align:start position:0%
 
audits

01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.189 --> 01:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
other the report submitted by HHS the
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
laps number was going to be recorded the
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
potential laps number it it hasn't been
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
on it's been on previous reports on the
 
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
dashboard we're looking for that I think
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
we we got that message to yeah we had a
 
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
discussion with the LBA about how you
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
know what a wild ass guess that was
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
right and uh they're going to try to do
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
better right thank you thank you thank
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%

presentation thank you
 
01:45:46.589 --> 01:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
perfect Representatives uh it's always a
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
highlight of my year to come here and uh
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
present the results of the 529 audits
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh just great to see how government
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
really works uh behind the scenes and
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
it's always certainly uh one of the
 
01:45:58.589 --> 01:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
highlights of my year even though it's
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
always cold um but nonetheless I'm here
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
to present the the results of the 529
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
plans and thankfully as again I come
 
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
here bearing good news and um and I know
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
we've provided the materials in advance
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
and I won't go Page by Page by any
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
manner of means but I just I just refer
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
you to page five and I'll just give a
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
highlight of the audit which which went
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
swimmingly um I'm have to say we got
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
great collaboration with the with the
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
team here uh trer audits we also got
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
great collaboration from Fidelity
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
Fidelity plays a a huge role in
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining the books and records of
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
transacting the part plan participant
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
accounts and uh giving the support we
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
need to provide uh our audit services
 
01:46:40.229 --> 01:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
and and get us over the line um so
 
01:46:42.750 --> 01:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
overall a really successful audit and
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just highlight a few few comments
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
in this page just to to round out these
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
are a lot of the um required
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
Communications I would say that we have
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
to talk about as part of the the close
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
out to the audit but by and large really
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
good successful audit um and just to
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
drill down a bit when we think about the
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
the execution the audit we design it and
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
think about it in the summer time frame
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
we we look at the controls of fidelity
 
01:47:07.790 --> 01:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
we talk to the state we see what's
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
changing we look at the external Market
 
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
what's out there that would really would
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
change our judgment as Auditors of how
 
01:47:15.629 --> 01:47:15.639 align:start position:0%
we approach the audit thankfully as we
 
01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
went through the fall um and then start
 
01:47:20.109 --> 01:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
getting into the work really no change
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
in how we we approach the audit stable
 
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
control environment stable sock ones and
 
01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
they are really the reports that we rely
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
on at Fidelity so everything was pretty
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
stable from a from an execution
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint you know the valuation was
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
good the confirmation process was good
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
presentation disclosure was really well
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
well done by Fidelity and and again
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
great um anything we needed from the
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
state we got a timely and on time so we
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
released our audit opinions in advance
 
01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
of the holidays in around December 2 1
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh 14th and the 21st so that was exactly
 
01:47:56.270 --> 01:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
On Target so again no major delays at
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
all um and then from a from a result
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
standpoint we really have nothing of
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
significance of a negative manner to
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
report you um and I'll highlight no
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses so what that really
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
means is we we looked at the design of
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
the control environment both of fidelity
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
and the state and we made a judgment
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
based on our the the results of our Auto
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
work no real material weaknesses no
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
control matters that we were worrisome
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
that were call into question you know
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
future errors no errors noted no
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
uncorrected misstatements nothing that
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
we passed on from a judgment standpoint
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
nothing what we found that was booked by
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
management um and that's that's a good
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
result and we do spend a lot of time on
 
01:48:36.990 --> 01:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
Fidelity transaction processing like I
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
said and and they are key cog in this
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
process and we certainly were able to
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
get everything we needed from them so we
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
didn't come across anything from the
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
first draft to the last draft to really
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
have significance that needed to change
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
and then thankfully no fraud or error so
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
everybody's on their best behavior and
 
01:48:56.070 --> 01:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
um no non-compliance with laws and
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
regulations which are pretty pretty
 
01:49:00.189 --> 01:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
critical for us um we do have some new
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
portfolios this year and that's an
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
important process to make sure they're
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
set up right in year one and and make
 
01:49:08.589 --> 01:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
sure the opening NE is accurate and all
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
all the numbers are good so we just
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
highlight that there were some new areas
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
for this year and then and slide seven
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
and and eight and nine I I I think
 
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
reaffirm just under the Professional
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
Standards what we need to tell you but
 
01:49:22.470 --> 01:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned the quality financial
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
statements were were really good um
 
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
there's no change in the standards much
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
this year so that that was positive no
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
no no arguments no um disagreements with
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
management and no major difficulties in
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the the audit and um you know
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
we we do highlight in some of the
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
appendices you know how how we approach
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%

further

01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing now I the clerk reminds
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
me we have already had the motion to
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
accept the report in the usual manner
 
01:53:13.709 --> 01:53:13.719 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times we need the motion to
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
include to keep it on file and other
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
things so is if the the motion is proper
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
then we can go ahead if not we need to
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
modify it uh we took it back in November
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
because the treasur is required to
 
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
disclose that prior so you're all set
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
with putting it on file uh releasing
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
public Etc no more motions are necessary
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%

right I have a proposal for March 15 for
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%

acceptable that that's good with me I
 
01:54:02.189 --> 01:54:02.199 align:start position:0%

01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
